DUMMY2/p280/p280_152.wav|52|Did it work ?
DUMMY2/p240/p240_006.wav|93|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_391.wav|55|I've kept him in touch with everything.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_226.wav|83|I would like to focus on a structure and a target.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_240.wav|74|He had been surprised by the local reaction.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_415.wav|103|There was a fine line to tread.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_387.wav|67|That team is due to be announced this morning.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_280.wav|15|It has been a major success.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_005.wav|24|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_369.wav|106|Truth is the child of time.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_399.wav|6|There is a lack of logic.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_141.wav|85|I don't have many friends.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_183.wav|39|Irvine said his company was intent on supporting the Scottish dairy industry.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_223.wav|105|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_287.wav|5|You feel very helpless.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_360.wav|13|Does it, Noel?
DUMMY2/p266/p266_226.wav|20|They tried to give her advice.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_312.wav|61|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_044.wav|56|My fitness was very poor.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_376.wav|100|He took a draw on his cigarette.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_247.wav|43|We did not compete with any other local farmer.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_175.wav|40|One season, they might do well.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_219.wav|10|It was important to win the singles.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_372.wav|56|They were to blame for the first two goals.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_054.wav|62|The children are being very brave.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_280.wav|102|THE US is a diverse and colourful nation.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_335.wav|53|Sports Secretary Chris Smith welcomed the action.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_158.wav|49|That doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_394.wav|13|But that title is a mistake.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_122.wav|34|However, the move was bitterly criticised last night.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_286.wav|23|I don't know why she is not here.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_186.wav|7|Each case is treated on merit.)
DUMMY2/p238/p238_109.wav|37|England were ahead until two minutes into injury time.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_340.wav|0|Do you think we are a top nation ?
DUMMY2/p308/p308_358.wav|107|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_183.wav|56|Why change it ?
DUMMY2/p305/p305_388.wav|54|Two years ago, the commission did not want to get involved.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_419.wav|20|It is legally binding.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_151.wav|4|You just know it.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_140.wav|98|We did not have a clue.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_033.wav|37|Mr Darling yesterday dismissed the criticism.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_415.wav|79|We told them in July.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_371.wav|32|How do you take them away ?)
DUMMY2/p234/p234_290.wav|3|The party has never fully recovered.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_017.wav|90|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_048.wav|83|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_068.wav|55|People come to see the Highlands.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_314.wav|21|You know the sort of thing.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_057.wav|82|He was between people and God.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_251.wav|70|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_330.wav|25|He did a good job.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_074.wav|75|We did it for the jersey.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_341.wav|17|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_166.wav|69|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_182.wav|67|It is a memorial.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_182.wav|106|There's still plenty time left.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_352.wav|91|Law abiding motorists have nothing to fear.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_136.wav|70|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_261.wav|74|Shelter also supports the reform.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_241.wav|22|That is nearly four people every day.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_404.wav|48|Civic leaders yesterday praised the good behaviour of revellers across the country.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_148.wav|57|It is difficult for Ali.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_132.wav|4|Did he always want to be a comedian?
DUMMY2/p240/p240_083.wav|93|He is in the queue.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_102.wav|53|We will be putting in a written appeal tomorrow morning.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_131.wav|17|David was not either.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_095.wav|12|The mood is upbeat.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_430.wav|100|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_297.wav|15|There will be new memories.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_250.wav|29|Moreover, it must be for all sports.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_338.wav|40|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_107.wav|36|What do we do ?
DUMMY2/p275/p275_351.wav|40|Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_307.wav|76|I never had any confidence in it afterwards.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_020.wav|10|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_250.wav|3|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_115.wav|14|Scotland will be an integral part of Abbey National.)
DUMMY2/p259/p259_220.wav|7|The result is utterly compelling.)
DUMMY2/p270/p270_197.wav|8|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_058.wav|96|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_309.wav|48|The company hopes to repeat the process in France.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_244.wav|49|Not that Agassi was a believer.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_176.wav|11|It was a day for records.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_174.wav|12|It was a bit like having children.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_055.wav|62|They have a car and cannot afford another.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_284.wav|62|Knowledge is everything at this level.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_177.wav|39|The Internet is no substitute for customer service.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_067.wav|68|Most people know that.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_173.wav|42|Scottish Athletics is opposed to permitting a move.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_417.wav|72|I would think they are just behind them.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_234.wav|87|Kingfisher reports interim figures tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_278.wav|39|The distinction is also supported by doctors.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_058.wav|68|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_231.wav|21|It's always the same, isn't it?
DUMMY2/p240/p240_226.wav|93|What was the main difference?
DUMMY2/p343/p343_209.wav|21|Children also died in Britain.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_332.wav|25|It is so unfair.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_166.wav|40|Was this element always there?
DUMMY2/p273/p273_386.wav|56|The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_226.wav|30|It is a form of physical exercise.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_124.wav|35|She was also very brave.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_065.wav|61|Art is extra.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_122.wav|63|I'm pleased to get through the opening match.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_255.wav|62|It lasted longer than we thought.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_116.wav|57|However, they will only be found in the wild.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_351.wav|12|This time, however, there is a new venue.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_177.wav|62|They are going to carry it through.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_210.wav|85|We are in this for the long haul.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_374.wav|98|Tyson said he had made a mistake.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_299.wav|32|It is a flexible concept.)
DUMMY2/p262/p262_077.wav|45|Detection is often difficult.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_287.wav|102|They don't know each other, but they have made this commitment.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_219.wav|76|He's very, very lucky to be alive.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_123.wav|56|It feels like a privilege.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_023.wav|83|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_352.wav|40|The pair are very much in love.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_007.wav|17|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_204.wav|33|The man was pronounced dead on arrival.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_383.wav|36|He has an equity stake in the investment house.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_176.wav|27|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_196.wav|54|Eight new hospitals are set to be built.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_136.wav|52|Therefore, no-one can work full time in these companies.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_305.wav|72|I can't say that this is very usual.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_132.wav|78|It is hard to believe.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_167.wav|21|Are his works inside out?
DUMMY2/p258/p258_267.wav|26|I saw one body.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_462.wav|50|Let that be their memorial.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_241.wav|101|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_357.wav|21|Tenants will be unable to defend themselves.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_362.wav|78|The parents will have a great time, too.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_301.wav|68|This can only help us go forward.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_231.wav|87|Finding suitable replacements would not be easy.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_305.wav|23|No, we had nothing to do with the Jews.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_393.wav|26|One day, he threw the baby against a wall.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_088.wav|37|It was exactly four months away.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_248.wav|101|Does that put pressure on us ?
DUMMY2/p376/p376_045.wav|71|"It's the same old story."
DUMMY2/p276/p276_363.wav|106|It is a triumphant performance, which defies the years.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_183.wav|61|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_292.wav|46|Receiving this medal is an honour.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_384.wav|100|We regret that they were brought in the first place.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_331.wav|91|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_079.wav|9|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_178.wav|20|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_038.wav|32|Among them are many criminals.)
DUMMY2/p282/p282_057.wav|83|I was lost.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_055.wav|43|However, he will now have to wait for his chance to impress.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_240.wav|47|It's too much work.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_144.wav|2|The amount of energy in a tornado is enormous.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_054.wav|19|He will be judged by his actions.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_200.wav|38|We believe that the reason is poverty.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_297.wav|21|It's ahead of Labour.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_019.wav|30|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_201.wav|29|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_122.wav|29|So, did she meet him ?
DUMMY2/p286/p286_281.wav|63|The result was a crisis for the global financial system.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_064.wav|38|He's very good at relating to adults.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_378.wav|48|I love the spectacle of cinema.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_062.wav|61|None has ever been found.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_406.wav|92|I didn't want to ignore the punters.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_072.wav|9|It was chaotic.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_064.wav|32|There could be a way back.)
DUMMY2/p292/p292_384.wav|13|This season has been a nightmare.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_245.wav|18|It is very enjoyable.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_038.wav|63|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_181.wav|16|What has caused the demise of singing?
DUMMY2/p241/p241_359.wav|86|So I left.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_392.wav|84|He has not created a Festival resource.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_372.wav|70|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_044.wav|39|It will come all right.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_017.wav|38|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_080.wav|105|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_385.wav|84|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_195.wav|79|You look at that.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_003.wav|40|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_301.wav|79|Then it will come.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_427.wav|24|I am astonished at attack.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_299.wav|103|This is a long-term discussion paper.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_450.wav|48|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_202.wav|81|I am delighted for Simon.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_029.wav|83|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_155.wav|82|It may have been a cry for help.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_216.wav|5|Because they didn't want to know.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_262.wav|35|Persuaded to change his mind.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_041.wav|66|He was arrested, but later released without charge.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_414.wav|107|The problem in Norway is outside the National.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_041.wav|46|Slowly, however, a picture is emerging in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_046.wav|44|I did not want any damage to us.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_235.wav|62|I love the tradition of vaudeville.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_193.wav|79|That is clearly not happening fast enough.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_412.wav|77|They are looking for profit.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_395.wav|17|I don't think it's vital.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_386.wav|94|You can cope with it.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_061.wav|73|A parliament for England is the only way to redress the balance.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_002.wav|15|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_241.wav|72|We are now open.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_116.wav|53|Had this been common practice ?
DUMMY2/p255/p255_016.wav|31|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_302.wav|12|It had not been a terribly inspiring end, either.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_137.wav|79|It was highly successful.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_338.wav|11|It was a matter of choice.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_137.wav|78|So, did she meet him ?
DUMMY2/p347/p347_319.wav|46|Although it was expected, everyone is very, very angry.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_241.wav|25|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_132.wav|96|I am now unemployed.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_122.wav|67|Maybe this battle has been.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_174.wav|82|Bombing is the easy option.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_255.wav|41|It's a source of deep concern.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_279.wav|28|That is where our future lies.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_087.wav|47|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_042.wav|104|It wasn't a flight of fancy.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_381.wav|17|I've heard this stuff about the markets.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_127.wav|31|It will be too hot.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_317.wav|4|But don't just take my word, for it.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_336.wav|67|The team for the first game could be this one.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_177.wav|6|It is all credit to them today.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_396.wav|74|He got his degree.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_307.wav|84|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_069.wav|6|The show is not over.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_222.wav|76|If not, he should go home.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_149.wav|104|I'm sure that is not.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_296.wav|81|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_282.wav|44|She had been sexually assaulted.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_246.wav|57|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_136.wav|54|Our plans for Dunfermline have not changed.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_187.wav|104|I want my mum.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_287.wav|22|It's not unlike the millennium bug.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_069.wav|86|I was just trying to win the golf tournament.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_340.wav|95|A new school will be built.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_005.wav|31|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_307.wav|42|I can understand the frustrations of our fans.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_012.wav|15|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_404.wav|52|My views on the decision are well known.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_326.wav|57|It is a sign of hope.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_349.wav|63|What form did that take ?
DUMMY2/p286/p286_113.wav|63|But I know the course.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_026.wav|105|Is this accurate?
DUMMY2/p247/p247_203.wav|14|Because he was born in England.)
DUMMY2/p351/p351_206.wav|33|Like everything in Scotland, it takes time.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_139.wav|5|She died at her home.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_081.wav|39|Are you from the rugby ?
DUMMY2/p270/p270_460.wav|8|They're just a good retailer.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_277.wav|86|We are a grandmother.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_060.wav|16|Lancashire Police said they were not treating the death as suspicious.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_132.wav|84|He's been the key to everything.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_224.wav|70|I didn't play too well in the third quarter.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_365.wav|50|Neither woman has been named.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_117.wav|76|They will be destroyed.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_286.wav|7|You have got the evidence.)
DUMMY2/p364/p364_274.wav|88|We are keen to have him back.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_407.wav|92|Boy is the town a mess.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_288.wav|89|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_161.wav|14|His second goal was equally impressive.)
DUMMY2/p297/p297_079.wav|42|Then he did it twice.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_107.wav|42|No other vehicle was involved in the incident.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_247.wav|94|You can feel at home in China.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_346.wav|93|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_382.wav|79|He certainly would have approved.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_299.wav|72|He will feel the pain again.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_193.wav|46|That certainly brought me back down to earth.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_292.wav|65|It's just an area of water.)
DUMMY2/p226/p226_116.wav|43|It is normal.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_384.wav|16|I was lost.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_102.wav|29|Saddam Hussein is a devil.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_158.wav|22|That's why the young musicians have joined.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_023.wav|16|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_225.wav|51|The island will never recover.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_147.wav|74|It added to the spectacle.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_404.wav|56|She started to put on weight.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_361.wav|77|They were the acts of men.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_120.wav|42|Our lives have been turned upside down.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_308.wav|81|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_253.wav|17|I was happiest with my short game.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_417.wav|77|There is a solution, she believes.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_156.wav|45|He's been the key to everything.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_045.wav|91|It's like, If he's all right, we will go with him.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_039.wav|51|His concern is only for the future.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_081.wav|92|We're just delighted to be back on top.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_308.wav|101|I thought his speech was a disgrace.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_111.wav|80|We want to get to the final, anyway.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_356.wav|57|Equity declined to comment.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_095.wav|81|I love the Dome.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_032.wav|71|"We want to ensure that the process is entirely transparent."
DUMMY2/p295/p295_361.wav|92|But everyone is entitled to their own opinion.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_057.wav|70|I was lost.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_009.wav|35|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_178.wav|70|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_375.wav|64|Public confidence was undermined by that terrible tragedy.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_333.wav|87|Thereafter they were allowed to proceed.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_055.wav|66|I've just got to do this.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_322.wav|9|We are now looking at the degrees of injury.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_130.wav|9|We had a reunion last week.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_190.wav|53|That capital would be provided equally by the State and established commercial companies.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_356.wav|94|It was so new, so exciting.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_245.wav|51|I look for dancers who are also actors.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_073.wav|31|He is now resident in England.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_245.wav|63|The scientific debate is dead.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_030.wav|103|That their music is truly, truly, truly great.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_227.wav|63|The move follows a review of the Singapore
DUMMY2/p274/p274_309.wav|32|Maloney is an engaging talent.)
DUMMY2/p246/p246_286.wav|5|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_265.wav|71|"And Michael was just great."
DUMMY2/p339/p339_052.wav|18|But they were true stories.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_356.wav|14|Other people had looked at it.)
DUMMY2/p306/p306_282.wav|12|That was merely their initial problem.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_191.wav|107|It's amazing it happened in the daytime.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_192.wav|16|I have a cold.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_313.wav|53|For that reason cover should not be given.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_109.wav|15|A, The media has been great.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_151.wav|22|I haven't just gone in, done a three-hour rehearsal, and gone.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_106.wav|104|The other conditions were not specified.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_229.wav|29|It's just a normal life.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_155.wav|4|At Westminster, there was disbelief at the news.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_275.wav|87|They made such decisions in London.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_327.wav|60|That was the gimmick.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_002.wav|63|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_001.wav|97|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_102.wav|102|Where is the anthrax?
DUMMY2/p351/p351_156.wav|33|THE Paragon Ensemble is back.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_242.wav|1|You would fall over, he said.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_381.wav|41|Face to face
DUMMY2/p362/p362_008.wav|15|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_051.wav|100|I must take a seat.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_002.wav|35|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_009.wav|6|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_239.wav|93|It's very safe.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_420.wav|37|They prefer the short, intensive session.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_359.wav|70|The death rates are still as high.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_040.wav|14|It is serious - but not that serious.)
DUMMY2/p258/p258_219.wav|26|His death was a tragic accident.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_111.wav|66|If you could have dinner with anyone, who would it be?
DUMMY2/p333/p333_134.wav|64|Our idea is to make it entirely Irish.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_083.wav|96|That is bound to happen.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_285.wav|95|We need to establish the facts.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_064.wav|8|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_061.wav|94|There was a battle there.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_058.wav|2|It's that kind of place.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_220.wav|68|You know, he was struggling with his game all week.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_043.wav|42|He, too, was unlucky not to get a goal.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_274.wav|1|All kinds of things occur.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_159.wav|74|It will not happen overnight.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_026.wav|4|It's ahead of Labour.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_337.wav|103|We have nothing to hide.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_271.wav|84|It looks as though he will be right.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_250.wav|65|We really are a team.)
DUMMY2/p257/p257_167.wav|105|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_236.wav|1|Will they ever reopen?
DUMMY2/p297/p297_059.wav|42|People will see this over time.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_182.wav|31|We wanted it left for a wee while.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_167.wav|33|He is very confident at the moment.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_274.wav|33|They were too hard.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_211.wav|51|He added,  It is all about the search for power.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_128.wav|86|Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_174.wav|65|Now he's back on top again.)
DUMMY2/p304/p304_266.wav|72|The look on his face was something special.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_242.wav|105|We decided we would go for a specialist inside centre.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_239.wav|107|They follow him everywhere.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_483.wav|75|We had to add value.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_093.wav|67|Well, the big day has arrived.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_290.wav|53|He has been chosen as captain because of the person he is.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_125.wav|52|I think there's not much between them.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_189.wav|46|There was an element of jealousy.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_252.wav|98|She has a little boy.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_167.wav|12|Where are his symphonies and major concertos?
DUMMY2/p278/p278_195.wav|10|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_159.wav|102|They thought they had found a home.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_216.wav|47|Who was on the panel?
DUMMY2/p275/p275_200.wav|40|Tommy is not a problem.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_146.wav|36|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_309.wav|89|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_190.wav|80|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_067.wav|43|It's a matter of balance.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_321.wav|60|He has yet to receive a reply.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_236.wav|19|Home is in the Scottish Borders.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_002.wav|94|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_186.wav|34|The game is now open.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_395.wav|85|That is not too bad.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_047.wav|99|It is urgent.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_182.wav|3|There remains an outstanding damages action against the former.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_110.wav|0|Well, you can have a tree.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_204.wav|9|I saw some terrible things.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_015.wav|104|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_070.wav|6|Saddam Hussein is a devil.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_132.wav|77|That is the real test.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_262.wav|57|He thought he had a month to cross the street.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_095.wav|58|Our offer will remain on the table.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_232.wav|82|This is my homeland.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_211.wav|10|He is a good signing for Rangers.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_315.wav|93|It is no surprise.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_193.wav|10|But there's an upturn in the sector.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_220.wav|89|They must do it.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_099.wav|90|It was clear.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_263.wav|84|I've spent a lot of time on buses.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_419.wav|104|We have every respect for Michelle.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_232.wav|35|I was not sure whether I had won.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_263.wav|100|It seems a shame to leave it.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_202.wav|4|They are now out in the cold.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_189.wav|64|I was chosen to do this.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_002.wav|1|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_111.wav|59|I can't even get into the A team.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_058.wav|7|We have to keep our clients.)
DUMMY2/p313/p313_185.wav|76|The United Nations must act.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_001.wav|42|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_239.wav|62|I think it was his parents.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_194.wav|21|Surrender is not an appealing or realistic prospect.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_111.wav|50|New Year will be very busy.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_295.wav|16|Who can predict?
DUMMY2/p345/p345_319.wav|82|Is she in trouble?
DUMMY2/p264/p264_460.wav|65|We have very limited capacity.)
DUMMY2/p300/p300_097.wav|102|It's not a new concept in jazz.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_108.wav|46|Clark is back on top form.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_375.wav|13|That's an equally important factor.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_123.wav|69|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_186.wav|19|Sponsors include the Sunday Herald.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_142.wav|72|That's a pretty good percentage.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_374.wav|56|Scrutiny by the European Parliament is limited.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_018.wav|98|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_349.wav|51|Scottish life can be like this, too.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_024.wav|81|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_155.wav|54|Blair also faces pressure from within the cabinet.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_119.wav|6|Only the details have to be sorted out.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_320.wav|3|He refused to reveal the reasons for the split.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_082.wav|97|They have a way of proclaiming themselves.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_324.wav|50|We have got no money to go anywhere.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_284.wav|29|There's not much money in cycling.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_188.wav|26|If the director is with you.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_156.wav|40|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_432.wav|48|They are interior designers and architects.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_291.wav|78|None of the agencies was able to help.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_277.wav|83|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_339.wav|59|I would miss him.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_182.wav|84|He will feel the pain again.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_059.wav|63|The cuts were made within an hour of each other.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_114.wav|101|I told him I was a long time ago.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_021.wav|47|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_023.wav|32|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. )
DUMMY2/p259/p259_434.wav|7|They've also enjoyed their share of good fortune.)
DUMMY2/p335/p335_103.wav|49|We knew nothing about it.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_154.wav|10|It was by the numbers.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_072.wav|36|So is that it, then ?
DUMMY2/p376/p376_237.wav|71|"You can feel at home in China."
DUMMY2/p273/p273_344.wav|56|My view has now completely changed.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_045.wav|102|They said construction work could begin within weeks.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_417.wav|46|There's nothing for you here.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_280.wav|66|I hope my successor will do the same.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_037.wav|98|That incident altered the pattern of the game.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_212.wav|40|It had all been arranged.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_366.wav|60|It will set the tone.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_119.wav|49|Britain may now be forced to listen.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_020.wav|21|Many contemplated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_357.wav|32|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.)
DUMMY2/p292/p292_283.wav|13|This is a national crisis.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_046.wav|3|The man became a reporter.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_129.wav|90|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_373.wav|16|The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_083.wav|58|He will be sentenced tomorrow by Lord Dawson.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_390.wav|75|She is in their hands.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_392.wav|19|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_102.wav|20|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_045.wav|23|He denied that he was an absentee landlord.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_346.wav|15|So far he has not done so.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_153.wav|18|In fact, the reasons are simple.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_067.wav|8|It wasn't possible to relax.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_326.wav|97|Scotland is one of the favourites, with Glasgow to the fore.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_350.wav|25|He has seen the past.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_288.wav|15|I don't see any problem.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_228.wav|62|It was no avail.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_204.wav|75|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_111.wav|92|She said she would not welcome the flowers.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_102.wav|92|Eriksson did his countrymen a disservice.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_370.wav|38|It is a triumphant performance, which defies the years.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_402.wav|8|Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_305.wav|74|We will not give up on the truth.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_324.wav|68|I'll go out and be aggressive.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_123.wav|86|I'm so angry.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_274.wav|93|He was also married with two children.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_124.wav|28|Nor is he allowed out without permission.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_310.wav|46|It's my favourite place to hang out.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_203.wav|58|I think the Government should pay for that.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_015.wav|45|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_383.wav|24|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_180.wav|29|That will apply to both sets of fans.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_332.wav|11|Harrowing is easy, after all.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_380.wav|93|Safety was also an issue.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_087.wav|99|Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_438.wav|65|However, the proposal is not aimed at rugby, but at all sports.)
DUMMY2/p266/p266_058.wav|20|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_269.wav|60|The bottom line is that this must stop.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_406.wav|33|So it's a daily struggle.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_007.wav|47|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_167.wav|103|I see the extended family once a year.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_131.wav|9|If not, a deal could take many months.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_413.wav|7|The director will be present.)
DUMMY2/p287/p287_420.wav|77|I'm pleased about one thing.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_008.wav|72|These take the shape of a long round arc, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_206.wav|83|Feel the heat?
DUMMY2/p279/p279_162.wav|25|As, indeed, they would be.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_278.wav|14|On the contrary they stand to gain.)
DUMMY2/p276/p276_228.wav|106|I would not say that.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_226.wav|43|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_264.wav|40|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_176.wav|71|"We are very concerned about controller fatigue."
DUMMY2/p333/p333_145.wav|64|That is impressive by any standards.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_017.wav|27|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_283.wav|39|They can leave at any time.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_125.wav|89|Who would have?
DUMMY2/p258/p258_215.wav|26|We want to keep the pound.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_036.wav|100|He is believed to live in Britain.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_281.wav|19|It was a foolhardy decision.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_287.wav|49|Others were even less confident.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_183.wav|69|Our team is just so young.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_198.wav|89|They make a selective perception process.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_228.wav|51|Those who are unwilling or unable to improve.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_332.wav|35|I can see their argument.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_365.wav|39|There is a range of employers.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_090.wav|97|There is no signature on this document.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_343.wav|65|The European elections revealed a lack of interest and a lack of knowledge.)
DUMMY2/p299/p299_309.wav|58|I thought he was part of the camera.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_405.wav|48|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_171.wav|59|People will ask about us.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_138.wav|37|Monty is great in his own backyard.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_042.wav|20|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_211.wav|101|He added that he was very sad about O Neill.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_045.wav|94|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_198.wav|72|He was tough and relentless.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_076.wav|91|This is a mental challenge.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_340.wav|59|There's no place to hide.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_043.wav|9|Dancing was her life.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_306.wav|28|She has seen, or heard, it all.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_147.wav|80|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_068.wav|32|So is that it, then ?)
DUMMY2/p273/p273_038.wav|56|He looks like an Afghan.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_147.wav|91|And a mightily impressive recording it is, too.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_312.wav|72|The working families tax credit is far better.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_100.wav|26|It's not perfect.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_300.wav|97|This is the start of a new campaign.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_168.wav|40|I was in the train station overnight.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_173.wav|44|We're all family men with children.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_385.wav|64|It was a lot of hard work, but it wasn't difficult.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_214.wav|61|There was an e-mail.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_092.wav|47|Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_257.wav|67|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_057.wav|57|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_179.wav|57|Mr Blunkett said he was deeply concerned by the ruling.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_133.wav|100|This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_449.wav|63|National Farmer's Union of Scotland president Jim Walker welcomed the new proposals.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_264.wav|15|Boy is the town a mess.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_018.wav|49|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_282.wav|31|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_230.wav|40|My wife and family are the support system.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_332.wav|52|I felt it was time for me to leave to develop my career.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_307.wav|98|It is a daunting task.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_156.wav|101|I would like to see the figures  for the second quarter.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_195.wav|96|I wanted to put myself on the line.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_315.wav|8|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_042.wav|82|You can see how he made his money.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_180.wav|104|My place is in the kitchen.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_262.wav|70|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_230.wav|42|They were the best team, but unlucky in the end.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_452.wav|65|The official also said no groups had made any terrorist claims involving the crash.)
DUMMY2/p360/p360_175.wav|60|There is an ongoing problem with this company.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_244.wav|89|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_363.wav|49|It was a job he loved.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_085.wav|44|We really need research to help with that.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_193.wav|104|Something happened on that island.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_081.wav|61|It's all going to clear the debt.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_062.wav|75|I was very pleased with them today, though.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_068.wav|29|He had been a singer.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_072.wav|48|In fact, it was Geoffrey Robinson.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_068.wav|98|Everyone at the school is delighted for Steven.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_116.wav|31|Does this mean.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_271.wav|6|That should not be their conclusion.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_080.wav|80|Both sides have been hit by injury.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_101.wav|1|Obviously, someone is not doing their job properly.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_393.wav|102|Is the Welsh assembly going to go?
DUMMY2/p305/p305_419.wav|54|I'll take what comes along.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_038.wav|7|It all started with a visiting rugby club.)
DUMMY2/p299/p299_361.wav|58|What's happening to her?
DUMMY2/p341/p341_303.wav|66|Clearly, the IRA has got away with murder.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_282.wav|41|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_106.wav|9|He was jailed for a year.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_107.wav|72|Our children are the future of our society.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_124.wav|93|Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_202.wav|101|The occasion was the New Labour conference in Brighton last year.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_150.wav|96|She had gone to the Catholic school.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_093.wav|24|The excitement could hardly be contained.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_088.wav|26|There was no rescue.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_420.wav|46|I just want to get rid of it.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_318.wav|39|Nothing has been put into action.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_098.wav|49|Harrowing is easy, after all.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_060.wav|98|It was rather a distorted image of Islam.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_397.wav|41|I can lead by example.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_333.wav|20|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_149.wav|56|They should stop the bombing.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_062.wav|22|It didn't work against Sweden, but that was the intention.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_246.wav|40|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_201.wav|43|The service from the other players was super.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_377.wav|91|It is like a theatre of the absurd.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_428.wav|48|Or maybe it's the other way around.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_035.wav|61|I'd like to continue that record.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_392.wav|92|I have played really well all year.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_201.wav|75|It shows the strength of the roots.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_391.wav|79|Everything is coming together well.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_403.wav|60|It has great potential.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_353.wav|22|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_319.wav|105|You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_093.wav|79|I knew him a little.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_100.wav|68|Sooner rather than later, though, the healing must begin.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_389.wav|100|We must put a marker down.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_165.wav|27|It has to be now.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_012.wav|66|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_287.wav|36|What was the matter for concern ?
DUMMY2/p295/p295_089.wav|92|It is giving out the wrong message.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_051.wav|107|There was nobody on the roof.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_156.wav|26|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_168.wav|86|Waiting times for these services are too long.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_053.wav|30|We have to reinforce the pressure on Iraq.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_349.wav|49|It was not confirmed by Scotland Yard.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_079.wav|66|We've always had three options, and none of them are perfect.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_388.wav|2|Stewart will travel with some confidence.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_015.wav|56|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_059.wav|68|The partnership was set up during the summer.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_378.wav|79|I have never seen anything like it.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_369.wav|13|I'm delighted for Andy.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_018.wav|96|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_359.wav|78|Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_166.wav|98|Nobody could survive on that.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_392.wav|89|I love the thought of having a crack at defending the title.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_353.wav|53|The executive has so far not offered any immediate prospect of major change.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_085.wav|99|By then, he was walking on water.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_125.wav|5|I am now unemployed.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_444.wav|24|We know about the crisis in cattle.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_089.wav|91|He is firm but inclusive and very fair.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_093.wav|41|He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_150.wav|9|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_358.wav|15|It is having a big impact.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_131.wav|19|I'd love to be at the World Cup.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_342.wav|56|I'd like to take the plunge.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_271.wav|71|"It was a privilege to work for him."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_397.wav|21|I have hardly any commitments.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_284.wav|20|Domestic Disturbance is currently on general release.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_348.wav|5|Until they came to do it.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_390.wav|15|No progress has been made.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_093.wav|56|Gordon Marshall was outstanding against us.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_193.wav|61|I wish I could say something.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_289.wav|55|Aberdeen had little to offer.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_054.wav|52|The important retail business continues to deliver excellent results, Stewart said.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_263.wav|104|A statement is expected in April.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_113.wav|54|Sentencing is due to take place tomorrow morning.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_289.wav|12|The fund has three elements.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_211.wav|34|One film a year is, he says, his natural rhythm.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_321.wav|14|A Home Office spokesman said.)
DUMMY2/p304/p304_244.wav|72|Now it has become a big picture.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_042.wav|62|I think so - he seems to be in good health.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_188.wav|106|She is in good spirits.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_053.wav|97|Sub Not Used, McCulloch.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_256.wav|68|Partly, but only partly, this is their own fault.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_016.wav|101|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_172.wav|99|They thought they had found a home.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_051.wav|54|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_268.wav|98|We're all going to take a holiday.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_152.wav|89|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_310.wav|47|O Neill is caught between a rock and a hard place.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_123.wav|4|These figures are truly terrible.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_234.wav|13|It was like the old days.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_115.wav|10|It was located on the remote control.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_295.wav|2|She is really magic.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_115.wav|47|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_168.wav|107|After his birthday, Scott was very upset.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_288.wav|38|It's the taking part that counts.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_051.wav|82|It was time to act.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_209.wav|14|It was worth a photograph.)
DUMMY2/p351/p351_277.wav|33|I don't take that view.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_058.wav|54|This film will be totally awesome.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_179.wav|86|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_303.wav|53|Are you from the rugby ?
DUMMY2/p329/p329_398.wav|103|The issue has still to be resolved.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_168.wav|92|He should emerge as the winner.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_250.wav|5|Is there on his hands?
DUMMY2/p248/p248_360.wav|99|He could face a jail sentence.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_345.wav|92|Genetic assessment is crucial.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_327.wav|49|If they have City backing, what is the influence?
DUMMY2/p308/p308_032.wav|107|He is not very big, either.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_367.wav|93|As, indeed, they would be.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_117.wav|79|He was taken ill in his office.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_379.wav|42|Everyone has his share of trouble.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_176.wav|6|Her body has never been found.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_194.wav|92|Defeat is simply not an option.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_025.wav|28|Jimmy returned to Aberdeen, but she remained with George.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_006.wav|88|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_285.wav|70|Who did the recruiting?
DUMMY2/p310/p310_056.wav|17|How can they engage with the work?
DUMMY2/p323/p323_295.wav|34|She was making a living, but her career was going nowhere.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_145.wav|97|A Foreign Office spokesman declined to comment.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_190.wav|95|Well, this article is a bit like that.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_253.wav|6|I sit in the car.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_269.wav|55|We still think this trade is on the increase.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_202.wav|1|There was no time scale.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_038.wav|98|IT is a terrible equation.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_137.wav|71|"He sees a difference in the style of the two teams."
DUMMY2/p232/p232_086.wav|96|She had kept the news from him.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_325.wav|10|Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_050.wav|12|Except for this, it was offside.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_125.wav|41|I could see his desire for the job in his eyes.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_143.wav|76|However, consumers may take a different view.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_330.wav|98|That could be in place by next year.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_021.wav|52|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_032.wav|103|The merger was welcomed by Tony Blair.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_171.wav|103|Tony Blair, can you see her face?
DUMMY2/p374/p374_389.wav|11|It was good today.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_265.wav|102|Holland won by five wickets.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_421.wav|19|It appears to have been closed down.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_261.wav|81|This is a question of Islam.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_175.wav|50|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_185.wav|14|City sentiment is in his favour.)
DUMMY2/p312/p312_251.wav|62|All would be under threat.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_238.wav|15|The Prime Minister has been in touch.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_219.wav|82|I am going to fight to the end.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_302.wav|105|In fact, they have the opposite effect.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_227.wav|29|My daughter is an adult.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_367.wav|85|It is based on his movement records.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_074.wav|82|How do we get more people in?
DUMMY2/p269/p269_016.wav|94|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_215.wav|104|They will form a tribute.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_401.wav|52|Today he will meet the Italian press but he will give little away.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_165.wav|82|We don't have a solution to the problem.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_178.wav|89|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_128.wav|16|No production was achieved.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_078.wav|64|I think we will join the single currency.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_061.wav|28|Mr Blunkett was convinced.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_123.wav|83|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_079.wav|70|People must remain vigilant.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_271.wav|64|I know when my time is, it doesn't bother me.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_392.wav|105|Not because they want to sing about something.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_010.wav|6|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_143.wav|96|They did very well.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_333.wav|84|Gaelic provision continued to be good.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_197.wav|52|What was the matter for concern ?
DUMMY2/p301/p301_106.wav|91|I think my game is suited to grass.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_162.wav|66|I'm working on that.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_104.wav|92|Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_354.wav|12|You can leave him, knowing the job will be done.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_027.wav|14|Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.)
DUMMY2/p262/p262_067.wav|45|I was just trying to win the golf tournament.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_212.wav|99|The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_073.wav|53|I saw the story, but that amount wouldn't even pay my commission.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_272.wav|104|For now, they have gone as far as they can.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_098.wav|68|She is on a life support machine.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_150.wav|25|In each case they were a goal down.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_206.wav|67|It wasn't to be.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_355.wav|2|We will be homeless.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_161.wav|79|You can see the appeal of running away.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_026.wav|97|There was a fine line to tread.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_176.wav|100|It is a body blow.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_200.wav|48|It's been a humbling year.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_074.wav|105|It was chaotic.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_360.wav|5|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_266.wav|29|Was everything done to save people ?
DUMMY2/p274/p274_420.wav|32|Hopefully, the answer is in the positive.)
DUMMY2/p283/p283_257.wav|95|We played them off the pitch.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_173.wav|100|This is no reflection on Rangers.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_217.wav|51|That was a disgraceful performance.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_306.wav|105|It should be equal.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_145.wav|46|That alibi is now gone.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_352.wav|1|It didn't help him, as far as we had seen.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_093.wav|83|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_320.wav|49|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_136.wav|103|Each one has its own system.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_196.wav|65|What do they want us to do?)
DUMMY2/p279/p279_401.wav|25|Nobody even knew it had happened.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_131.wav|41|I'm so angry.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_342.wav|27|went on sale.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_121.wav|73|What will happen then?
DUMMY2/p253/p253_397.wav|70|What would be the point?
DUMMY2/p334/p334_365.wav|38|The move follows a review of the Singapore
DUMMY2/p347/p347_242.wav|46|What's the rush?
DUMMY2/p251/p251_197.wav|9|It wasn't to be.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_033.wav|92|Three other people were treated for minor injuries.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_254.wav|77|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_290.wav|100|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_225.wav|36|We're very unhappy about it.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_331.wav|28|He did, and he missed.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_026.wav|45|They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_002.wav|4|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_376.wav|76|She died at her home.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_404.wav|65|It was that kind of match.)
DUMMY2/p259/p259_330.wav|7|No Briton has ever won.)
DUMMY2/p285/p285_264.wav|2|He was also married with two children.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_203.wav|82|No, it's never been mentioned.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_263.wav|43|I would have the hammer in the crowd.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_075.wav|9|Today she has been released.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_053.wav|80|However, he will now have to wait for his chance to impress.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_336.wav|54|That might happen in Pakistan, but in Britain?
DUMMY2/p311/p311_100.wav|4|It is quite a new prescription.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_036.wav|79|We felt it was sufficient.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_132.wav|42|But that's not the idea behind this article.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_404.wav|20|It's an absolute nonsense.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_270.wav|5|We're in shock.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_277.wav|60|I have no further comment to make.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_282.wav|81|He will address the nation this evening.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_323.wav|10|The casting is as perfect.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_280.wav|36|It is also very valuable.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_273.wav|26|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_369.wav|58|The plot is minimal.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_127.wav|11|I am happy to play for Aberdeen.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_092.wav|97|In the event, it proved a largely uplifting experience.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_078.wav|27|Neither it is.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_413.wav|27|The package was expected to be launched within the next three months.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_015.wav|65|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. )
DUMMY2/p310/p310_276.wav|17|There was a battle there.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_194.wav|62|However, we came through.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_263.wav|68|We've had great things in the past.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_169.wav|6|They would never let him go.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_169.wav|33|It is not the message alone.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_085.wav|66|She added, It is a huge problem.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_418.wav|62|However, the report was incorrect.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_087.wav|38|I had a choice, and didn't have to do that.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_131.wav|91|She died in hospital two hours later.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_211.wav|72|I sincerely hope that will not change.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_013.wav|19|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_237.wav|91|Why does she suddenly win everything now?
DUMMY2/p347/p347_097.wav|46|There was no option.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_070.wav|3|This time, it might be for real.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_134.wav|2|If people are genuine, then the problem is not Osama bin Laden.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_315.wav|95|The palace said the Queen was deeply saddened.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_184.wav|74|But that is not an issue for now.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_104.wav|48|I am so proud of him.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_058.wav|77|How are you, sir ?
DUMMY2/p256/p256_188.wav|90|My main concern is that public health is not put at risk.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_371.wav|92|She makes me feel very proud.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_238.wav|94|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_049.wav|39|I didn't think any player was a success on Saturday.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_220.wav|82|Either group is living in fantasy land.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_224.wav|93|Women were mostly notable by their absence.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_369.wav|104|But it would change the context.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_001.wav|52|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_378.wav|66|And it's not funny.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_166.wav|78|At last, in the third year, a letter has arrived.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_103.wav|66|People buy everything with cash.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_202.wav|65|I was independent but I am not now.)
DUMMY2/p330/p330_220.wav|1|Ordering online was very easy.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_356.wav|37|I've been asked that already, this morning - on the radio.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_234.wav|69|It is hard won.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_118.wav|57|Further protests are likely.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_028.wav|2|However, the following year the cancer returned.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_367.wav|2|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_142.wav|88|I'd never have called a doctor for myself.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_352.wav|35|I have a moral dilemma.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_040.wav|103|We know you will not let us down.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_233.wav|30|There is a tunnel after the tunnel.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_258.wav|54|Debate was impassioned and furious.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_076.wav|82|But her parents will never see her again.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_261.wav|0|There will be widespread support on all sides.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_121.wav|65|All music goes into me.)
DUMMY2/p248/p248_051.wav|99|But it might have done.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_157.wav|54|We have all been shocked by her death.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_004.wav|33|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_322.wav|23|The palace said the Queen was deeply saddened.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_142.wav|83|He realises his mistake.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_036.wav|89|Was it worth it?
DUMMY2/p274/p274_203.wav|32|If it doesn't, it doesn't.)
DUMMY2/p323/p323_098.wav|34|They are not suitable.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_030.wav|62|I've got the poster.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_329.wav|22|I played well on Saturday and again today.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_002.wav|43|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_242.wav|90|It would appear that it has not been a problem.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_322.wav|100|Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_077.wav|24|He was a lovely man.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_070.wav|41|The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_127.wav|10|We had another last Tuesday.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_076.wav|39|Even the one she loved.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_176.wav|70|As we worked.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_120.wav|36|Then again, we could have.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_327.wav|69|Two people were interviewed.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_139.wav|10|I love the spectacle of cinema.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_057.wav|26|He was popular.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_288.wav|49|I just want to change my life.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_036.wav|44|Nor does it have a stock of medicines.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_394.wav|75|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_385.wav|68|This is the first stage of catching up.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_383.wav|42|And it's time for new leadership.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_009.wav|21|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_167.wav|96|Waiting times for these services are too long.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_228.wav|52|Royal Bank provided debt funding for the deals.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_195.wav|86|It's the same old story.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_352.wav|77|Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_367.wav|14|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.)
DUMMY2/p288/p288_258.wav|47|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_189.wav|21|She really suffered for her art.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_184.wav|84|Is Saddam a threat ?
DUMMY2/p271/p271_033.wav|27|This is the window.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_028.wav|67|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_045.wav|59|Sure, it's funny.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_071.wav|23|So the challenge is against ourselves.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_235.wav|22|Correction, knowing him, he might.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_354.wav|28|I have also been delighted with Stevie.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_371.wav|79|Well, you don't have time.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_311.wav|4|This is new money.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_026.wav|48|The Government, however, insists the company is not for sale.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_144.wav|10|I have always loved the countryside.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_069.wav|106|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_124.wav|71|"Some of the characters will not be played by humans."
DUMMY2/p345/p345_180.wav|82|They have known the hard times.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_188.wav|82|Everything in the world was focused on London.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_021.wav|51|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_268.wav|81|It's a way of life.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_385.wav|48|Those overseas offices were great.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_056.wav|37|After the match, do you ?
DUMMY2/p360/p360_276.wav|60|They might well be right.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_307.wav|77|There is no evidence for that.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_416.wav|60|It's not an impression.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_253.wav|104|We don't want to be too intrusive.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_079.wav|38|Maybe that was the whole point.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_141.wav|11|Where is the logic in that?
DUMMY2/p278/p278_322.wav|10|The songs are just so good.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_086.wav|11|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_163.wav|64|I was in jail for five years.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_127.wav|88|He was extremely ill.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_016.wav|3|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_068.wav|70|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_111.wav|68|Only the scale of change differed.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_417.wav|32|They've also enjoyed their share of good fortune.)
DUMMY2/p268/p268_219.wav|87|We had to add value.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_087.wav|100|I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_409.wav|55|Five local people were injured.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_169.wav|87|There were no plans for a rights issue.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_262.wav|92|The committees are due to report next year.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_156.wav|36|Are you from the rugby ?
DUMMY2/p246/p246_302.wav|5|She is really magic.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_467.wav|24|This is the stuff of live music.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_419.wav|65|We didn't really have to power up.)
DUMMY2/p279/p279_051.wav|25|Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_196.wav|24|It was a bit like having children.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_043.wav|45|It's a crucial award.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_083.wav|39|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_272.wav|49|He wasn't really doing anything, so he wanted out.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_133.wav|78|Or it would have been.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_202.wav|92|I will be having talks with the workforce.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_139.wav|40|It was very frightened and dirty.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_060.wav|62|We just wish they had done so before.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_233.wav|68|Mr King, who was present at yesterday's hearing, refused to comment.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_396.wav|42|It's not a party, no, no.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_146.wav|83|Who would have?
DUMMY2/p280/p280_318.wav|52|I always felt they played for me.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_104.wav|79|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_235.wav|65|After the match, do you?)
DUMMY2/p253/p253_352.wav|70|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_021.wav|97|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_196.wav|72|I see that any day now.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_220.wav|97|I haven't made the donation yet.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_006.wav|30|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_448.wav|24|The people around me were fantastic.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_040.wav|39|At this stage, we think the air campaign is enough.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_093.wav|97|But they must serve their sentence in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_248.wav|49|I am deeply sorry they did.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_057.wav|44|It was more like a Labour Party rally.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_268.wav|95|And they were being paid ?
DUMMY2/p283/p283_100.wav|95|It really was an unusual award.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_352.wav|45|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_264.wav|1|He will decide tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_374.wav|62|It's such a tragedy.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_191.wav|59|It's like a garage.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_302.wav|26|One was a lawyer.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_011.wav|92|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_090.wav|68|Saddam Hussein has made the case against himself.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_301.wav|95|This is a total mystery.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_311.wav|48|Celtic were the losers then.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_298.wav|53|It is based on population rather than need.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_134.wav|50|You're a gambling man.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_186.wav|67|Is Saddam a threat ?
DUMMY2/p275/p275_243.wav|40|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_055.wav|8|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
DUMMY2/p259/p259_187.wav|7|It is only the beginning.)
DUMMY2/p362/p362_072.wav|15|And it was this one.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_220.wav|96|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_109.wav|49|There will be plenty to keep them occupied.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_046.wav|106|We believe a third party was involved.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_045.wav|24|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
DUMMY2/p311/p311_006.wav|4|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_066.wav|41|In the current outbreak, the reverse is true.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_309.wav|31|Is there on his hands?
DUMMY2/p297/p297_219.wav|42|I'm looking at ways to do that now.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_009.wav|59|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_334.wav|27|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_058.wav|52|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_157.wav|97|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_404.wav|27|They are not left wing.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_026.wav|31|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_090.wav|12|What happens when the funding is exhausted.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_183.wav|13|Progress is being made but it is slow.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_334.wav|73|As, indeed, they would be.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_242.wav|86|In fact, we were all over the shop.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_314.wav|17|Boarding school was equally protective.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_291.wav|83|Nothing is safe.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_311.wav|69|A review is under way.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_146.wav|50|It has become a way of life.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_386.wav|74|It will be a new experience.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_132.wav|75|They could use a boost.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_105.wav|97|His handling raises a wider issue.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_042.wav|29|It will concentrate on the Thames Valley.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_020.wav|87|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_305.wav|64|A hospital spokeswoman described his condition as stable.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_317.wav|56|You are talking about a matter of life and death.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_224.wav|83|I didn't play too well in the third quarter.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_395.wav|46|They have not allowed them to defend themselves.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_073.wav|62|I am still waiting for a reply.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_307.wav|52|It might have led to a screen career, but it didn't.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_314.wav|11|I am not a threat to coaches.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_051.wav|37|And they removed a Borderer.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_236.wav|40|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_320.wav|20|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_342.wav|89|Another case of foot-and-mouth disease was confirmed in Scotland yesterday.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_175.wav|87|There's still plenty time left.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_364.wav|15|Cooking is intricate and complex.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_124.wav|77|We will try to find someone.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_307.wav|74|Now they had it.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_109.wav|16|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_251.wav|20|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_115.wav|93|I'm delighted about that.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_228.wav|63|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_102.wav|84|It is much as it has been described.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_178.wav|16|Four policemen were wounded.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_198.wav|99|It was still there, but right at the end.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_071.wav|58|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_244.wav|70|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_400.wav|82|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_103.wav|107|He is only now regaining his confidence.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_012.wav|76|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_199.wav|94|The conference is the first test.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_274.wav|96|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_088.wav|77|But I know the course.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_261.wav|84|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_348.wav|64|So now you know.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_227.wav|94|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_010.wav|55|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_446.wav|27|That brought a wonderful marriage of bass and soprano.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_361.wav|43|Our numbers are small.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_308.wav|70|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_308.wav|30|The list is too long for this piece.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_452.wav|37|We didn't want any trouble.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_245.wav|64|It's an excellent idea that makes sense.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_225.wav|87|So I got a blood test.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_266.wav|0|On the contrary they stand to gain.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_028.wav|26|They should be so lucky.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_371.wav|72|If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_103.wav|27|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_026.wav|103|This could be one such case, he declared.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_193.wav|42|After that, the Scottish Parliament will run the show.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_029.wav|57|I feel I did not have enough time.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_224.wav|46|You can never tell.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_024.wav|50|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_173.wav|28|Its first awards will do just that.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_263.wav|85|In the meantime, everyone is taking everyone to court.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_383.wav|58|But, clearly, it is crucial to understand that point.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_304.wav|95|It has the potential to be another North Sea.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_111.wav|91|The Labour Party's not downbeat, and neither is the Labour Government.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_066.wav|85|I wouldn't give them a grade.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_168.wav|34|I want my country to be a republic, not an empire.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_096.wav|5|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_414.wav|96|I was very young.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_144.wav|87|He was forced to quit.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_212.wav|19|But there's no eye contact.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_205.wav|41|That is an important part of our role.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_211.wav|93|We'll have to work hard today.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_181.wav|49|Our customers come first.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_015.wav|1|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_166.wav|45|We have a budget in March.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_268.wav|37|The Internet is no substitute for customer service.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_243.wav|58|Sub Not Used, McKay.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_419.wav|64|They were in good humour, too.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_112.wav|62|I believe he could have turned it around.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_364.wav|45|It was a double tragedy for the family.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_050.wav|58|I've just got to do this.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_256.wav|96|A friendship that will endure.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_291.wav|57|Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_204.wav|74|Why does he do it?
DUMMY2/p232/p232_017.wav|96|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_363.wav|7|Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.)
DUMMY2/p294/p294_079.wav|104|Three bystanders were killed.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_308.wav|40|You should be.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_087.wav|20|They lived for their children.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_348.wav|79|And that was the real problem.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_268.wav|22|Racism has no place in any sport.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_005.wav|87|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_129.wav|99|Wish I could be there on Sunday in person but I can't.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_009.wav|97|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_250.wav|31|We have a free vote on these things in our party.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_423.wav|33|I'm going to take it further.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_118.wav|2|She does not want to speak.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_316.wav|103|The time is up for Iraq to comply.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_407.wav|11|We are obviously disturbed by this case.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_062.wav|27|Jobs could go.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_476.wav|65|Tell us about it.)
DUMMY2/p299/p299_215.wav|58|IT was a thoroughly modern affair.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_223.wav|95|I came home by ambulance.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_325.wav|56|It looks as though the issue with The Scotsman is too sensitive.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_347.wav|4|I've no problem with what they said.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_287.wav|38|It's going to be a new challenge.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_316.wav|104|We all make mistakes.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_069.wav|77|That would be too easy.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_160.wav|23|The only answer is a public inquiry.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_371.wav|53|We have been going for three years.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_235.wav|67|The boy is no longer with us.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_410.wav|46|It was a stunning strike.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_037.wav|12|This means that our programme is quite unusual.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_180.wav|71|"I have no sympathy with her at all."
DUMMY2/p311/p311_275.wav|4|He will do very well.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_131.wav|8|What are they for ?
DUMMY2/p244/p244_038.wav|78|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_007.wav|94|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_250.wav|60|It is part of his game.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_151.wav|83|I was stunned.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_284.wav|54|I love you so very much.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_196.wav|31|They are now divorced.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_255.wav|100|That is the consistent approach of the Government.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_380.wav|36|I wanted to go out on a high.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_015.wav|49|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_142.wav|11|I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_108.wav|98|Most people know that.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_118.wav|97|Players were held in equally low regard.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_469.wav|7|It was like someone had died.)
DUMMY2/p333/p333_343.wav|64|He was different from the rest of us.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_135.wav|58|Lord Johnston will give a decision later.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_340.wav|10|Do you think we are a top nation ?
DUMMY2/p299/p299_190.wav|58|This isn't something the Labour Government has invented.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_091.wav|6|We have not given up.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_274.wav|70|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_404.wav|96|This is a huge confidence boost.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_051.wav|97|These men are a part of India.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_253.wav|85|Why do it?
DUMMY2/p301/p301_151.wav|91|I haven't just gone in, done a three-hour rehearsal, and gone.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_240.wav|90|He claimed the government had lost the plot.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_245.wav|20|I should think so, too.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_191.wav|51|They had been together for about three years.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_222.wav|62|The scheme was simple but extremely effective.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_254.wav|80|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_193.wav|80|We want to help them through it.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_329.wav|25|They haven't got a hope.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_358.wav|38|They've got three-quarters of the way.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_137.wav|84|I am now unemployed.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_171.wav|23|At this point we can only speculate.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_290.wav|10|I understand the security issue.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_307.wav|99|It should be equal.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_271.wav|100|Do I think about them often ?
DUMMY2/p316/p316_181.wav|85|But this relative success has not been easy.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_266.wav|22|It was a moment of madness.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_141.wav|79|I'm sure he will be aware of it.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_474.wav|75|He was a shooting star.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_079.wav|25|He had been a singer.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_246.wav|36|We just had a go.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_320.wav|90|It should be equal.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_292.wav|52|Its work includes dealing with child abuse.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_302.wav|94|Sunday's game was not a trial.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_266.wav|2|We are happy.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_200.wav|105|We have an election in eight days.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_021.wav|13|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_299.wav|80|He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_403.wav|54|It is not an abortion.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_204.wav|34|We begin, as ever, with a reminder of the end.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_129.wav|93|I do not think this family will ever get over this.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_197.wav|77|The service from the other players was super.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_396.wav|41|We're looking for justice.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_392.wav|48|So is that it, then ?
DUMMY2/p374/p374_087.wav|11|It would be very dangerous.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_379.wav|82|And therein lies the problem.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_060.wav|68|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_143.wav|56|So, did she meet him ?
DUMMY2/p345/p345_346.wav|82|Spent three months alone at sea.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_097.wav|49|You can expect a hell of a fuss.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_245.wav|24|They all made the European Ryder Cup team.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_347.wav|107|The princess has had other health problems.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_199.wav|33|We want to play at the worlds.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_338.wav|7|Is it worth it ?)
DUMMY2/p276/p276_286.wav|106|Their extinction is not inevitable.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_359.wav|6|They never seem to do anything about it.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_281.wav|62|They were totally behind it.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_392.wav|4|Lothian and Borders police are appealing for witnesses.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_058.wav|21|The matter will come up again.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_182.wav|58|Who is he?
DUMMY2/p275/p275_231.wav|40|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_318.wav|38|Almost the day after the election, the battle lines were drawn.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_136.wav|18|I am not inclined to believe it.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_391.wav|87|This is a load of nonsense.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_143.wav|93|She died at her home.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_269.wav|94|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_079.wav|84|However, he stressed that no decision had yet been made.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_231.wav|13|This action could have been avoided.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_295.wav|42|That idea is rubbish.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_025.wav|72|So we will cut their numbers.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_013.wav|50|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_071.wav|52|It turned me against the whole system.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_083.wav|81|By then, he was walking on water.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_037.wav|53|That was not perfect golf by any means.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_061.wav|32|Only water is currently allowed.)
DUMMY2/p232/p232_239.wav|96|It is set in Paris.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_193.wav|85|It's to do with this place.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_017.wav|11|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_120.wav|44|After about a year, the feeling returned to my finger.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_064.wav|81|I've spent a lot of time on buses.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_027.wav|30|Each one has its own system.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_132.wav|90|Well, you can have a tree.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_375.wav|46|I'm just looking to take my chances.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_137.wav|90|It is also well received.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_378.wav|52|He had got himself into trouble with money and needed money.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_236.wav|93|Jobs could go.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_058.wav|47|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_264.wav|45|At first I thought I was gone.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_053.wav|55|By all accounts he was delighted.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_291.wav|52|He would get into any world team.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_284.wav|94|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_124.wav|22|We all like to see forgiveness and redemption.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_224.wav|10|Twaddle is a case in point.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_307.wav|75|The rescue package is public money.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_083.wav|57|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_200.wav|4|Can you believe it?
DUMMY2/p284/p284_091.wav|16|She is an expert on medical ethics.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_232.wav|106|I never wanted a legal battle.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_053.wav|74|Don't you believe it.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_349.wav|4|I think we have got the balance right.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_146.wav|106|Colin said, You get through the day-to-day by looking at the future.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_232.wav|75|I'm just a regular person.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_413.wav|107|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_113.wav|72|Part of the complex is historic.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_183.wav|91|It has removed a bit of guilt.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_171.wav|82|It is a hobby for me.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_389.wav|26|I was so nervous.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_416.wav|32|A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.)
DUMMY2/p305/p305_009.wav|54|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_348.wav|96|That is the very reason why it was so vital.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_173.wav|105|I feel like my game has come a long way.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_290.wav|58|Are his works inside out?
DUMMY2/p283/p283_161.wav|95|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_209.wav|44|He wins the match with a passionate, committed, almost demented, display.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_324.wav|24|Holland won by five wickets.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_182.wav|75|One season, they might do well.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_067.wav|100|That's not the intention at all.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_462.wav|63|The peace process will be buried!
DUMMY2/p227/p227_393.wav|29|You have to rely on each other.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_296.wav|76|Is being naturally funny enough?
DUMMY2/p229/p229_392.wav|67|Yet the data is compelling.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_157.wav|47|I have got a wife to feed.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_009.wav|62|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_415.wav|76|But that night they killed her housekeeper.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_120.wav|11|That's not going to happen again.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_397.wav|0|I remain a buyer of the shares.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_205.wav|48|The refund is fully justified.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_118.wav|60|He played it like a veteran.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_099.wav|26|Now, though, he believes that the new formation has helped his form.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_113.wav|77|There were no grounds for his action.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_217.wav|36|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_208.wav|69|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_182.wav|55|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_426.wav|8|It needs to be volatile.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_285.wav|63|These figures are truly terrible.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_267.wav|94|The warning is timely.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_183.wav|47|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_350.wav|33|It will make a big difference.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_018.wav|43|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_099.wav|59|They had to be cut from the wreckage.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_168.wav|18|I would like to make an impact, of course.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_006.wav|83|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_070.wav|43|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_089.wav|90|It's never too late.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_001.wav|63|Please call Stella.

DUMMY2/p226/p226_303.wav|43|One was a lawyer.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_259.wav|40|Blood samples were taken.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_405.wav|14|The Cabinet is split over the issue.)
DUMMY2/p316/p316_166.wav|85|It certainly sounded it at times.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_270.wav|24|It was a kind of contempt.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_257.wav|92|Controllers major concern is safety.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_069.wav|50|We need to increase the membership.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_275.wav|66|I didn't have a trio.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_029.wav|48|There isn't the seriousness of other businesses.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_059.wav|101|But retail banking would be run from Halifax.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_258.wav|85|Hopefully today will be the turning point.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_134.wav|44|We have big ideas.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_285.wav|60|These things happen in football but shouldn't.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_261.wav|32|You can feel at home in China.)
DUMMY2/p314/p314_336.wav|51|Moving from Manchester to London was upheaval enough.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_209.wav|62|Of course he was right!
DUMMY2/p298/p298_053.wav|68|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_163.wav|6|I live for today.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_270.wav|34|What do you think of the hair?
DUMMY2/p293/p293_334.wav|23|For his opposite number, this was a just triumph.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_044.wav|14|Merger would be entirely logical.)
DUMMY2/p300/p300_253.wav|102|A management agreement, however, was conceded.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_141.wav|9|Three penalties were given.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_037.wav|107|We used to keep our business rates.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_246.wav|0|It is a court case.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_128.wav|26|Wish I could be there on Sunday in person but I can't.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_083.wav|51|I, like many others, will consider where we go from here.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_062.wav|11|This year the exercise is being repeated.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_196.wav|87|Everyone around the club was supportive.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_093.wav|22|Three other people were treated for minor injuries.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_210.wav|26|Tenants will be unable to defend themselves.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_015.wav|100|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_412.wav|7|It sounds like a wish list.)
DUMMY2/p266/p266_092.wav|20|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_185.wav|21|Of course, there was still much to be done.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_050.wav|52|Have I really come to this ?
DUMMY2/p236/p236_272.wav|75|The capital costs are modest.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_349.wav|87|Friends said he had suffered a blackout two weeks ago.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_187.wav|79|It's not long enough.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_006.wav|24|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_157.wav|85|I understood that concern.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_407.wav|55|The doctors are quite positive about my progress.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_163.wav|9|However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_125.wav|47|I had relied on him.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_466.wav|32|Phil Mickelson did that last year.)
DUMMY2/p269/p269_042.wav|94|I was scared.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_386.wav|27|Who will provide the wine?
DUMMY2/p341/p341_133.wav|66|There was no hint of bravado.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_301.wav|107|Shaking his head, Mr Cook said he simply couldn't understand it.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_137.wav|32|It's going to take some time.)
DUMMY2/p273/p273_008.wav|56|These take the shape of a long round arch, and its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_029.wav|37|Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_266.wav|79|Nobody is pushing out to the right.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_015.wav|73|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_272.wav|30|I'm not sure how they got there, but they are.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_006.wav|62|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_237.wav|16|You can feel at home in China.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_097.wav|32|The following are the principal provisions.)
DUMMY2/p229/p229_063.wav|67|I've spent a lot of time on buses.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_037.wav|11|He didn't want me to leave the house.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_363.wav|40|He's been in a nursing home for two years.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_040.wav|94|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_283.wav|10|The merger was welcomed by Tony Blair.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_129.wav|73|It seems so long since I did the exams.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_394.wav|48|His leader wanted to celebrate.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_326.wav|50|That decision will be made over the next couple of days.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_447.wav|14|That will be best for him.)
DUMMY2/p249/p249_081.wav|80|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_097.wav|34|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_288.wav|6|The Believer isn't just a movie.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_079.wav|45|All options are open.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_410.wav|7|The team hadn't been picked.)
DUMMY2/p351/p351_376.wav|33|But what lies ahead?
DUMMY2/p312/p312_129.wav|62|His remit is specific.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_026.wav|12|This is not a floating Las Vegas.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_317.wav|11|I was very pleased with them today, though.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_404.wav|70|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_110.wav|50|You'd better believe it.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_107.wav|24|The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_414.wav|42|However, many of their victories have been close affairs.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_012.wav|93|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_230.wav|24|My daughter is an adult.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_198.wav|17|She is, however, fully conscious and able to speak.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_183.wav|54|We are expected to do better than before.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_085.wav|30|Not everyone, however, was pleased with the proposed changes.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_230.wav|103|Several hundred people attended yesterday.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_167.wav|40|These days are long gone.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_426.wav|105|Mary Archer is almost too clever.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_275.wav|59|You've got to have both sides.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_150.wav|77|We have a budget in March.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_167.wav|16|Does that put pressure on us?
DUMMY2/p233/p233_279.wav|84|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_249.wav|18|There is a great carry over value.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_118.wav|69|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_066.wav|65|She always put the party first.)
DUMMY2/p227/p227_124.wav|29|And does it ?
DUMMY2/p318/p318_374.wav|19|I am a little bit tired.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_242.wav|43|It's only fair.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_273.wav|46|Life, as many people know it, in other words.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_133.wav|69|The BBC was a disgrace.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_302.wav|82|It's a gigantic con.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_193.wav|69|Tommy is not a problem.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_345.wav|26|Nobody else was with me.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_270.wav|95|What was the matter for concern ?
DUMMY2/p236/p236_030.wav|75|And we have a singer.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_457.wav|7|He confirmed the coaching structure was already under review.)
DUMMY2/p236/p236_176.wav|75|Is there a waiting list ?
DUMMY2/p340/p340_094.wav|74|I'm delighted to be coming back home.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_068.wav|93|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_270.wav|53|Its primary business channel is the internet.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_206.wav|78|We can take the city.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_206.wav|55|There remains some Scottish influence, however.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_118.wav|61|On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_249.wav|90|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_090.wav|6|But someone has got to do it.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_399.wav|74|I reported it but nothing was done.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_396.wav|24|The marshall at the turn was great.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_248.wav|47|He said he was impressed by the set-up at Celtic.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_008.wav|24|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_153.wav|42|That's my big challenge.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_009.wav|27|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_181.wav|6|He can do everything.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_306.wav|106|They are determined to make a meaningful contribution.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_185.wav|43|It is not fair.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_458.wav|65|The technology looks excellent.)
DUMMY2/p363/p363_368.wav|6|We have a business to run.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_336.wav|72|Yes, it was too short a night.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_287.wav|48|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_184.wav|107|No, it's actually in a block of flats.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_039.wav|22|There's always a solution, somewhere you can meet in the middle.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_009.wav|84|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_254.wav|17|We've got no plans with regard to recording, but who knows?
DUMMY2/p305/p305_242.wav|54|They were not doing it too well, either.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_187.wav|4|Another man said, It was horrible.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_199.wav|22|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_032.wav|34|Leisure centres were also affected.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_463.wav|89|The consultants report commissioned by the previous Government was not published.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_134.wav|11|They are a good team.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_199.wav|25|There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_073.wav|78|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_286.wav|94|If not, he should go home.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_183.wav|12|This one was my best chance.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_232.wav|8|There was the option of following the Celtic to Portugal.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_145.wav|26|The FBI could become involved.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_271.wav|59|She looked so young.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_278.wav|105|It is a vote of confidence in the skills in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_343.wav|75|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_303.wav|22|Either group is living in fantasy land.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_052.wav|52|We took part in a festival called Global Dance.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_086.wav|0|They need to find a form of words.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_054.wav|11|But the cost to his health was enormous.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_141.wav|80|It's a question of fashion.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_077.wav|3|Last night, the move was bitterly denounced by France Telecom.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_121.wav|106|I am not very pleased.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_375.wav|84|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_156.wav|72|The tournament has now been cancelled.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_070.wav|31|Then followed a bout of flu.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_021.wav|105|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_222.wav|39|The defender should have won the bloody ba.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_056.wav|41|That time has passed.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_331.wav|56|The airport was even different.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_035.wav|76|We are doing very well as we are.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_107.wav|47|They were behind the wheel.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_414.wav|103|He was not seeking special advantage.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_236.wav|10|Women were mostly notable by their absence.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_157.wav|89|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
