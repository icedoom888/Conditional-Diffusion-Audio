DUMMY2/p271/p271_172.wav|27|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_041.wav|21|We were with him the whole time.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_276.wav|98|I should think so, too.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_057.wav|27|I love the Dome.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_312.wav|85|It's a lovely, lovely film.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_277.wav|29|I can't get a job.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_092.wav|25|They lived for their children.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_255.wav|81|Is that a serious question?
DUMMY2/p307/p307_277.wav|22|Little Voice is on general release.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_120.wav|88|Who will take them after that?
DUMMY2/p288/p288_166.wav|47|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_237.wav|96|However, no further action was taken by police.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_115.wav|37|It's very bad timing, but it's happened.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_170.wav|87|I can see it now.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_337.wav|81|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_347.wav|68|On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_177.wav|55|I'd rather be in our position than Rangers.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_164.wav|49|I'm very surprised and obviously delighted.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_312.wav|24|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_333.wav|97|Everything is obviously in the very early stages.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_167.wav|71|"By then, however, both men were already in the US."
DUMMY2/p260/p260_292.wav|81|The songs are just so good.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_292.wav|31|These figures are truly awful.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_399.wav|33|Where does it come from?
DUMMY2/p299/p299_196.wav|58|Darrell was, however, adamant.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_089.wav|69|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
DUMMY2/p360/p360_038.wav|60|I had to be into it.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_219.wav|81|I didn't play too well in the third quarter.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_159.wav|52|As our national coach, Brown is done for.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_301.wav|66|Eating was a nightmare, and it wasn't possible to sleep.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_070.wav|101|That is bound to happen.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_143.wav|106|Absences should be carefully monitored.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_002.wav|17|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_326.wav|45|He said she was mad.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_016.wav|96|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_100.wav|23|You do have a way out.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_359.wav|91|It won't happen overnight, but things will get better.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_218.wav|96|He seemed to lose his focus.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_018.wav|100|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_111.wav|72|We will meet again.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_039.wav|27|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_125.wav|6|This is not a problem.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_335.wav|8|The Premier League has been a huge success.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_298.wav|26|The home was now under new management.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_058.wav|12|Mr Cook, a left-winger from Britain, would be ideally replaced.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_278.wav|81|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_303.wav|56|His appeal is instantly understood.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_284.wav|78|It is important that he is involved.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_269.wav|85|This is a good move for me.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_320.wav|27|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_328.wav|60|He refused to name the survivors.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_383.wav|64|Is that where we are?
DUMMY2/p343/p343_374.wav|21|He is lying to save his skin.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_246.wav|59|Her presence was almost everywhere.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_298.wav|97|Was all this really just five months ago?
DUMMY2/p299/p299_164.wav|58|This is a huge confidence boost.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_248.wav|77|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_303.wav|104|And this tournament will travel.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_051.wav|67|It is difficult for Ali.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_450.wav|65|We are unable to provide support for future issues.)
DUMMY2/p317/p317_101.wav|97|This championship is different from the other majors.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_150.wav|1|It is, in other words, Entrapment by another name.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_063.wav|75|I was as strong as a horse.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_189.wav|58|There was no rescue.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_249.wav|84|It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_127.wav|13|But the killer remains at large.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_052.wav|100|It is on the news.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_424.wav|46|Is this accurate?
DUMMY2/p247/p247_108.wav|14|We made a world record together.)
DUMMY2/p238/p238_040.wav|37|I remember that day well.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_208.wav|9|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_324.wav|93|Craig is a major concern for us.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_397.wav|14|They have not done so this season so far.)
DUMMY2/p362/p362_359.wav|15|That is very hard, alone.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_186.wav|77|It was a pre-emptive strike.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_115.wav|43|I did not think about the Ryder Cup.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_121.wav|48|The error appeared in a warrant.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_104.wav|17|He wouldn't allow that to happen.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_161.wav|5|It is not like us.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_066.wav|43|Art is extra.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_196.wav|17|I will wait until later.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_235.wav|73|Hospitals and school building will go ahead.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_271.wav|66|And we still have to pay his salary.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_369.wav|31|I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_398.wav|4|Who can say?
DUMMY2/p294/p294_360.wav|104|The trial continues today.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_329.wav|57|The train was on time.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_109.wav|90|But they did not even get a reply to their letter.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_222.wav|60|It's a creative energy.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_099.wav|51|Why does she suddenly win everything now?
DUMMY2/p333/p333_229.wav|64|Our job is to change that.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_281.wav|2|He will address the nation this evening.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_359.wav|3|There's still a bit to go.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_031.wav|90|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_466.wav|75|The boys are mentally focused.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_272.wav|64|That's a very strong element.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_414.wav|100|It is good for Europe.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_289.wav|45|This is a national crisis.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_318.wav|77|This is a war over our home.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_331.wav|23|He is in charge on the pitch.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_289.wav|10|Those overseas offices were great.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_068.wav|80|I've spent a lot of time on buses.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_222.wav|2|Clearly, the stakes are high.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_047.wav|20|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_319.wav|96|For the moment, our position remains the same.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_157.wav|60|Conditions were very difficult for the players.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_198.wav|104|O Leary was clearly disgusted.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_222.wav|1|However, Sharon rejected the claims.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_106.wav|63|We will deal with the refugees.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_023.wav|26|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_134.wav|22|No-one, however, was complacent about the size of the task.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_322.wav|97|There is no right to appeal.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_115.wav|23|The door is open.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_384.wav|28|The distinction is also supported by doctors.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_351.wav|105|I am not willing to say anything about any couple.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_193.wav|33|This was an hour before the show.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_200.wav|60|The atmosphere in the dressing room is superb.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_226.wav|18|The signs are positive.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_085.wav|71|"Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today."
DUMMY2/p376/p376_242.wav|71|"I have a lot of relatives in this part of the country."
DUMMY2/p259/p259_009.wav|7|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. )
DUMMY2/p253/p253_016.wav|70|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_005.wav|55|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_069.wav|79|He said it was for sale.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_072.wav|103|Partly, but only partly, this is their own fault.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_093.wav|51|Action must be taken urgently.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_334.wav|7|Do they think anyone else wants them ?)
DUMMY2/p268/p268_194.wav|87|Lee Westwood has other ideas.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_260.wav|60|We couldn't believe it at first.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_116.wav|36|Such actions are rarely popular.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_055.wav|10|We have not given up hope.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_367.wav|19|The hearing in Edinburgh continues.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_079.wav|21|I am looking forward to getting home.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_408.wav|104|If you could find it.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_230.wav|71|"It's very safe."
DUMMY2/p374/p374_147.wav|11|Raymond was always on the outside.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_186.wav|61|The hotel was now for sale.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_216.wav|2|Because they didn't want to know.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_259.wav|46|Staff should be paid for what they produce.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_186.wav|82|You have a plan?
DUMMY2/p292/p292_064.wav|13|You can see how he made his money.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_112.wav|45|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_061.wav|5|It's that kind of place.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_081.wav|28|The property is owned by Glasgow City Council.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_215.wav|49|Asylum is an entirely different issue to race.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_199.wav|41|Today was first class.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_346.wav|9|In Scotland, we keep the faith.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_225.wav|21|That's the only thing that matters.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_338.wav|75|The game is now open.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_295.wav|11|I had a sense of deja vu.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_146.wav|85|In the current outbreak, the reverse is true.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_055.wav|63|Do I have a favourite ?
DUMMY2/p323/p323_338.wav|34|We work on the same level.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_238.wav|73|We will need to study the report before any decision is taken.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_206.wav|11|They have to be dealt with.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_083.wav|92|I had found my vision.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_319.wav|9|He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_227.wav|58|They have admitted they cannot meet that outlay.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_118.wav|0|We did what we had to do.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_110.wav|99|It had been played at festivals.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_265.wav|82|That will not change.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_024.wav|57|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_282.wav|83|She is an expert on medical ethics.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_187.wav|78|It is difficult to say.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_320.wav|86|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_294.wav|95|I told you I was ill.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_169.wav|12|Who do these people think they are?
DUMMY2/p293/p293_381.wav|23|When he took over it really took off.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_391.wav|46|There was no energy behind it.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_014.wav|35|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_218.wav|33|The problem is worse in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_198.wav|102|Both of them have looked good.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_164.wav|47|And I was happy for the happiness of my brothers.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_139.wav|20|I don't know the full story.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_250.wav|84|There wasn't a goal.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_264.wav|20|You take a risk.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_178.wav|80|The release attracted little attention.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_233.wav|49|We are ready for the long haul.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_414.wav|19|We never agreed to it.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_319.wav|48|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_381.wav|94|It is a large number.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_138.wav|104|Above all, the approach is upbeat.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_106.wav|5|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_467.wav|95|It all began as an accident.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_406.wav|106|David Murray, the Rangers chairman, also welcomed the scheme.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_267.wav|75|The calls were last night rejected by the US and the UK.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_058.wav|98|This ruling is a farce.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_103.wav|4|These matters are now behind us.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_048.wav|107|What's it got to do with art?
DUMMY2/p257/p257_413.wav|105|We are delighted with this outcome.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_298.wav|101|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_116.wav|90|This is a step backwards.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_041.wav|87|Do I have a favourite ?
DUMMY2/p317/p317_398.wav|97|He takes his time, and won't be rushed.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_062.wav|40|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_407.wav|4|We have reacted well to each other.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_293.wav|82|Somebody has to speak up for common sense.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_336.wav|75|That decision has already been made.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_014.wav|42|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_028.wav|5|However, the following year the cancer returned.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_246.wav|65|It is based on population rather than need.)
DUMMY2/p335/p335_030.wav|49|They tend to be easily influenced by others.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_153.wav|24|She died at her home.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_050.wav|46|And does it even matter?
DUMMY2/p285/p285_263.wav|2|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_243.wav|83|My son was too young to die.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_310.wav|95|My whole life has changed.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_285.wav|87|Says the Duke of York.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_166.wav|9|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_347.wav|79|This is still happening in the US.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_229.wav|6|Well, we know now.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_227.wav|39|Abbey National is an option.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_134.wav|16|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_303.wav|33|He then did just that.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_422.wav|49|We are encouraged by the news.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_330.wav|50|I am not sure about the rate of progress.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_232.wav|13|I watched a game.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_321.wav|45|We are a peaceful people.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_027.wav|48|And so was a photograph.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_377.wav|79|What do we have to do?
DUMMY2/p262/p262_163.wav|45|It's that sort of night.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_409.wav|14|The idea was first mooted a year ago.)
DUMMY2/p268/p268_031.wav|87|Carlton also declined to comment last night.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_343.wav|56|I have a moral dilemma.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_126.wav|85|You can see the appeal of running away.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_115.wav|70|It was the eighties.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_021.wav|8|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_303.wav|45|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_063.wav|61|It's a real challenge.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_044.wav|24|I made a terrible start.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_132.wav|56|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_169.wav|98|He is married with three children.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_087.wav|86|Global Scotland will be held at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_208.wav|14|This will take several weeks.)
DUMMY2/p317/p317_184.wav|97|The police were called in.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_112.wav|10|They almost achieved a draw.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_049.wav|47|I was lost.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_146.wav|30|The women were on their way home yesterday.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_338.wav|86|The train was on time.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_367.wav|99|Well, the big day has arrived.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_184.wav|3|They were not seeking the right to strike.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_055.wav|33|There was mystery back then.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_307.wav|91|Another casualty yesterday was John Prescott.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_053.wav|31|Because we do not need it.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_331.wav|106|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_334.wav|9|That's the law of the land.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_271.wav|32|He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen.)
DUMMY2/p363/p363_305.wav|6|There will have to be a full inquiry.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_109.wav|12|There are some new buildings in there.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_375.wav|34|But the fans deserve to know!
DUMMY2/p239/p239_059.wav|48|That's been the difference between the sides.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_345.wav|20|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_134.wav|89|This tour is critical for New Zealand rugby.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_120.wav|51|That's not fair to the supporters.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_447.wav|50|We've got a good management record.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_028.wav|6|The proposals were not new.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_413.wav|62|He will never walk the streets again.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_347.wav|58|The science is well known, the solution is simple.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_253.wav|9|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_398.wav|66|We've still got a say in this.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_336.wav|39|The result was a crisis for the global financial system.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_234.wav|27|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_220.wav|107|Appointed general secretary last September.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_217.wav|61|He is slightly confused.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_176.wav|34|O Leary was clearly disgusted.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_055.wav|84|I've never been one for complaining about the press.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_288.wav|32|They can leave at any time.)
DUMMY2/p230/p230_305.wav|35|You have to see it like this.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_251.wav|67|Chambers said he would accept the place.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_176.wav|36|You've got to be vigilant.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_032.wav|89|He was jailed for five years.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_222.wav|44|She has now been registered as disabled.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_035.wav|22|It also makes for interesting viewing.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_158.wav|32|Scotland came very close in the second Test.)
DUMMY2/p269/p269_019.wav|94|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_403.wav|13|I knew she was going to win.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_286.wav|72|I played badly, but it happens.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_156.wav|81|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_196.wav|44|I don't know exactly what happened.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_206.wav|69|In each case they were a goal down.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_146.wav|25|It is like a football team.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_266.wav|107|It is a time bomb.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_465.wav|95|The move is considered a major breakthrough.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_021.wav|94|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drop increases.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_151.wav|6|They will not be going back.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_055.wav|71|"We were surprised to see the photograph."
DUMMY2/p310/p310_372.wav|17|In fact it isn't related to either.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_394.wav|11|Well, you can have a tree.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_134.wav|5|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_181.wav|52|Traffic was also heavy around Strathclyde Park.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_248.wav|88|It was something special.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_108.wav|67|I didn't play well last year.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_313.wav|30|To all intents and purposes, he ran the show.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_073.wav|102|The Prime Minister was very honest and sincere.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_119.wav|39|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_002.wav|72|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_083.wav|31|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_066.wav|37|It's the performance we want.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_041.wav|89|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_185.wav|84|I feel like my game has come a long way.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_360.wav|42|The board is currently resolving its differences.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_393.wav|54|For some, it was more painful than others.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_027.wav|60|Is that it?
DUMMY2/p236/p236_220.wav|75|You are a great player.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_382.wav|55|He said he had now written to Scottish Industry Minister Lord Macdonald.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_129.wav|31|If not, a deal could take many months.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_209.wav|66|John Reid, the Scottish secretary, also welcomed the news.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_031.wav|37|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_036.wav|8|He really is a lovely man.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_156.wav|22|But you can't have it both ways.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_355.wav|57|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_389.wav|22|The wealth of talent in Australia is awesome.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_167.wav|19|It will not be easy for him.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_403.wav|75|I will be able to say in a couple of weeks.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_123.wav|40|That's all right then.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_085.wav|24|They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_464.wav|14|I'm very passionate about my country.)
DUMMY2/p277/p277_236.wav|89|The scene is about this?
DUMMY2/p239/p239_492.wav|48|MOVIE stars are public property.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_020.wav|61|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_105.wav|63|The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_356.wav|27|We will be homeless.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_238.wav|27|They tried to give her advice.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_309.wav|51|He said he was sorry.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_150.wav|12|Again and again, at every level, he delivered the goods.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_313.wav|83|We are in the end game.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_368.wav|76|He suffered a broken back and other injuries.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_423.wav|92|The document is a starting point for discussion.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_116.wav|96|Maybe this battle has been.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_031.wav|45|I expected these kind of questions.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_264.wav|38|Strathclyde Police yesterday declined to comment on Ferris.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_135.wav|9|Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_177.wav|34|What do they do, anyway?
DUMMY2/p360/p360_071.wav|60|What happens next?
DUMMY2/p260/p260_173.wav|81|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_162.wav|5|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_205.wav|51|Do you come from Moscow?
DUMMY2/p258/p258_320.wav|26|My body is clearly capable.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_165.wav|33|It is not an escape.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_057.wav|68|It was more like a Labour Party rally.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_057.wav|24|I expect a rapid response.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_214.wav|23|The replacements made a big difference.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_208.wav|80|He has a lot of experience as a captain in his career.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_257.wav|59|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_401.wav|72|We need to tighten up.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_146.wav|7|What do we want to do that for ?)
DUMMY2/p273/p273_367.wav|56|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_172.wav|37|We continue to hold the shares.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_097.wav|75|That time is not now, however.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_365.wav|0|This is a major championship.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_169.wav|24|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_424.wav|104|He died at the hands of his captors.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_259.wav|13|I wouldn't have had the abandon.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_019.wav|35|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_305.wav|91|That it is a brand name.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_331.wav|46|I am not changing my event.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_125.wav|87|McPherson came from United Biscuits.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_135.wav|95|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_368.wav|85|It wasn't an easy decision.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_349.wav|106|You have caught a serial killer.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_180.wav|14|They could not match it.)
DUMMY2/p307/p307_173.wav|22|Our young people are leaving.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_105.wav|54|T, Is there anything in the wound?
DUMMY2/p279/p279_323.wav|25|They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_223.wav|27|We could easily be cut again.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_414.wav|34|Now it's all written down.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_407.wav|64|However, there are signs of dissent among his collies.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_056.wav|9|Already, he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_222.wav|55|Good records have also been recognised by successful farmers.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_092.wav|44|These things are important for clubs like ourselves.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_106.wav|69|Our position remains unchanged.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_199.wav|31|However, this idea is never developed.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_113.wav|0|What do we do ?
DUMMY2/p275/p275_169.wav|40|We've all had the shots.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_388.wav|28|That is difficult to answer.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_136.wav|91|I would ask the fans to be patient.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_071.wav|20|Neither it is.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_012.wav|67|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_294.wav|78|We are in a war.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_158.wav|31|The first victory made a huge difference to my career.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_173.wav|23|I am very shocked.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_197.wav|69|It was worth a photograph.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_403.wav|33|Britain hasn't seen it in this way.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_191.wav|55|She really suffered for her art.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_351.wav|2|The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_017.wav|99|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_268.wav|65|I may play with two players up, maybe not.)
DUMMY2/p274/p274_252.wav|32|Did it work ?)
DUMMY2/p323/p323_148.wav|34|Substantial pockets of resistance remain.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_181.wav|59|But we are not immune to the problem.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_115.wav|30|The move is considered a major breakthrough.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_026.wav|55|This would include insurance.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_183.wav|58|Serb forces then opened fire in their direction.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_192.wav|37|The Yugoslav army will still be there.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_139.wav|69|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_331.wav|24|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_142.wav|16|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_131.wav|82|It certainly should not be used too often.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_194.wav|52|Murray spent the early part of his career elsewhere.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_190.wav|69|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_187.wav|88|The matter has been reported to the police.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_057.wav|88|Partly, it is his own fault.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_129.wav|102|Does a firefighter have to be killed?
DUMMY2/p313/p313_187.wav|76|Her daughter is getting married.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_232.wav|94|My neighbours are horrified.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_070.wav|11|She could easily have been killed.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_057.wav|90|There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_081.wav|103|I was there for five hours.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_063.wav|53|There were no details of the other five victims.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_056.wav|91|No, it wasn't supposed to do that, officials admitted.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_046.wav|38|No meaningful response was issued.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_323.wav|79|Not that he was complaining.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_376.wav|58|We have been working together for some years.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_140.wav|35|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_114.wav|99|It's not a new concept in jazz.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_302.wav|19|I can feel the sound inside.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_103.wav|58|He had a heart problem.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_014.wav|21|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_346.wav|42|It was blown out of proportion.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_354.wav|96|It is long gone.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_094.wav|73|They tried to deny it.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_045.wav|92|Everything is possible in football.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_176.wav|32|Says the Duke of York.)
DUMMY2/p317/p317_203.wav|97|Mr Smith was dismissive.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_157.wav|78|It is the latter which has prompted the warning.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_052.wav|92|Broadcasting will be top of the agenda.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_283.wav|55|It is a dangerous sport.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_282.wav|68|She had been sexually assaulted.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_086.wav|44|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_312.wav|11|There was a hell of a row.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_314.wav|80|Special measures were needed.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_399.wav|17|The issue has still to be resolved.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_020.wav|73|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_215.wav|86|We want to keep the pound.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_206.wav|52|He is particularly happy with the size of the gallery.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_103.wav|1|An internal inquiry was launched into the procedures.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_235.wav|101|I always felt that I was in control of the match.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_082.wav|68|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_086.wav|61|It's never too late.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_267.wav|3|We can certainly build on this.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_369.wav|32|I got a yellow card.)
DUMMY2/p282/p282_172.wav|83|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_323.wav|50|However, Walker remains determined to fight the proposals.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_241.wav|14|She was an only child.)
DUMMY2/p313/p313_144.wav|76|They played it like a cup final.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_272.wav|44|Sergio was talking his chances down yesterday.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_081.wav|49|That would be dangerous.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_303.wav|21|It is a real concern.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_144.wav|84|I saw some terrible things.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_198.wav|66|Why does she suddenly win everything now?
DUMMY2/p241/p241_222.wav|86|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_047.wav|85|It doesn't have to be in Inverness.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_228.wav|42|I will let you in on a secret.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_396.wav|0|I watch the other visitors.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_073.wav|67|It was chaotic.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_312.wav|73|Is that an issue?
DUMMY2/p261/p261_084.wav|100|Potions said he would drive.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_013.wav|64|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_181.wav|69|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_320.wav|16|Such actions are rarely popular.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_045.wav|32|I had come back from London.)
DUMMY2/p282/p282_058.wav|83|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_203.wav|13|It has affected me.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_161.wav|48|Scottish Enterprise and the banks have been very supportive.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_229.wav|60|Labour will almost certainly remain in control.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_034.wav|76|That is impressive by any standards.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_132.wav|45|We need to chat.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_375.wav|102|We were very happy with our results, which were excellent.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_172.wav|36|They could not match it.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_332.wav|24|We believe the world has too many refugees already.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_334.wav|51|Scotland were beaten again.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_033.wav|6|He gave no other details.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_219.wav|52|Scotland will not vote for New Labour next time.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_426.wav|63|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_154.wav|2|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_004.wav|85|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_263.wav|83|He was also married with two children.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_399.wav|55|It was too difficult.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_173.wav|70|In a way he was.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_128.wav|23|Saddam Hussein has made the case against himself.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_421.wav|27|The service from the other players was super.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_019.wav|49|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_390.wav|58|And the funny thing is, they usually do.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_209.wav|106|It is quite a thing to watch.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_191.wav|48|That is an entirely unacceptable position.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_344.wav|72|What do we do for an encore?
DUMMY2/p314/p314_212.wav|51|But he was a full, working member of our staff.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_416.wav|16|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_349.wav|68|I don't think the Saudis will lay down.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_324.wav|40|My view has now completely changed.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_339.wav|62|He had a horror.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_058.wav|35|It was exactly four months away.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_073.wav|54|I've put my own money into this project.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_259.wav|86|That's the only thing I will say.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_280.wav|58|We need to be looking to the future.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_009.wav|75|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_304.wav|97|I shouldn't have to put up with it.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_047.wav|1|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_175.wav|23|When will this change?
DUMMY2/p314/p314_307.wav|51|He's been here on numerous occasions.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_242.wav|17|My preference is for the single vaccines.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_044.wav|77|I had come back from London.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_047.wav|25|That period was a struggle.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_055.wav|95|I was inspired by two things.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_084.wav|29|Potions said he would drive.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_415.wav|96|We have just got to keep his feet on the ground.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_422.wav|8|Such an attack is bizarre.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_361.wav|72|I've had a hard time, to be honest.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_046.wav|95|I was released after six days.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_209.wav|26|She should not be blamed.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_207.wav|20|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_091.wav|25|Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_343.wav|6|Therefore there is a threat.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_343.wav|27|Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_062.wav|36|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_051.wav|104|Hopefully, that'll come from someone on our side.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_146.wav|68|What was going through her mind that day, that night?
DUMMY2/p277/p277_193.wav|89|Tommy is not a problem.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_066.wav|24|We will pay their bills.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_343.wav|99|It is horrible.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_073.wav|30|That alibi is now gone.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_277.wav|3|That would be a danger.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_144.wav|18|He was part of the family.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_172.wav|46|Yesterday, one, from Aberdeen, was postponed.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_401.wav|39|He's in his element and the audience is delighted by him.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_238.wav|79|Neil is never going to come back.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_154.wav|94|It's like a football team.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_168.wav|67|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_175.wav|74|It was very close.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_266.wav|76|I had trouble with the producers.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_003.wav|29|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_256.wav|6|All winners should be tested.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_268.wav|89|The record companies have gone through the floor.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_242.wav|25|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_182.wav|69|What has caused the demise of singing?
DUMMY2/p329/p329_372.wav|103|The Foreign Office was conspicuous by its absence.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_064.wav|102|Robin Williams is very subdued.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_123.wav|6|Motorists will welcome this.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_173.wav|3|Three hours later, the man was free.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_301.wav|23|But they will not be compelled to join.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_052.wav|60|That's a concern to me.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_116.wav|88|It's an old story.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_096.wav|23|But the cost to his health was enormous.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_422.wav|7|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.)
DUMMY2/p305/p305_098.wav|54|Are they control freaks?
DUMMY2/p258/p258_203.wav|26|It's a mixture of everything.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_116.wav|81|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_345.wav|1|Hopefully we can use this as a platform.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_321.wav|40|Our message was inclusive.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_162.wav|12|Laura is an investment banker.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_184.wav|5|There is no openness.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_100.wav|93|We have every respect for Michelle.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_114.wav|102|I didn't realise it had reached that stage.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_116.wav|49|We kept going right to the final whistle.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_197.wav|57|The procedure is the same in all cases.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_123.wav|27|Who would have?
DUMMY2/p363/p363_198.wav|6|I don't think it's the area.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_321.wav|54|I know the worry over Iraq.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_399.wav|35|That investment has now been secured.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_213.wav|21|His appointment was generally welcomed yesterday.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_281.wav|15|It takes a bit of working out.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_175.wav|68|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_094.wav|34|He was not able to talk to us.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_149.wav|26|The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_268.wav|77|It is a crisis of human rights, a crisis of leadership.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_037.wav|97|Her mother said she fell off a swing.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_345.wav|65|I believe they are dead.)
DUMMY2/p230/p230_185.wav|35|Our destiny is in our own hands.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_258.wav|31|I can't get a job.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_102.wav|0|Such actions are rarely popular.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_053.wav|75|We keep an eye on it.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_205.wav|19|So she told him.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_202.wav|68|I am not a happy man.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_170.wav|50|We've made a couple of albums.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_103.wav|73|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_053.wav|88|I can live with that.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_011.wav|105|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_246.wav|17|And thought we would get away with it.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_149.wav|48|I was given no instructions by no-one.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_066.wav|47|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
DUMMY2/p239/p239_258.wav|48|ADVENTURE is the champagne of life.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_123.wav|31|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_067.wav|22|I want my country to be a republic, not an empire.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_390.wav|54|The package has been properly costed.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_161.wav|104|There is no shortage of commitment.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_210.wav|96|That's the day job.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_255.wav|14|Mr Smith declined to comment.)
DUMMY2/p299/p299_265.wav|58|I didn't have a trio.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_119.wav|83|It is rubbish.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_230.wav|68|This could be one such case, he declared.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_145.wav|43|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_267.wav|102|After day one back, he may be revising that opinion already.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_007.wav|96|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_047.wav|59|This represents a tough game for us.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_401.wav|0|What are they for ?
DUMMY2/p270/p270_141.wav|8|I feel very grateful with everything.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_291.wav|44|The pollution and the driving are beyond belief.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_406.wav|107|This is a thoroughly handsome and enjoyable production.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_394.wav|23|She's the runner - she makes the decisions.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_315.wav|5|We are a peaceful people.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_023.wav|65|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. )
DUMMY2/p312/p312_311.wav|62|It's not the end of the matter, of course.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_279.wav|83|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_030.wav|28|I saw the other car coming, but could do nothing.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_169.wav|22|They were behind the wheel.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_254.wav|46|THE arrow was aimed at the heart.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_186.wav|0|A terrorist is a terrorist.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_087.wav|45|Mr Livingstone described the decision as very damaging for the party.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_139.wav|90|Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_198.wav|31|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_065.wav|32|Then followed a bout of flu.)
DUMMY2/p288/p288_084.wav|47|We have other options.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_292.wav|71|"The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland."
DUMMY2/p254/p254_133.wav|41|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_407.wav|22|My thoughts are with their families.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_419.wav|1|This is about the Orange Order.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_389.wav|72|It is not attempting to offer a solution.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_050.wav|90|It's a blessing.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_054.wav|92|There was only one problem, the teacher was still there!
DUMMY2/p250/p250_348.wav|24|A Home Office spokesman said.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_103.wav|67|It is a good day for the coalition.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_212.wav|31|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_194.wav|107|Or so we have long assumed.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_326.wav|4|I was in tears in the street.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_108.wav|81|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_296.wav|86|It just came into my head that day.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_141.wav|56|Why do it otherwise ?
DUMMY2/p267/p267_135.wav|0|So I got a blood test.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_208.wav|59|He demanded to speak to the boss.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_276.wav|31|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_159.wav|75|It's not like us.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_363.wav|28|There were no immediate reports of injuries.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_344.wav|66|We have to go for it.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_035.wav|23|There is a lot of heroin about.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_221.wav|105|She really suffered for her art.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_350.wav|105|I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_247.wav|85|He should emerge as the winner.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_250.wav|86|Her presence was almost everywhere.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_306.wav|66|Last month he made his debut in Japan.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_311.wav|94|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_345.wav|59|He was then replaced by Ross.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_087.wav|32|Tony Blair said as little.)
DUMMY2/p292/p292_383.wav|13|Politics is a tough game.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_318.wav|10|Clydesdale Bank declined to comment.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_350.wav|39|Analysts were not surprised at the talks between the companies.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_066.wav|95|We felt it was sufficient.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_353.wav|31|I was in the train station overnight.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_235.wav|81|Our policy is clear.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_374.wav|69|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_267.wav|4|There is no signature.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_125.wav|81|She really suffered for her art.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_385.wav|50|You have to rely on each other.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_404.wav|54|It was to get even better for Motherwell.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_163.wav|73|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_088.wav|72|So is there anything left to say?
DUMMY2/p239/p239_083.wav|48|But the organisers refused to worry.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_003.wav|35|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_384.wav|37|Do I have a favourite ?
DUMMY2/p226/p226_266.wav|43|The warning is timely.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_355.wav|107|It was a UK-wide report.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_151.wav|73|She is an expert on medical ethics.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_415.wav|35|This should put downward pressure on inflation.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_187.wav|41|Peace was won.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_038.wav|52|He added that her comments were noted.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_121.wav|8|It's not a quick fix.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_223.wav|101|The police have an awful lot to explain.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_353.wav|91|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_029.wav|106|What do we do ?
DUMMY2/p236/p236_302.wav|75|It's all designed to speed up the service.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_327.wav|31|The police have to act to help them.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_165.wav|28|We all have to look in the mirror.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_252.wav|71|"This court has made an order which has not been observed."
DUMMY2/p313/p313_072.wav|76|Before the games it was pretty open.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_029.wav|6|He scored one goal and was on fire.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_317.wav|79|The concerns were unfounded.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_402.wav|104|He promised a final decision within a fortnight.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_020.wav|30|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_366.wav|63|He expected a conclusion by next Thursday.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_331.wav|95|The attacker died in the crash.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_070.wav|74|If only it were so.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_019.wav|27|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_229.wav|44|But there has never been the time, she said.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_419.wav|100|But a surprise is in store.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_202.wav|90|Tommy is not a problem.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_222.wav|47|But it will be sorted out this week.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_333.wav|16|It is a job creation scheme.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_297.wav|4|I seem to keep this for the majors.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_218.wav|63|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_092.wav|3|They have a further report to make in March.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_030.wav|2|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_146.wav|74|Openness is always the best way.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_221.wav|46|Or so it would appear.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_289.wav|92|Agents and coaches must be paid.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_242.wav|8|They are the innocent victims.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_058.wav|18|We need to do that every week.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_163.wav|97|I am totally devoted to this job.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_219.wav|5|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_038.wav|49|Who does he think will win?
DUMMY2/p238/p238_190.wav|37|You just have to accept.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_262.wav|39|Chairman Sir Alistair Grant will remain on the board as deputy chairman.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_329.wav|58|People might not actually want the job.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_340.wav|102|Well, was it?
DUMMY2/p238/p238_349.wav|37|My father died in childbirth.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_215.wav|31|That is an important part of our role.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_177.wav|33|It was really frustrating.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_332.wav|85|It will not work in our favour.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_275.wav|55|I see no reason to doubt that the situation in Scotland is any different.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_131.wav|71|"The Scottish Socialist party is also expected to attend."
DUMMY2/p230/p230_204.wav|35|This is a holy place.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_142.wav|38|That will come after the game on Saturday.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_003.wav|58|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_342.wav|48|I am considered a teenager.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_397.wav|72|You must be ready to play anyone.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_288.wav|43|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_338.wav|67|It has moved on in the last week.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_363.wav|54|It's the curse of our time, irony.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_226.wav|37|I am considered a teenager.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_226.wav|73|Wealth is relative.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_360.wav|65|Blair is very positive at European Councils.)
DUMMY2/p284/p284_070.wav|16|Robin Williams is very subdued.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_177.wav|75|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
DUMMY2/p254/p254_384.wav|41|The service would also make a massive impact on tourism.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_408.wav|35|It is a temptation which should be resisted.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_168.wav|96|That will do for me.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_165.wav|30|However, the referee was not in the giving vein.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_023.wav|53|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_404.wav|4|We're not the tourist board.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_089.wav|63|Potions said he would drive.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_454.wav|32|We think a lot of Allan McGregor.)
DUMMY2/p245/p245_006.wav|59|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_121.wav|77|My conscience is not clear.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_035.wav|33|We have to win every game.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_375.wav|103|We have a team to reach the final.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_217.wav|79|It just could be a good night.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_268.wav|105|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_080.wav|68|I was unconscious for two or three seconds.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_189.wav|33|I am just grateful he is alive.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_275.wav|54|I am now just a bit uneasy.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_098.wav|29|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_039.wav|46|We've tried every other way.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_046.wav|65|The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.)
DUMMY2/p251/p251_136.wav|9|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_030.wav|85|After that, it's a step into the unknown.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_349.wav|13|It was all too little, too late.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_054.wav|106|Surrender is not an appealing or realistic prospect.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_305.wav|66|However, there are also many areas of agreement.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_137.wav|64|All the people thought that he would die.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_198.wav|70|Is that success?
DUMMY2/p301/p301_256.wav|91|Wagner was never like this.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_376.wav|105|I can lead by example.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_134.wav|18|He will be a major challenger next year.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_216.wav|98|There's nothing to be gained by it.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_167.wav|49|It's just a normal life.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_150.wav|13|They missed the boat and everyone suffers.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_309.wav|22|This fact is supported by audience research.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_160.wav|44|They were both delightful to work with.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_290.wav|85|Clearly, the stakes are high.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_451.wav|8|Striking the deal has come as a big relief.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_167.wav|54|They refused to fire on their own countrymen.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_413.wav|39|The company hopes to repeat the process in France.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_090.wav|62|I thought his speech was a disgrace.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_320.wav|37|Tell me today and I will make a business decision tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_024.wav|62|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_170.wav|60|I have a good feeling about this.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_215.wav|6|We can all understand that.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_020.wav|20|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_278.wav|96|They wanted the club to make money.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_026.wav|73|However, the following year the cancer returned.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_044.wav|46|It does make a big difference.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_255.wav|67|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_299.wav|17|It wasn't so pathetic, it would be funny.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_324.wav|66|Instead, she just went away.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_262.wav|24|At half-time he was presented to both teams.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_144.wav|28|I've grown up a bit.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_318.wav|51|It won't happen overnight, but things will get better.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_226.wav|2|At the time, he was a living legend.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_397.wav|25|Not because they want to sing about something.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_090.wav|29|It is open season on the Old Firm.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_146.wav|26|The weather forecast isn't good.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_251.wav|1|We must all play our part.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_334.wav|83|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_140.wav|33|I think we can overcome it.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_254.wav|105|I would have the hammer in the crowd.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_277.wav|69|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_299.wav|105|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_310.wav|60|I've been waiting a long time.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_060.wav|58|He had played well in that central role.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_324.wav|101|There is no plan B.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_043.wav|30|Theatre is not a museum.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_052.wav|75|That was the difference today.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_339.wav|60|You can't get the experience in Austria.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_235.wav|97|They showed a lot of heart.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_119.wav|103|Both offices were closed yesterday.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_206.wav|59|But we have not heard a thing from Diego.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_149.wav|5|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_211.wav|12|He ended up a headmaster.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_347.wav|42|We certainly hope we have been successful.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_245.wav|77|But that's another story for another day.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_093.wav|2|It was mayhem.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_344.wav|74|They said they would.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_033.wav|102|There will be no shortage of quality applicants.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_240.wav|68|They had four children together.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_181.wav|14|I always felt they played for me.)
DUMMY2/p300/p300_248.wav|102|However, BBC Scotland was not interested in his work.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_277.wav|6|He is certainly not looking for another job.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_259.wav|48|We have expanded too quickly.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_180.wav|8|City sentiment is in his favour.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_107.wav|97|This is not a recipe for conflict.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_174.wav|102|It was a bit like having children.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_312.wav|98|They just would not have run away.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_390.wav|38|I find it puzzling and disturbing.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_384.wav|49|Scotland is too small a country for that.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_261.wav|54|We certainly will need to watch him.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_098.wav|6|It was good fun.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_308.wav|24|We have an excellent record of passenger growth and customer service.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_240.wav|71|"It is a policy which has the full support of the minister."
DUMMY2/p233/p233_370.wav|84|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_205.wav|69|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_320.wav|91|I'm very pleased with what we have achieved.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_095.wav|28|It is, honestly, difficult to write about this.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_362.wav|38|She was released from hospital yesterday.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_323.wav|91|Not that Agassi was a believer.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_153.wav|1|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_160.wav|80|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_385.wav|33|It's a fantastic achievement.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_003.wav|85|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_340.wav|105|It was very formal.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_386.wav|69|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_330.wav|36|It's difficult to predict the future.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_058.wav|46|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_300.wav|104|There was no happiness.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_155.wav|11|I have been there already.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_264.wav|72|Had she enjoyed the experience?
DUMMY2/p252/p252_381.wav|55|An appeal was unlikely.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_177.wav|105|There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_143.wav|26|You know the type.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_280.wav|32|I rejected the idea of a separate residence.)
DUMMY2/p271/p271_002.wav|27|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_079.wav|67|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_225.wav|12|And that gives a kind of freedom.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_131.wav|80|Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_166.wav|81|They will do their own thing.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_309.wav|23|That suggests that out fitness is good.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_358.wav|19|Closure is not one of them.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_115.wav|82|Together they will attempt to express the whole.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_119.wav|41|It's a long process.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_037.wav|102|This means that our programme is quite unusual.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_376.wav|42|Above all the aggression must be stopped.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_045.wav|17|He moved back to Edinburgh, where he lived with his mother.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_194.wav|78|Why change it ?
DUMMY2/p304/p304_258.wav|72|I'll never think of myself as a star.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_268.wav|5|We are happy.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_020.wav|7|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. )
DUMMY2/p287/p287_107.wav|77|Why do it otherwise ?
DUMMY2/p248/p248_115.wav|99|This is a scheme that has a lot of potential.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_133.wav|1|We are now in a safe place.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_327.wav|85|His art was not just about emotions.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_038.wav|79|And this was well known?
DUMMY2/p341/p341_405.wav|66|You have to have some hope and faith.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_382.wav|82|Or is it?
DUMMY2/p286/p286_351.wav|63|Is there a waiting list ?
DUMMY2/p252/p252_255.wav|55|It had happened on average once a week this year.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_052.wav|57|He looks like an Afghan.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_162.wav|31|And sooner than we may think.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_338.wav|64|The winner will be announced by early summer.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_007.wav|88|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_083.wav|50|They lived for their children.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_211.wav|61|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_350.wav|82|I am very happy.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_492.wav|65|New York is my home.)
DUMMY2/p278/p278_405.wav|10|We must improve our relations with government.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_415.wav|1|She has now been registered as disabled.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_143.wav|94|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_197.wav|7|I'm interested in interesting work.)
DUMMY2/p277/p277_116.wav|89|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_053.wav|99|He looks like an Afghan.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_199.wav|56|His injury was completely random.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_386.wav|17|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_187.wav|5|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_306.wav|19|It may well have been.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_390.wav|91|Even though the show is seriously exacting, physically demanding.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_132.wav|85|Now, however, things are different.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_083.wav|69|It is a job creation scheme.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_199.wav|45|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_197.wav|49|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_185.wav|95|He was in great spirits.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_052.wav|85|He had no enemies.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_398.wav|96|But they are still unlikely to be involved in combat.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_175.wav|14|The strong performance is expected to continue.)
DUMMY2/p311/p311_164.wav|4|He changed my life.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_077.wav|64|They had not been handcuffed.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_359.wav|27|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_186.wav|85|What is so unusual about this case?
DUMMY2/p226/p226_215.wav|43|I am delighted for Simon.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_233.wav|41|They should come forward.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_136.wav|21|For a few years we had good fun.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_089.wav|15|There has been no cover-up - just the opposite in fact.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_286.wav|100|They can leave at any time.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_022.wav|12|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_121.wav|90|Who would be a referee?
DUMMY2/p251/p251_087.wav|9|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_203.wav|70|It was worth a photograph.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_387.wav|34|There was a fossil on screen.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_102.wav|19|There was no trouble at all.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_380.wav|97|They serve a multitude of purposes.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_420.wav|6|Both were reduced to rubble.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_302.wav|3|But it was also hard.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_293.wav|41|Well, he can do it.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_118.wav|77|She was also very brave.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_378.wav|77|It's only a matter of scale.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_253.wav|46|You're not going to get hurt.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_402.wav|107|Sub Not Used, McArthur.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_339.wav|15|Doesn't matter what you do.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_135.wav|39|I could see his desire for the job in his eyes.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_109.wav|104|That was the context of his remarks.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_058.wav|43|Next league matches Celtic.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_416.wav|42|However, this suggestion was turned down by the player.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_271.wav|68|It wasn't a conscious decision not to shout.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_348.wav|87|Have I really come to this ?
DUMMY2/p274/p274_254.wav|32|Is our children learning ?)
DUMMY2/p340/p340_040.wav|74|You've got to have everything inside with you.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_207.wav|74|It wouldn't matter if he had.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_375.wav|23|The whole experience has left me bitter.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_367.wav|11|Then came the collision with Sergio.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_286.wav|65|The institute board will take the decision.)
DUMMY2/p364/p364_153.wav|88|I don't think it is the case.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_200.wav|26|A deadline is still essential.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_093.wav|36|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_226.wav|8|It was finally agreed on Saturday.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_012.wav|55|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_009.wav|102|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_037.wav|15|It's not Big Brother at sea.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_070.wav|90|They are real.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_241.wav|53|Why change it ?
DUMMY2/p261/p261_445.wav|100|The first game is so important.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_372.wav|27|There is no signature.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_363.wav|65|The purchase was widely criticised by both analysts and investors.)
DUMMY2/p264/p264_036.wav|65|Certainly, we do as well.)
DUMMY2/p262/p262_008.wav|45|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_042.wav|31|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_215.wav|12|If we live forever, can we be said to live?
DUMMY2/p313/p313_123.wav|76|There is a great carry over value.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_168.wav|106|City sentiment is in his favour.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_269.wav|12|THE best marriages are made in heaven.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_051.wav|45|Next league matches Celtic.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_030.wav|99|I have a theory.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_221.wav|101|It's all change at Kilmarnock.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_088.wav|30|We're just a family working hard, working seven days a week.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_332.wav|56|Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_030.wav|82|The Farmer is called an idiot.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_418.wav|22|Bobby Robson called him a genius.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_165.wav|38|It does seem a mystery.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_184.wav|11|But it did not last.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_366.wav|28|Finally action had been taken.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_386.wav|28|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_320.wav|4|We'll see what happens.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_341.wav|12|We won't let you down.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_044.wav|79|I'm sure he does.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_126.wav|20|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_145.wav|4|There was only one problem, the teacher was still there!
DUMMY2/p286/p286_315.wav|63|I was there five months ago.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_208.wav|38|Shaking his head, Mr Cook said he simply couldn't understand it.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_306.wav|61|I was the sheep.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_151.wav|2|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_168.wav|30|After his birthday, Scott was very upset.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_143.wav|23|The proposals were never taken seriously.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_373.wav|10|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_196.wav|101|I think, therefore I am ?
DUMMY2/p280/p280_160.wav|52|A progress report will be published in October.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_388.wav|60|I can understand the frustrations of our fans.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_124.wav|12|I'm sure this game will be equally successful.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_281.wav|21|The error appeared in a warrant.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_004.wav|37|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_309.wav|57|He said she was mad.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_040.wav|19|They hit me in the head.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_209.wav|102|That night was a terrible muddle.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_412.wav|27|He got his degree.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_024.wav|11|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_240.wav|57|She was well balanced.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_120.wav|71|"She really suffered for her art."
DUMMY2/p268/p268_137.wav|87|All the employees are redundant.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_303.wav|10|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_215.wav|97|They do the work, you know.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_300.wav|65|That was around July, August.)
DUMMY2/p313/p313_135.wav|76|I mean it happens.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_208.wav|87|It would make a lot of sense.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_040.wav|69|They're just different.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_488.wav|65|Just look at his fashion sense.)
DUMMY2/p275/p275_185.wav|40|His name was unknown.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_111.wav|100|I cannot explain the grief and pain in my heart.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_186.wav|35|He prefers to play for them.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_121.wav|56|That would open the gates of hell.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_106.wav|65|You're quite wrong, he said.)
DUMMY2/p299/p299_147.wav|58|That is in the very nature of farming.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_270.wav|89|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_442.wav|7|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.)
DUMMY2/p313/p313_134.wav|76|At some point, the bill will be presented.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_085.wav|14|Even the one she loved.)
DUMMY2/p259/p259_429.wav|7|The casualties were not named.)
DUMMY2/p305/p305_035.wav|54|Everyone around the club was supportive.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_150.wav|49|The pilot was making a visual approach.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_320.wav|28|He is involved in everything.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_134.wav|3|It is not so simple.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_042.wav|86|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_110.wav|8|You had better believe it.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_131.wav|63|Then again, we could have.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_145.wav|106|The rise in retail sales was the first since August.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_071.wav|66|Now, just two games into the season, he has gone.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_040.wav|29|Yesterday, he was busy in his office.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_350.wav|35|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_137.wav|16|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_297.wav|7|I felt about this big.)
DUMMY2/p345/p345_156.wav|82|But the damage had been done.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_258.wav|6|I thought his speech was a disgrace.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_020.wav|83|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_249.wav|65|I did not vote either way.)
DUMMY2/p333/p333_167.wav|64|I am very, very happy.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_212.wav|38|But who cares?
DUMMY2/p336/p336_165.wav|98|I am here to work for Scottish Labour.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_270.wav|58|I learned that only yesterday.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_073.wav|43|The script was funny.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_080.wav|21|Painful, but only because it's true.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_155.wav|73|Seven people were later detained by police.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_368.wav|36|The major championships will always have a special place.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_090.wav|87|I am glad I wasn't in it.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_012.wav|43|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_165.wav|7|Behind him was his brother.)
DUMMY2/p232/p232_123.wav|96|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_293.wav|86|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_243.wav|98|You have friends in the Liberal Democrats.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_292.wav|23|We told them in June.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_207.wav|2|It's not before time.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_398.wav|107|It was nerve-racking to watch.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_305.wav|36|There should be room for creative dissent.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_247.wav|60|It's up to the defence team.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_072.wav|14|You should try to have a laugh.)
DUMMY2/p280/p280_365.wav|52|Stephen has never considered the question of compensation.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_027.wav|89|They have no history.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_143.wav|4|We've not won anything yet.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_108.wav|78|On this occasion, the case for a public inquiry was not made.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_222.wav|78|He was not injured in the attack.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_175.wav|98|About time too, you might think.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_221.wav|83|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_347.wav|99|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_085.wav|87|Scottish football is finally on its way back.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_320.wav|34|It was a virus.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_141.wav|46|That is impressive by any standards.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_129.wav|95|That was the first step.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_250.wav|77|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_279.wav|22|There is no substitute.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_289.wav|100|He has not created a Festival resource.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_336.wav|82|I just want to do the good work.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_069.wav|72|We have avoided that at least.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_081.wav|5|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_017.wav|25|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_138.wav|12|We were with him the whole time.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_257.wav|62|It hasn't happened, but other things have.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_389.wav|28|A century on, little has changed.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_181.wav|74|And that's it?
DUMMY2/p233/p233_158.wav|84|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_414.wav|40|Paris is not only young.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_057.wav|33|Now it has become a big picture.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_228.wav|14|The transaction is not feasible.)
DUMMY2/p241/p241_092.wav|86|Today I couldn't run on it.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_004.wav|5|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_166.wav|55|I am secure in my own position.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_236.wav|65|Has the conflict started?)
DUMMY2/p323/p323_183.wav|34|They prefer the short, intensive session.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_166.wav|59|I had a train to catch.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_110.wav|64|It needs somebody to give way.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_386.wav|48|Well, that's just a third district.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_355.wav|16|We have big ideas.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_226.wav|71|"They had no children."
DUMMY2/p270/p270_046.wav|8|I had come back from London.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_361.wav|93|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_401.wav|14|It proved a good decision.)
DUMMY2/p281/p281_354.wav|36|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_164.wav|32|But it is different in different regions.)
DUMMY2/p334/p334_389.wav|38|Would you take them?
DUMMY2/p233/p233_337.wav|84|Sex offender programmes to be retained by public sector.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_367.wav|102|They are also exploited by the markets.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_217.wav|23|He didn't know it was his audition, but it was.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_257.wav|46|I heard some of his remarks.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_420.wav|27|Is there any prospect of this happening?
DUMMY2/p225/p225_281.wav|101|They were not at the property yesterday.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_330.wav|79|In Scotland, there should be vigilance.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_106.wav|21|Actually, it turned out to be the concerto.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_015.wav|85|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_077.wav|51|If you don't enforce it, you bring it into disrepute.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_323.wav|89|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_199.wav|27|It is a farce.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_249.wav|32|The effects are not all bad.)
DUMMY2/p308/p308_067.wav|107|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_008.wav|8|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_372.wav|29|His views are hardly surprising.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_087.wav|13|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_213.wav|22|I would not want to be young again.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_383.wav|28|But this is not just a Tibetan issue.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_141.wav|92|I got very, very tired.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_210.wav|39|We believe the world has too many refugees already.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_092.wav|24|That view is held by many others within the industry.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_103.wav|86|We want to get to the final, anyway.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_214.wav|69|You should always be able to get out in some direction.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_366.wav|68|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_354.wav|77|He was then replaced by Ross.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_393.wav|58|We welcome the proposals, but they must get on with it.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_408.wav|97|That's the law of the land.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_237.wav|65|Have I really come to this?)
DUMMY2/p362/p362_422.wav|15|He got the part.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_027.wav|17|That their music is truly, truly, truly great.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_129.wav|60|We have a long way to go.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_404.wav|69|Whether the High Court will interfere with the sentence is another matter.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_291.wav|73|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_082.wav|103|But then he changed his mind.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_071.wav|95|There's still plenty time left.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_205.wav|7|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.)
DUMMY2/p364/p364_166.wav|88|Now they have to do something about it.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_052.wav|70|There is no reason at all.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_278.wav|77|As for Scotland, we can just enjoy the moment.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_324.wav|107|They would be wise to do just that.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_032.wav|91|The punishment was swift.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_272.wav|83|He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_313.wav|20|The minister is the engineer.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_422.wav|34|I wish it well.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_177.wav|98|We have made mistakes and were badly punished.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_239.wav|9|We were awful.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_353.wav|77|It's wonderful to have won.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_043.wav|77|He will need that machine.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_217.wav|37|I will not take part in Edmonton.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_402.wav|105|Today, he is in the same position as four years ago.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_321.wav|37|We believe a third party was involved.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_035.wav|35|The staff are as good as any staff in the city.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_250.wav|28|Alex Ferguson is the same.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_044.wav|103|Normally, they have been a pack of lies.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_344.wav|12|He was visited by UK consular officials.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_149.wav|88|It's a good story.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_239.wav|34|My life would be a lot less restrictive.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_249.wav|88|He deserves a top team.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_154.wav|52|Three senior officials were dismissed last week.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_227.wav|13|He was on a horse.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_233.wav|72|I'm really excited about the album.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_012.wav|31|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_143.wav|90|The way he took his second goal was brilliant.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_395.wav|51|The home team had an amazing start.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_028.wav|10|She is employed on short-term contracts.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_226.wav|78|I was not overly concerned about this.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_389.wav|35|He could face a jail sentence.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_121.wav|21|This decision is destroying my family.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_365.wav|62|Is it a warning to parents?
DUMMY2/p251/p251_294.wav|9|Things can change.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_007.wav|66|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_188.wav|44|Glasgow then took control.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_116.wav|4|I find it rather oppressive.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_297.wav|27|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_238.wav|32|Customers would then be consulted over any changes.)
DUMMY2/p278/p278_053.wav|10|People come to see the Highlands.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_283.wav|37|Phase one was a shambles.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_181.wav|75|At that point, the structure of the board was changed.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_032.wav|15|I have a very strong opinion about this.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_262.wav|90|I am very angry.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_135.wav|57|Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_255.wav|92|When we started the album.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_211.wav|37|But experts have disputed that statistic.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_090.wav|1|Everything has the potential to be serious.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_348.wav|40|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_177.wav|16|I've been there.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_279.wav|60|Those were the days.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_390.wav|95|It's as wide as a church in here.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_396.wav|85|They are taking a stand against this.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_067.wav|59|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_249.wav|85|We're just waiting for her reaction.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_123.wav|90|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_135.wav|47|Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_072.wav|86|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_299.wav|44|And he had much need.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_097.wav|89|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_038.wav|88|PENSIONS have been hitting the headlines.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_266.wav|62|You are a liar.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_096.wav|1|What do we do for an encore?
DUMMY2/p351/p351_203.wav|33|It makes a huge difference.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_312.wav|96|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_344.wav|0|The US Open was very difficult, but it was enjoyable.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_164.wav|102|I do my job.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_029.wav|84|However, the following year the cancer returned.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_188.wav|40|Four policemen were wounded.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_255.wav|39|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_200.wav|57|I wanted to put myself on the line.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_108.wav|32|Here the jury is still out.)
DUMMY2/p318/p318_111.wav|19|It's just one of those things.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_161.wav|77|The hotel was now for sale.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_119.wav|60|I have spoken to head office.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_065.wav|70|It seems to have worked.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_010.wav|23|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_195.wav|74|However, that is a sizeable if.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_059.wav|55|Or so he thought.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_010.wav|43|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_181.wav|37|We're very fortunate to have these new products to focus on.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_212.wav|58|It is all one-sided.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_302.wav|96|Nothing is safe.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_353.wav|76|He was made redundant in February of last year.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_248.wav|22|This is the New Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_343.wav|96|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_248.wav|23|But one shouldn't go by that.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_372.wav|96|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_131.wav|0|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_401.wav|78|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_182.wav|104|A decision is expected in September.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_315.wav|94|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_219.wav|17|Thankfully, we have started to listen to our customers.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_333.wav|7|Is there a waiting list ?)
DUMMY2/p245/p245_312.wav|59|They wanted the club to make money.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_153.wav|75|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_247.wav|100|We have come a long way in the last few sessions.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_188.wav|25|Does this matter?
DUMMY2/p329/p329_130.wav|103|It was an ambush.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_182.wav|56|Was it the wife ?
DUMMY2/p227/p227_066.wav|29|Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_346.wav|21|He, too, was unlucky not to get a goal.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_059.wav|31|Equity declined to comment.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_189.wav|68|It is simple and easy to use.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_051.wav|17|Lothian and Borders police are appealing for witnesses.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_257.wav|52|Commercial producers were present in large numbers.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_300.wav|39|The record companies have gone through the floor.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_231.wav|38|He is adamant that he is innocent.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_339.wav|2|Our policy is clear.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_148.wav|44|All kinds of things occur.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_278.wav|68|He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_321.wav|2|There was no time scale.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_394.wav|42|I ran to get out of the way.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_235.wav|2|It's quite nice.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_345.wav|72|Things start to talk to each other.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_125.wav|72|We told them in August.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_053.wav|50|The cuts were made within an hour of each other.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_045.wav|90|No meaningful response was issued.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_372.wav|104|But opponents were quick to criticise.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_026.wav|68|There will be widespread support on all sides.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_032.wav|41|So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_023.wav|17|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_485.wav|48|I was there five months ago.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_391.wav|15|He can win every week.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_127.wav|46|It is just part of modern day life.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_274.wav|55|The long-term trend is equally clear.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_286.wav|76|We're talking about the outskirts of London.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_220.wav|16|The report is due out next month.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_416.wav|6|That's the name of the game, though.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_284.wav|10|The stage was set for a showdown.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_243.wav|25|He will go a long way.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_277.wav|21|I just need a bit of luck.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_227.wav|25|It is a gamble.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_382.wav|77|This remains the party's policy.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_106.wav|1|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_284.wav|104|This is our chance in Northern Ireland.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_239.wav|98|It's a bit like a bereavement.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_172.wav|75|It's nice to be nice.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_144.wav|72|I can't remember a lot about the accident.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_081.wav|102|His options are severely limited.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_260.wav|12|He must have something up his sleeve.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_136.wav|56|She had gone to the Catholic school.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_279.wav|106|This is absolutely not true.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_218.wav|82|But we are losing that connection.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_252.wav|37|was everything done to save people ?
DUMMY2/p340/p340_177.wav|74|It gives us hope.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_186.wav|90|They need to look after themselves.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_421.wav|34|As often as not, the cause remains a mystery.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_323.wav|44|She is, however, fully conscious and able to speak.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_146.wav|65|Mr Dewar understood that.)
DUMMY2/p285/p285_006.wav|2|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_350.wav|70|That would help.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_113.wav|97|The company has other problems with the shells.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_213.wav|105|I might come back.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_453.wav|100|I was embarrassed by it.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_212.wav|70|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_323.wav|99|Who will do it?
DUMMY2/p260/p260_287.wav|81|Bombing slaughter rejected
DUMMY2/p241/p241_294.wav|86|What has altered?
DUMMY2/p272/p272_204.wav|69|A Grampian Police spokesman said.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_256.wav|16|They must play for each other.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_376.wav|46|Public confidence was undermined by that terrible tragedy.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_116.wav|77|We did what we had to do.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_190.wav|40|What has caused the demise of singing?
DUMMY2/p301/p301_310.wav|91|Of further privacy, he had no need.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_303.wav|74|I've heard it all before.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_145.wav|28|For a moment it was all about her.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_120.wav|29|Why do it otherwise ?
DUMMY2/p252/p252_178.wav|55|All options are available.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_259.wav|64|You're not going to get hurt.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_098.wav|25|The peace process will be buried!
DUMMY2/p295/p295_147.wav|92|Clearly we are looking at this very carefully.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_149.wav|64|We actually haven't managed to meet demand.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_196.wav|50|I came home by ambulance.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_059.wav|3|There was no safety net.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_179.wav|58|The sense of excitement in Stirling is tangible.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_326.wav|3|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
DUMMY2/p272/p272_126.wav|69|There were no grounds for his action.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_069.wav|4|I have a choice.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_411.wav|104|It raises the edge.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_143.wav|63|The manager's position was obviously included in that review.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_138.wav|92|I haven't had a lesson in four years.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_410.wav|38|All credit to them, they took their chances, we didn't.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_092.wav|54|He had done his homework properly.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_387.wav|69|I was in the train station overnight.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_303.wav|19|I'm sure everyone will be delighted for them.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_261.wav|105|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_210.wav|24|And we have the experience.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_045.wav|73|I guess I was lucky, though.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_263.wav|58|Having guidelines in advance is helpful.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_263.wav|37|Not a great deal has changed in the last decade.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_165.wav|80|These days are long gone.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_028.wav|35|Life was like a timetable.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_146.wav|51|Now we look forward to it.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_346.wav|31|I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_008.wav|89|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_386.wav|46|Is that where we are?
DUMMY2/p261/p261_060.wav|100|Do I have a favourite ?
DUMMY2/p229/p229_150.wav|67|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_017.wav|54|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_270.wav|23|The defender made an impressive debut.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_027.wav|47|Is this accurate?
DUMMY2/p276/p276_424.wav|106|The might be rolled out.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_199.wav|105|IT S all in the hair.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_415.wav|104|I don't entirely buy that.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_098.wav|62|He added, The old system has reached its limits.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_125.wav|36|She does not want to speak.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_242.wav|40|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_363.wav|101|There is The Beautiful Game to write.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_385.wav|98|We were beaten by the better team today.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_260.wav|11|I feel sorry for the Reds.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_028.wav|17|It feels like a winner already.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_048.wav|12|But all forms of the illness are treatable.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_444.wav|8|It shows the right amount of progress.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_252.wav|102|I just saw them for a few minutes.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_351.wav|23|Today, we begin to answer that question.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_150.wav|58|Thousands of homes were left without power supplies.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_028.wav|58|Gilbert was not amused.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_432.wav|105|They will form a tribute.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_078.wav|16|People must remain vigilant.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_292.wav|63|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_236.wav|47|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_318.wav|85|The police believe that the man was not injured.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_351.wav|52|I think we are back on track.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_408.wav|42|Everything is now in place for Manchester.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_403.wav|103|Who has he fought?
DUMMY2/p261/p261_316.wav|100|That is the general feeling.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_038.wav|22|That respect is missing in the Netherlands.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_351.wav|67|They may yet have the last laugh.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_272.wav|85|I should have given him one in return.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_028.wav|103|The investment programme will deliver these improvements.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_451.wav|27|It was ignored.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_227.wav|37|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_279.wav|98|He denied the charge.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_153.wav|95|It will be retained as part of the group.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_033.wav|29|It is not for any other purpose.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_225.wav|105|I think he's the favourite, no question.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_373.wav|84|It was a hit.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_114.wav|79|They have to tell it as it is.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_202.wav|54|The minister is the engineer.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_073.wav|70|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_293.wav|19|This year, it was a little different.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_410.wav|22|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_326.wav|87|I won't make an official complaint.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_121.wav|74|Johnsen is equally concerned.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_385.wav|65|His third child was born in April.)
DUMMY2/p250/p250_494.wav|24|I am delighted for everyone in Airdrie.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_170.wav|18|The goal is clear.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_283.wav|103|We are taking it seriously.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_222.wav|23|Sadly the jury were not convinced.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_381.wav|15|He was on a horse.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_396.wav|58|I'll take what comes along.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_129.wav|25|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_362.wav|94|I HAVE a dream.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_326.wav|5|He scored a touchdown.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_077.wav|14|I was as strong as a horse.)
DUMMY2/p301/p301_166.wav|91|However, who could have predicted this result?
DUMMY2/p265/p265_167.wav|73|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_295.wav|59|Nothing is safe.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_306.wav|11|But it has all been worthwhile.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_274.wav|14|How independent is that ?)
DUMMY2/p310/p310_100.wav|17|After that nothing could save him.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_359.wav|29|I am very interested in the subject.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_108.wav|85|I did not have faith in the procedures.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_053.wav|90|I would love to have him home.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_295.wav|55|Kenny and I are ready.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_062.wav|49|I think, overall, they were the best team in the tournament.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_234.wav|92|His father and mother are in film production.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_082.wav|2|They lived for their children.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_144.wav|82|In fact, they will not be disciplined.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_377.wav|36|Everything is now in place for Manchester.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_197.wav|12|We have only nine months to go.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_022.wav|98|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_051.wav|60|When he came to see me on Monday.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_413.wav|79|That can benefit the larger companies.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_205.wav|90|But she might be.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_194.wav|44|We know them as mobile telephones.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_289.wav|57|The home was now under new management.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_300.wav|63|You have to expect this type of thing.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_098.wav|82|However, his involvement was instant.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_031.wav|105|It was clear.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_246.wav|47|He's a lovely young man.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_319.wav|77|We have a good healthy debate.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_255.wav|105|He thought he had a month to cross the street.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_149.wav|91|What the Department of Transport will make clear.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_094.wav|44|Scotland were beaten again.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_172.wav|39|These days are long gone.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_047.wav|48|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_091.wav|34|It also makes for interesting viewing.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_086.wav|89|Today she has been released.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_137.wav|21|All the pressure will be on him.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_126.wav|100|That would open the gates of hell.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_133.wav|102|We haven't actually considered it down here.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_173.wav|102|It has been recorded twice.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_184.wav|27|If that's the case, he will struggle.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_383.wav|107|It's like a garage.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_012.wav|98|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_393.wav|51|There must be boundaries.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_319.wav|83|Feel the air, the space.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_151.wav|25|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_133.wav|63|Structural changes were also required.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_026.wav|14|Meetings will also remain private.)
DUMMY2/p330/p330_319.wav|1|It's just that we see different things.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_385.wav|40|It can help.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_045.wav|46|How many cases have there been?
DUMMY2/p229/p229_359.wav|67|That is a break with tradition.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_270.wav|59|People have no choice.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_084.wav|75|However, the approach is not believed to be hostile.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_163.wav|14|He's not a Celtic man.)
DUMMY2/p232/p232_026.wav|96|But it failed.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_244.wav|52|how do you get it back ?
DUMMY2/p317/p317_277.wav|97|But someone forgot to tell the Chechens.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_064.wav|103|We're not the tourist board.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_042.wav|99|I was scared.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_393.wav|78|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
DUMMY2/p316/p316_320.wav|85|There was too much at stake.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_252.wav|51|A Scottish film studio is also being considered.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_097.wav|62|What happens next?
DUMMY2/p258/p258_322.wav|26|He said she was mad.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_261.wav|20|Note the date.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_162.wav|13|You cannot enter the clubhouse.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_378.wav|96|The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_208.wav|83|Twaddle is a case in point.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_161.wav|84|Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_149.wav|28|Our position is clear.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_268.wav|91|Racism has no place in any sport.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_066.wav|57|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_253.wav|2|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_301.wav|20|I was brought up in a mining background.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_057.wav|93|I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_265.wav|2|The system can work.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_031.wav|16|I'd just like to play.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_335.wav|61|He can do no wrong.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_167.wav|18|Tomorrow is a big day for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_376.wav|37|I have little time for analysts.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_360.wav|40|All the investment is possible through the public sector.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_158.wav|38|This is not, however, a General Election reshuffle.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_174.wav|72|On Saturday, it was much the same.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_291.wav|106|Initial market reaction was close to euphoric.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_243.wav|50|Nato was not a love affair.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_264.wav|22|It's the same old story.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_304.wav|76|I'm not a fan of books.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_333.wav|106|We are trying to clarify the issues.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_370.wav|37|Not that Barber has been unhappy.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_175.wav|10|Was it the wife ?
DUMMY2/p313/p313_179.wav|76|He's got a great chance of making it.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_241.wav|9|Police later said the scheme would end in November.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_378.wav|45|I am very happy with life.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_175.wav|6|Scotland won by six wickets.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_369.wav|76|His appointment was generally welcomed yesterday.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_247.wav|72|I've enjoyed the whole experience.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_035.wav|18|This would give Scotland around eight members.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_069.wav|55|It would have to be.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_261.wav|25|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_197.wav|95|The expansion will be financed by the Clydesdale Bank.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_252.wav|29|The irony was not lost.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_151.wav|37|Gordon Marshall was outstanding against us.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_241.wav|57|It's only fair.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_195.wav|88|Mr Wallace was unimpressed.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_158.wav|95|It has become a way of life.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_387.wav|2|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_039.wav|10|The whole thing was filmed in Hollywood.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_372.wav|62|For his opposite number, this was a just triumph.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_099.wav|66|We certainly will need to watch him.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_104.wav|106|Context is also very important.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_334.wav|56|Nobody said it was required.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_028.wav|70|However, the following year the cancer returned.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_346.wav|72|I would like to stay with Rangers.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_267.wav|87|Bobby Williamson has been brilliant.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_092.wav|76|The crucial strike was yet to come.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_051.wav|53|I'm as fit as I can get.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_099.wav|15|What kind of person is he?
DUMMY2/p260/p260_148.wav|81|The weather forecast isn't good.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_268.wav|25|It's very nice.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_015.wav|97|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_356.wav|24|I'd like to take the plunge.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_137.wav|74|This research is extremely promising.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_053.wav|21|This was never a support group.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_036.wav|69|Was it worth it?
DUMMY2/p238/p238_119.wav|37|What form did that take ?
DUMMY2/p330/p330_180.wav|1|He urged Mr Blair to get out more.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_205.wav|21|That has proved to be a lasting lesson.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_242.wav|61|Police later said the scheme would end in November.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_191.wav|12|Twaddle is a case in point.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_150.wav|20|So I got a blood test.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_423.wav|76|The whole nation will be delighted.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_038.wav|4|That's what we're still trying to do.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_236.wav|67|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_006.wav|75|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_022.wav|89|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_167.wav|91|Shyness has rarely sold in boxing terms.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_152.wav|80|It is not just about pay.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_046.wav|97|I would think they are just behind them.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_103.wav|28|Brown is an interesting man, but he's not desperate.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_342.wav|53|Perhaps she met her husband too early, she says.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_158.wav|74|He was as good as his word.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_447.wav|89|That was the first time I worked with Richard.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_146.wav|42|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_305.wav|61|We have to sort it out ourselves.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_030.wav|12|It was between myself, the management, and the team.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_133.wav|64|A young Briton had a lucky escape.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_266.wav|3|Not in this production he doesn't.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_125.wav|82|Our intentions are real.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_207.wav|4|Yet the survey has been cautious.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_076.wav|79|I've got to be better than that   Quite.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_156.wav|68|Equity declined to comment.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_280.wav|107|However, the move was bitterly criticised last night.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_021.wav|75|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_350.wav|9|He did a good job.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_337.wav|80|A new season has offered a fresh start for both men.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_089.wav|61|Now the system is right behind us.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_328.wav|97|It is good for their eyesight.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_469.wav|24|The move is considered a major breakthrough.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_404.wav|0|You thought it was a headache.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_029.wav|101|What do we do ?
DUMMY2/p237/p237_021.wav|61|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_108.wav|25|They will want to perform well.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_080.wav|1|I will not be in dialogue with her.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_187.wav|100|He prefers to play for them.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_331.wav|43|Donald was his friend.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_091.wav|82|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_090.wav|85|Mini rugby is a great thing.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_298.wav|106|Manchester United can win the European Cup this season.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_172.wav|25|His team management was protective.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_202.wav|13|Three weeks later, he resigned.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_442.wav|32|Their condition is described as satisfactory.)
DUMMY2/p236/p236_024.wav|75|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_015.wav|44|The Greeks used it to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_180.wav|72|They've got to decide to do that.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_153.wav|19|Glasgow, however, did not get a mention.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_072.wav|1|We're trying to lessen the stigma.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_040.wav|52|Everyone has to prove a point when they cross that white line.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_130.wav|25|Some of the characters will not be played by humans.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_211.wav|44|Many, many people don't know who he is.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_059.wav|99|It will take time.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_170.wav|107|But she's also beautiful behind the face.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_046.wav|7|Merger would be entirely logical.)
DUMMY2/p281/p281_113.wav|36|Or it would have been.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_155.wav|2|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_330.wav|99|Indeed, it was magical.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_044.wav|84|At the moment, we do not know the extent of their injuries.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_125.wav|30|We are still getting signals.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_068.wav|83|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_171.wav|56|It shows the strength of the roots.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_231.wav|82|We have all been there at some point.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_182.wav|63|This championship is different from the other majors.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_276.wav|22|Many other Scottish locations also feature.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_375.wav|82|Suddenly, there was an audience.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_127.wav|49|I've seen some of the submissions.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_164.wav|64|There are no charges.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_211.wav|1|The cold war is over.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_200.wav|89|Even a shopping trip was a cause for excitement.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_290.wav|68|If Glasgow is so interested, they have the right to bid.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_016.wav|105|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_213.wav|52|Scottish football yesterday appeared ready to line up alongside the Scotland manager.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_160.wav|55|Finally, we decided to put the whole speech in.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_232.wav|9|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_282.wav|76|I'm confident we can do that.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_203.wav|78|At the top level, the salaries are far too high.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_157.wav|95|It opens the door to the Champions League.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_383.wav|41|I'm just enjoying every match.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_292.wav|66|The whole team was rubbish.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_011.wav|27|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_064.wav|16|I've spent a lot of time on buses.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_091.wav|98|It was very fast.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_252.wav|6|Then one day it happened.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_248.wav|53|The pair will meet again in Glasgow, and then train together in Australia.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_068.wav|88|I see no need to change.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_407.wav|14|There was an element of frustration.)
DUMMY2/p231/p231_309.wav|50|He is still in shock.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_170.wav|0|They made such decisions in London.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_062.wav|9|It's that kind of place.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_313.wav|65|It is his speed off the mark that is so impressive.)
DUMMY2/p313/p313_213.wav|76|The squad will be the same for France.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_394.wav|65|His deal is effective for two years, starting in July.)
DUMMY2/p272/p272_010.wav|69|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_381.wav|36|He has seen the past.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_050.wav|93|Who can say?
DUMMY2/p293/p293_267.wav|23|It's been quite a turnaround for Miami.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_332.wav|37|Which isn't a bad idea.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_098.wav|96|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_134.wav|17|He wanted someone young and ambitious.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_010.wav|59|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_274.wav|51|Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_403.wav|107|It's a very high number.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_206.wav|25|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_259.wav|11|The court has not decided.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_407.wav|18|It is an investment in our product.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_370.wav|7|Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.)
DUMMY2/p279/p279_347.wav|25|It is horrible.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_160.wav|0|Nobody did in those days.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_302.wav|68|That left a bad taste in my mouth.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_102.wav|24|Had I heard ?
DUMMY2/p334/p334_236.wav|38|I will have to order its destruction.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_113.wav|104|I don't know the nature of the illness.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_168.wav|26|Mr Blunkett said he was deeply concerned by the ruling.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_245.wav|81|There's the mix.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_026.wav|23|Theatre is not a museum.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_153.wav|20|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_261.wav|62|It was that bad, that low.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_213.wav|3|Equally, he is grateful to have survived the cull.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_321.wav|1|I am very happy with life.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_237.wav|60|I want to celebrate the World Cup.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_161.wav|13|It is about the script for me.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_021.wav|6|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_403.wav|27|It is an absolute nonsense.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_117.wav|91|Since then, they have fallen by more than two thirds.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_428.wav|75|I believe the gap is nearly there.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_144.wav|106|Four meetings have previously been arranged.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_328.wav|73|She said they would appeal.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_136.wav|76|This week is a perfect example.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_296.wav|78|Is our children learning ?
DUMMY2/p246/p246_119.wav|5|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_269.wav|89|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_382.wav|62|The urgency is real.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_081.wav|71|"No progress has been made."
DUMMY2/p231/p231_369.wav|50|Lord Macdonald has worked on this deal for three months.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_265.wav|9|They know no other way.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_152.wav|28|Then in came a succession of signings.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_094.wav|40|It is a love affair.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_033.wav|61|This is the window.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_393.wav|14|It has happened for generations.)
DUMMY2/p307/p307_130.wav|22|We need to move forward together.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_048.wav|41|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_240.wav|55|That time is not far away.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_140.wav|58|A world away from Rangers, you might say.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_471.wav|24|I see no reason to have this debate at this time.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_328.wav|77|It wasn't a good day for us.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_316.wav|43|The whole region is in shock.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_452.wav|75|It is a cause for concern.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_262.wav|68|She may even appear in some more films.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_360.wav|78|It was a test in itself.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_003.wav|59|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_045.wav|84|All businesses continue to trade.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_138.wav|100|Check that he is dead.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_326.wav|29|The dealer is on notice.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_329.wav|11|This is great news for us.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_288.wav|86|It is a vote of confidence in the skills in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_400.wav|60|That is the difference.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_329.wav|59|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_220.wav|12|There are a lot of unanswered questions.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_313.wav|7|We have an excellent record of passenger growth and customer service.)
DUMMY2/p237/p237_008.wav|61|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_095.wav|71|"Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights."
DUMMY2/p269/p269_349.wav|94|Her husband was very concerned that it might be fatal.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_031.wav|33|He added, We have the same desire.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_289.wav|37|He is a serial Conservative assassin.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_333.wav|52|These options include the possible merger or sale of the company.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_202.wav|95|how do you get it back ?
DUMMY2/p266/p266_418.wav|20|That may be.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_316.wav|24|I wanted to change the formula.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_370.wav|76|The hearing was fair.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_242.wav|69|I can't get a job.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_120.wav|8|You can spend money on housing.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_382.wav|72|He is at war with his knee.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_179.wav|13|Market research indicates that this is not feasible.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_290.wav|60|That is the key.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_298.wav|89|The plot is minimal.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_242.wav|6|It was an excellent performance.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_322.wav|46|I was doing well at the hustings.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_023.wav|94|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_350.wav|29|This is a trend which will be encouraged.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_418.wav|6|Overall, it has certainly worked out.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_391.wav|95|It would be quite nice.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_233.wav|55|The Queen was on the ball yesterday but off the Euro.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_324.wav|16|I would love it.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_153.wav|93|Mr Blair had done well.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_177.wav|25|The clarity is vital.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_013.wav|28|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_378.wav|14|Yesterday was a statement of intent.)
DUMMY2/p336/p336_380.wav|98|It runs in cycles.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_149.wav|0|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_410.wav|95|The BBC was a disgrace.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_407.wav|35|The casualties were not named.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_424.wav|92|There is still the question of his health.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_069.wav|46|He already had had complaints.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_300.wav|82|He is an excellent defender, strong and quick.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_154.wav|41|You know the type.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_211.wav|22|But he just carried on anyway.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_077.wav|42|Raised the way you want it.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_108.wav|42|She died in middle age.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_372.wav|107|This, too, could prove a risky business.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_100.wav|75|Our house was very small.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_031.wav|68|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_135.wav|63|His job was not advertised.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_092.wav|106|Authorities have to recognise the risk of paedophiles.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_266.wav|80|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_285.wav|75|They can leave at any time.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_372.wav|100|Had this been common practice ?
DUMMY2/p334/p334_019.wav|38|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_036.wav|35|This represents a tough game for us.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_254.wav|82|Hospitals and school building will go ahead.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_148.wav|7|how do you get it back ?)
DUMMY2/p231/p231_378.wav|50|to have products for their needs.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_218.wav|88|I had a son.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_331.wav|3|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_320.wav|63|He has taken the title for the last two years.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_269.wav|98|I've got three other ideas for the day.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_406.wav|76|It's going to be a new challenge.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_305.wav|46|The chief constable is right.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_386.wav|52|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
DUMMY2/p279/p279_339.wav|25|The boat was fantastic.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_227.wav|1|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_193.wav|2|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_149.wav|55|Was it the wife ?
DUMMY2/p227/p227_206.wav|29|My heart is with the artist.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_065.wav|76|The house was so well alight.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_234.wav|79|He knew they were there.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_196.wav|47|But we are not immune to the problem.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_027.wav|94|He said the matter had been neglected in the past.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_019.wav|89|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_012.wav|82|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_436.wav|100|By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_390.wav|89|It's like a basketball.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_007.wav|51|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_214.wav|92|What happened in this instance is serious misconduct.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_246.wav|23|He doesn't need to be told, he knows the truth.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_222.wav|63|The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_130.wav|64|Both these events occurred on Wednesday night.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_128.wav|71|"It's the big omission."
DUMMY2/p301/p301_329.wav|91|I played well on Saturday and again today.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_061.wav|18|A government is a government is a government.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_403.wav|18|She was so supportive.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_263.wav|93|I was happily surprised.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_309.wav|61|It is a road of death.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_264.wav|7|Does that put pressure on us ?)
DUMMY2/p237/p237_210.wav|61|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_051.wav|2|I love the Dome.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_261.wav|106|Mr Blair had done well.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_068.wav|104|Domestic abuse is related to power and control.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_185.wav|59|He's not perfect.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_317.wav|95|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_152.wav|103|Perhaps they knew something we didn't.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_265.wav|26|He thought he had a month to cross the street.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_122.wav|83|We enjoyed it today.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_142.wav|80|We need to chat.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_290.wav|34|We didn't enjoy the first game, but today they were excellent.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_042.wav|84|He was in his element.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_031.wav|12|I don't believe you own anything.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_016.wav|80|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_158.wav|55|He nearly killed my son.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_111.wav|73|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_253.wav|49|I played well on Saturday and again today.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_232.wav|68|The merger was welcomed by Tony Blair.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_306.wav|23|Again the verdict was not proven.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_263.wav|69|We're in shock.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_116.wav|35|Lady Thatcher was the only woman with full membership.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_346.wav|47|I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_204.wav|90|They've got three-quarters of the way.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_059.wav|75|But retail banking would be run from Halifax.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_250.wav|103|That could be at least five years away.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_267.wav|34|Such debate is pointless.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_104.wav|81|That's all right then.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_006.wav|16|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_146.wav|87|Does the name matter ?
DUMMY2/p231/p231_068.wav|50|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_215.wav|82|At the time, he was a living legend.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_143.wav|34|She is now planning a visit.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_316.wav|89|Off with their heads.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_157.wav|83|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_411.wav|78|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_090.wav|9|It is an old family habit.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_072.wav|17|Apart from that, they would not be making any comment.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_305.wav|30|Millions of British jobs depend on Europe.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_372.wav|82|People can really get themselves in a mess.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_032.wav|10|If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_246.wav|97|We need to tighten up.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_393.wav|42|There is certainly no single outstanding candidate.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_312.wav|102|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_134.wav|59|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_215.wav|25|Twaddle is a case in point.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_179.wav|34|In the eyes of the supporters, there has been a betrayal.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_337.wav|69|That has been lost.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_348.wav|63|Is our children learning ?
DUMMY2/p261/p261_387.wav|100|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_217.wav|71|"Clearly, the stakes are high."
DUMMY2/p264/p264_209.wav|65|The labour side has developed in the North area.)
DUMMY2/p232/p232_092.wav|96|Today I couldn't run on it.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_140.wav|93|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_139.wav|80|It was very frightened and dirty.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_304.wav|83|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_099.wav|89|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_010.wav|91|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_463.wav|50|Nine days later, he suffered another attack.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_135.wav|24|We have a team to reach the final.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_043.wav|98|Yet therein is the problem.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_031.wav|10|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_015.wav|32|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. )
DUMMY2/p288/p288_323.wav|47|For the moment, our position remains the same.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_348.wav|77|It is not all good news and relief for Labour, however.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_224.wav|21|She is currently in foster care.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_350.wav|46|Surely, if anything, it would be the other way round.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_038.wav|54|I want a free vote.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_243.wav|12|It need not be like that.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_070.wav|46|How come it is so often unnoticed?
DUMMY2/p312/p312_142.wav|62|This should include procedures for personal imports.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_219.wav|60|There will be good prospects ahead.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_326.wav|27|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_228.wav|27|I will win.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_138.wav|25|It's perfectly feasible.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_171.wav|60|And the results were impressive.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_291.wav|61|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_416.wav|1|You have to work with what you've got.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_275.wav|60|It disappeared into the cup.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_074.wav|3|We were under a bit of pressure.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_275.wav|98|I reckon he won't make the mistake again.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_082.wav|54|But they must serve their sentence in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_346.wav|83|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_270.wav|98|Some injustice was committed.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_485.wav|65|I believe in theatre.)
DUMMY2/p231/p231_012.wav|50|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_358.wav|70|He could make it.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_434.wav|105|The bill would be massive.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_312.wav|55|He had served his time.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_337.wav|64|You encourage them - you can do it.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_354.wav|58|Do you mean today?
DUMMY2/p276/p276_021.wav|106|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_037.wav|90|At this stage, we think the air campaign is enough.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_114.wav|52|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
DUMMY2/p251/p251_014.wav|9|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_162.wav|98|I hope he gets it.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_097.wav|12|It's not a new concept in jazz.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_385.wav|36|He has been a success this year.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_228.wav|43|I am immensely sad.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_138.wav|19|Receiving this medal is an honour.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_284.wav|58|It is quite an eye opener.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_350.wav|80|It is horrible.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_089.wav|55|It was exactly four months away.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_244.wav|42|We just wish they had done so before.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_371.wav|18|I thought it was a great game.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_265.wav|34|It's a very high number.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_061.wav|68|The supporters gave us a lot of passion.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_217.wav|2|That has been the easy part.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_323.wav|2|Either team will be hard.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_409.wav|60|What's the problem with change?
DUMMY2/p254/p254_143.wav|41|I was the last man to touch the ball.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_280.wav|52|The life office will now stay with Abbey.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_301.wav|72|I can't stand this sort of stuff.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_384.wav|46|There are moments of honesty, too.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_316.wav|94|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_284.wav|88|Clearly, the future remains uncertain.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_056.wav|42|That is an important part of our role.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_059.wav|95|How are you, sir ?
DUMMY2/p243/p243_153.wav|53|Do you think we are a top nation ?
DUMMY2/p295/p295_129.wav|92|Axis itself was created from that exercise.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_144.wav|24|We did what we had to do.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_319.wav|52|That's the danger when you have to play too many young players.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_227.wav|75|That might help a bit.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_058.wav|80|It is unique.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_113.wav|82|I have been thinking about that this week.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_334.wav|28|The mood was defiant.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_435.wav|14|It's going to be epic.)
DUMMY2/p227/p227_343.wav|29|That decision will be made over the next couple of days.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_047.wav|9|Hopefully, it will be built by next year.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_195.wav|11|The stadium was full.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_155.wav|87|Prospects for equity markets remain uncertain.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_337.wav|55|Is our children learning ?
DUMMY2/p316/p316_403.wav|85|In my experience, he does not do that.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_196.wav|73|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_059.wav|12|He was taken ill in December last year.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_207.wav|12|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_329.wav|17|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_356.wav|34|I understand the medical concerns.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_332.wav|61|It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_061.wav|74|He was right of course.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_385.wav|91|At the moment, it is being treated as a tragic accident.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_287.wav|54|Surrey police said no body had been found.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_376.wav|38|I'm delighted for Simon.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_384.wav|47|It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_263.wav|65|The proposal was rejected.)
DUMMY2/p267/p267_100.wav|0|They will notice a difference.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_206.wav|77|Who was she ?
DUMMY2/p374/p374_078.wav|11|This is a great day.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_419.wav|7|I had a fortunate war.)
DUMMY2/p317/p317_273.wav|97|We are committed to urgent action.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_007.wav|43|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_127.wav|99|So the European elections are extremely important.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_365.wav|72|There was no disruption to services.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_239.wav|17|It's a difficult job.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_226.wav|66|That's the day job.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_256.wav|58|We don't have the credible evidence.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_268.wav|40|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_301.wav|36|The orchestra is quite good, but the hall is terrible.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_098.wav|93|It was a good performance.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_057.wav|10|None has ever been found.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_064.wav|90|And a film maker was born.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_220.wav|17|We will not break even.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_047.wav|60|Next league matches, Dundee United Rangers.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_297.wav|43|There's a pause.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_190.wav|43|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_276.wav|56|Both companies have had a rough ride in recent years.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_005.wav|21|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_285.wav|54|The road was closed for several hours.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_453.wav|50|We put our bid in last night.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_281.wav|35|They can leave at any time.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_159.wav|61|It is not normal practice.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_384.wav|74|We have a plan in place.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_031.wav|6|Visitors are directed instantly to the shop.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_386.wav|25|He is on the wrong side.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_388.wav|85|I'm delighted, and the players were brilliant.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_349.wav|32|That is a trend which will be encouraged.)
DUMMY2/p316/p316_122.wav|85|That would depend on the parole board.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_329.wav|23|The event has now gone to Helsinki.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_041.wav|104|I've been dying for an hour.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_059.wav|16|We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_201.wav|35|Racism has no place in any sport.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_143.wav|7|Are you going to win ?)
DUMMY2/p264/p264_035.wav|65|This remains the case.)
DUMMY2/p231/p231_090.wav|50|I saw the whole thing.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_040.wav|72|He is dying from cancer.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_251.wav|43|There's the mix.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_215.wav|51|We have an attorney on the ground.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_414.wav|17|Who has he fought?
DUMMY2/p362/p362_098.wav|15|I thought he was my friend.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_157.wav|55|He said some things which were better left alone.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_132.wav|107|Mary Archer is almost too clever.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_223.wav|2|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_234.wav|31|Our numbers are small.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_241.wav|106|Does it matter ?
DUMMY2/p273/p273_088.wav|56|It was clear on Thursday.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_197.wav|23|I'm a bit annoyed.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_099.wav|40|Oil embargo endorsed.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_170.wav|104|We have managed to get it under control.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_183.wav|3|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_194.wav|46|Glasgow deserved their win, but we made them look good.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_279.wav|21|We are talking about one family.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_125.wav|56|I am totally devoted to this job.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_132.wav|46|All the people thought that we would die.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_279.wav|90|It happens from time to time.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_236.wav|69|The scene is about this?
DUMMY2/p229/p229_102.wav|67|The court heard he drove into the path of a car.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_383.wav|62|They have been for some time now.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_117.wav|103|The event has now gone to Helsinki.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_097.wav|52|Put simply, it goes something like this.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_187.wav|37|This is a frightening development.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_415.wav|8|Shelter also supports the reform.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_180.wav|33|It would have very little impact on them.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_093.wav|55|Even if he doesn't have any lines.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_059.wav|97|I've had to take time off work today.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_366.wav|50|They should take their mobile phones.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_057.wav|63|The outcome of their game isn't the important thing.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_300.wav|73|Kids are terrible.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_189.wav|96|They receive a high profile in the media.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_037.wav|16|It's a fact.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_081.wav|59|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_313.wav|29|It could well be military.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_115.wav|6|We have learned a tremendous amount.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_463.wav|39|To tell the truth, it wasn't a good game.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_315.wav|65|Such a policy is for long-term strength.)
DUMMY2/p299/p299_041.wav|58|If you have to pay for treatment, you pay for treatment.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_261.wav|86|It looks as though he will be right.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_340.wav|61|It has moved on in the last week.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_050.wav|49|But he just carried on anyway.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_265.wav|76|By this point the couple were approaching fast.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_024.wav|64|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_276.wav|11|It is our other home.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_116.wav|8|The problem was a social problem.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_114.wav|31|Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_106.wav|13|On that basis, he would set it aside.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_136.wav|65|However, it's possible that Dick can have influence some Dutch players to go there.)
DUMMY2/p314/p314_126.wav|51|But then he changed his mind.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_312.wav|39|The Government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_207.wav|43|It's a mixture of everything.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_210.wav|82|But it is looking very positive.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_251.wav|95|The problem was you thought you were a big man.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_199.wav|0|He had suffered a heart attack.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_013.wav|101|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_345.wav|23|The package has been properly costed.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_119.wav|92|There were far more pressing matters to consider.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_063.wav|104|How is he enjoying life as a senior?
DUMMY2/p298/p298_313.wav|68|Rapid revision was required.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_095.wav|80|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_185.wav|42|There is no guarantee.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_232.wav|78|Other villages were completely deserted.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_106.wav|48|He will be kept informed.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_083.wav|75|The Queen Mother is dead.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_017.wav|104|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_060.wav|29|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_300.wav|36|He added that the business was in good shape.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_313.wav|86|It should be equal.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_043.wav|15|They were impressive against France.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_072.wav|41|Four other charges were dropped.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_013.wav|55|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_249.wav|69|This is the first step.
