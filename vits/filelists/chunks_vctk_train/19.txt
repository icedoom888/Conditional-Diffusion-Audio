DUMMY2/p285/p285_229.wav|2|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_131.wav|102|That group reported just before Christmas.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_295.wav|13|They are in good spirits.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_163.wav|42|We meet again in Berlin.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_384.wav|84|That will come after the game on Saturday.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_112.wav|86|The breakdown was much later in her life.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_091.wav|57|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_099.wav|24|So what is the campaign about ?
DUMMY2/p301/p301_023.wav|91|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_262.wav|87|You had to go and see him.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_130.wav|56|The study is expected to last until the middle of the year.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_112.wav|46|It is a serious offence of reckless conduct.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_405.wav|16|It will take place in July.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_207.wav|87|I love the spectacle of cinema.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_226.wav|58|Bill is a mentor.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_299.wav|43|There was no hint of scandal.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_224.wav|105|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_417.wav|40|It all began as an accident.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_092.wav|58|We certainly will need to watch him.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_063.wav|65|You could very well be.)
DUMMY2/p250/p250_255.wav|24|The right decision has been made.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_007.wav|54|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_384.wav|33|This should include procedures for personal imports.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_371.wav|20|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_099.wav|94|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_290.wav|56|We feel very comfortable in this international environment.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_366.wav|39|But we welcome this document.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_432.wav|106|If he saw somebody in trouble, he would try to help.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_248.wav|56|I'm not making any specific attempt on the world record.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_240.wav|76|Life was like a timetable.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_427.wav|100|He's had to suffer for the last six years.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_163.wav|59|We did everything by the book.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_079.wav|4|It's the same as Glasgow.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_458.wav|39|He doesn't like the Labour Party.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_244.wav|36|Wilson will tell the truth.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_095.wav|9|Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_342.wav|100|Is there a waiting list ?
DUMMY2/p273/p273_217.wav|56|William Hague delighted his party.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_013.wav|51|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_343.wav|19|It's no less intriguing, however.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_144.wav|79|It was a big departure.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_401.wav|19|I found that much more challenging.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_334.wav|32|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.)
DUMMY2/p240/p240_347.wav|93|It is so unfair.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_106.wav|102|We are so, so lucky, so many people have died.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_129.wav|107|The New Deal will constantly be improved.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_348.wav|41|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_380.wav|11|Is something which we just don't do.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_099.wav|97|He asked me in a tolerance zone.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_389.wav|56|They have not done so this season so far.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_231.wav|42|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_017.wav|40|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_003.wav|72|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_153.wav|27|The amount of energy in a tornado is enormous.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_175.wav|82|We should have gone solo.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_230.wav|14|William Hague delighted his party.)
DUMMY2/p293/p293_144.wav|23|The Treasury denied the claims.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_026.wav|52|His secretary said it was a matter for Murray Financial to deal with.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_077.wav|28|It's just gotten too big.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_187.wav|27|The goals were good.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_315.wav|60|We are looking for Scotland to be inspired.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_040.wav|95|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_030.wav|4|Strictly speaking, it shouldn't be like this.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_141.wav|57|I was the last man to touch the ball.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_410.wav|15|Figures are not relevant to the strategy.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_113.wav|80|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_262.wav|10|Paterson can afford to be generous.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_312.wav|20|You should be.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_340.wav|35|You may have a short memory.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_205.wav|30|We have chosen for the patients.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_255.wav|68|We have reacted well to each other.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_378.wav|13|That would have killed the match.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_291.wav|58|There is a cup final at stake.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_061.wav|36|We will pay their bills.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_343.wav|86|Tiger is the exception.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_253.wav|76|It is a memorial.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_401.wav|51|The best option is to destroy the plants.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_358.wav|32|Governments will have to respond.)
DUMMY2/p329/p329_038.wav|103|I spoke with just one player, but not the others.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_003.wav|94|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_311.wav|75|We can work all night.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_176.wav|99|IT S the real thing, for sure.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_066.wav|1|Others may be trying to catch up.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_224.wav|1|After about a year, the feeling returned to my finger.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_257.wav|34|Are we here?
DUMMY2/p288/p288_212.wav|47|I was so nervous.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_111.wav|39|It has been a nightmare of frustration.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_106.wav|77|Mr Blair should be warned.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_379.wav|46|It's been like that for ages, according to the guys.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_297.wav|95|They are very keen to work with us.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_208.wav|79|The pace is telling.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_103.wav|106|It wasn't possible to relax.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_174.wav|95|My Dad is a hero.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_189.wav|94|We did everything by the book.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_352.wav|100|Public opinion was split on the proposal.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_408.wav|74|My daughter was really, really innocent.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_410.wav|6|Clearly the impact is going to be negative.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_102.wav|55|They had three children.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_084.wav|6|They are difficult awards to decide.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_231.wav|1|Craig is still suffering seizures.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_014.wav|17|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_174.wav|60|I was a silly bastard.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_117.wav|81|It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_315.wav|72|It's to do with context.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_399.wav|24|The law would appear to be on our side.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_260.wav|100|I should think so, too.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_052.wav|66|You see, it wasn't a tournament of equals.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_274.wav|76|My mother is a widow.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_038.wav|77|Among them are many criminals.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_185.wav|105|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_345.wav|43|They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_076.wav|62|He was charged with perjury.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_218.wav|0|It was a crazy day.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_284.wav|8|I understand the security issue.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_264.wav|92|What was the cause of all this outrage?
DUMMY2/p302/p302_015.wav|30|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the god to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_225.wav|88|We just have to improve.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_306.wav|0|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_366.wav|102|And here is the rub.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_254.wav|37|Do I think about them often ?
DUMMY2/p343/p343_108.wav|21|I've got to get noticed!
DUMMY2/p363/p363_298.wav|6|What was the cause of all this outrage?
DUMMY2/p273/p273_175.wav|56|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_396.wav|10|The law would appear to be on our side.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_032.wav|32|Costs have got to be controlled.)
DUMMY2/p374/p374_226.wav|11|There are moments of honesty, too.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_124.wav|58|Yet he chose to do something different.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_320.wav|32|Are they free ?)
DUMMY2/p238/p238_057.wav|37|Has the conflict started ?
DUMMY2/p257/p257_231.wav|105|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_327.wav|17|The goal will stay with me forever.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_290.wav|24|I feel really confident in that department.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_012.wav|95|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_327.wav|91|Nowadays, it is workers united.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_162.wav|95|The Prime Minister was informed on Thursday.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_234.wav|94|It's like a basketball.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_064.wav|72|Mrs Anderson said this one was different.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_231.wav|9|We played them off the pitch.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_406.wav|87|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_125.wav|67|It is rubbish.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_298.wav|81|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_046.wav|63|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_339.wav|64|I always said No.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_221.wav|51|The text is reduced to bubbles.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_126.wav|107|And perhaps it is as simple as that.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_301.wav|29|It's hard to see it.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_203.wav|56|It had all been arranged.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_094.wav|18|He doesn't even know who he is.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_414.wav|64|A judicial review is also being considered.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_332.wav|34|Such is the ego involved.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_335.wav|49|I don't have any more contact with Airdrie.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_091.wav|50|But I know the course.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_013.wav|42|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_300.wav|67|I was brought up in a mining background.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_217.wav|16|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_359.wav|9|It is not like working for a living.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_323.wav|54|We didn't know he was even out.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_045.wav|36|Among them are many criminals.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_353.wav|100|The election is total confusion and chaos.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_067.wav|63|It's not covered by the insurance.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_125.wav|16|She really suffered for her art.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_270.wav|49|It was frightening, intense, and primal theatre.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_235.wav|34|I think my game is suited to grass.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_163.wav|66|I love the tradition of vaudeville.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_326.wav|79|It just got out of control.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_027.wav|82|All the people here are local.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_001.wav|84|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_004.wav|8|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_093.wav|4|It is set in Paris.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_213.wav|34|Three other people were treated for minor injuries.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_502.wav|48|McPherson came from United Biscuits.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_266.wav|4|Sub Not Used, McCormick.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_136.wav|77|It will clearly be discussed in cabinet.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_278.wav|59|Yet, it worked.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_128.wav|102|She says the royal family get on well.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_264.wav|78|It expected this trend to continue.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_018.wav|64|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_097.wav|3|We have to have a full statement to Parliament.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_138.wav|38|Could you put it in writing?
DUMMY2/p360/p360_001.wav|60|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_102.wav|18|To have Mr Clinton is quite an accolade.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_432.wav|56|It is not a standing army.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_252.wav|86|Special measures were needed.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_305.wav|81|They are wrong.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_239.wav|100|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_059.wav|28|This is all part of opening the door.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_256.wav|83|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_290.wav|22|Everything has been destroyed.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_070.wav|1|I let go the telephone and ran.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_191.wav|9|Last night was a key episode.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_316.wav|16|Special measures were needed.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_012.wav|105|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_131.wav|85|Too much has already been said.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_025.wav|44|It is bad news for the flooded areas.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_107.wav|29|Then came the farewell to Europe.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_009.wav|4|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_073.wav|32|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.)
DUMMY2/p254/p254_073.wav|41|They're appalled by that.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_174.wav|19|Dewar is the medium.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_179.wav|6|Perhaps it was just as well.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_200.wav|106|However, the problem is the timing.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_092.wav|27|It is a lifeline.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_073.wav|9|It is a time bomb.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_151.wav|60|This has been carried out.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_347.wav|91|I just want to change my life.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_298.wav|56|The rescue package is public money.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_109.wav|94|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_360.wav|70|Now, though, he has an incentive.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_314.wav|84|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_153.wav|8|They have not been named.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_391.wav|68|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
DUMMY2/p298/p298_113.wav|68|Winning, meanwhile, is headed back to New York City.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_272.wav|18|It was a classic.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_116.wav|63|In the end we made too many errors.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_142.wav|90|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_037.wav|19|This was the performance, and the result they needed.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_135.wav|43|I do not think this family will ever get over this.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_298.wav|45|The results are sometimes contentious.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_015.wav|77|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_333.wav|96|I'd like to take the plunge.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_009.wav|50|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_417.wav|50|He liked the weather, the courses, the food.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_252.wav|62|Was it a foul?
DUMMY2/p341/p341_312.wav|66|There is nothing like a fresh start.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_081.wav|16|He had taken everything from me.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_053.wav|34|How well did they get on?
DUMMY2/p297/p297_159.wav|42|The captaincy will help that, too.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_192.wav|12|These elements are in the book.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_019.wav|37|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_313.wav|80|Is there on his hands?
DUMMY2/p288/p288_405.wav|47|Quality Meat Scotland was vigorous in its defence of the labelling.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_345.wav|91|Maybe we expected too much from the fixture.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_186.wav|41|The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_061.wav|53|Talks have continued at many different levels.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_121.wav|76|It was a journey into a new life.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_141.wav|101|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_026.wav|49|Her condition last night was described as critical.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_141.wav|5|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_201.wav|89|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_156.wav|73|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_091.wav|30|He was a crazy man.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_443.wav|14|Last week against Nelson, we allowed them several opportunities.)
DUMMY2/p276/p276_385.wav|106|McCall is unlikely to change a winning team.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_286.wav|38|The Open champion is back.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_229.wav|93|At the time, he was a living legend.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_360.wav|24|What form did that take ?
DUMMY2/p265/p265_074.wav|73|A play is a set of actions.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_002.wav|42|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_143.wav|47|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_302.wav|55|So does every industry.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_326.wav|12|She is now on the back benches.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_255.wav|33|I wish it wasn't so, but it is.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_370.wav|74|It is a tragedy for the area.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_056.wav|73|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_209.wav|80|I have a cold.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_300.wav|74|Police have appealed for witnesses.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_349.wav|20|There may be reasons for it.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_293.wav|10|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_385.wav|32|It will be completed within a year.)
DUMMY2/p307/p307_274.wav|22|The pilot was making a visual approach.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_090.wav|47|It is a lifeline.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_067.wav|74|It's probably just as well.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_234.wav|75|His third goal was superb.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_293.wav|103|It was nice to get a clean sheet.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_213.wav|77|His third goal was superb.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_250.wav|49|Alex is a big part of that future.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_053.wav|45|It's very odd.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_078.wav|105|Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_285.wav|99|It is a vote of confidence in the skills in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_137.wav|62|I was blown out of proportion.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_254.wav|28|My family, health and golf is always a balancing act.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_280.wav|7|No date has been fixed for his return.)
DUMMY2/p284/p284_222.wav|16|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_050.wav|19|My brother is buried under there.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_405.wav|26|They are not left wing.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_167.wav|9|You are not going in blind.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_182.wav|103|Whenever we heard about this decision we protested.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_257.wav|57|Is that a serious question ?
DUMMY2/p374/p374_313.wav|11|We are satisfied with this outcome.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_238.wav|72|But they will need to play to score.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_087.wav|22|It has never been worthwhile.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_195.wav|72|They will have five minutes to decide.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_394.wav|78|After the match, do you ?
DUMMY2/p306/p306_080.wav|12|The table was compiled by the Daily Telegraph.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_145.wav|22|It is patently true.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_266.wav|95|It had so much to do with output.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_383.wav|10|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
DUMMY2/p297/p297_186.wav|42|Some may end up in hospital.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_043.wav|72|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_365.wav|24|It has to solve the nuclear waste disposal problem.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_346.wav|57|That is a break with tradition.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_358.wav|76|Closure is not one of them.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_074.wav|80|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
DUMMY2/p234/p234_287.wav|3|How independent is that ?
DUMMY2/p287/p287_263.wav|77|That should be the subject matter of a public debate.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_329.wav|27|It is a job creation scheme.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_089.wav|6|It was decided he should be dismissed.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_205.wav|107|We have chosen for the patients.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_077.wav|97|Will we ever play together again?
DUMMY2/p263/p263_096.wav|39|No-one in the passenger train was hurt.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_254.wav|34|Everything is up for grabs.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_135.wav|67|It's an amazing landscape !
DUMMY2/p285/p285_403.wav|2|Emotions were complex.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_215.wav|69|It's not before time.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_039.wav|87|How are you, sir ?
DUMMY2/p256/p256_269.wav|90|Of course, that is not the whole story.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_332.wav|20|However, they will only be found in the wild.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_332.wav|102|He made no big mistakes.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_087.wav|8|The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_054.wav|103|She has a wonderful mind.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_391.wav|54|This is entirely appropriate and overdue.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_179.wav|81|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_387.wav|32|Everything is now in place for Manchester.)
DUMMY2/p335/p335_205.wav|49|It is best value.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_333.wav|100|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_239.wav|55|The board do not own the company.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_375.wav|16|They have not done so this season so far.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_159.wav|18|The enemy was time.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_374.wav|4|I recommend a tour.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_151.wav|3|As for the warning, it was not needed.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_132.wav|80|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_202.wav|20|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_298.wav|99|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_095.wav|103|It wasn't a conscious decision not to shout.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_218.wav|6|Where is the evidence?
DUMMY2/p273/p273_235.wav|56|He said the move followed a downturn in business travel.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_134.wav|62|It may be down, but New York is not out.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_142.wav|105|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_102.wav|50|It's not a quick fix.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_285.wav|44|They are so easy for youngsters to open.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_389.wav|85|I can't describe it.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_245.wav|10|He does not much like the Liberal Democrats.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_233.wav|43|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_299.wav|88|You will be very, very welcome.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_033.wav|52|I want to give everything to Rangers while I am with the club.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_376.wav|34|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_334.wav|82|I feel sorry for anyone coming in here.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_264.wav|3|Scotland played a major part in the project.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_217.wav|0|It is good for our team.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_021.wav|29|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_420.wav|38|No evidence that it was Osama bin Laden.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_036.wav|5|It has failed.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_273.wav|68|It is now very clear that doesn't work.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_125.wav|75|Something will be done by corporate bodies.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_080.wav|35|It's so hard to shift.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_378.wav|2|You can cope with it.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_314.wav|85|We told them in July.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_337.wav|43|I'd like to take the plunge.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_230.wav|63|His injury was completely random.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_241.wav|74|Government funding is not a problem.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_400.wav|39|They have put in a lot of time and effort.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_020.wav|65|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. )
DUMMY2/p307/p307_171.wav|22|The problem arises because he does so much.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_229.wav|19|It does not take much.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_260.wav|83|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_005.wav|59|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_313.wav|96|I never thought it would take this long.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_370.wav|16|All the investment is possible through the public sector.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_147.wav|107|I could feel the blood on my face.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_007.wav|73|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_263.wav|7|I was just a kid.)
DUMMY2/p312/p312_226.wav|62|Such a city does not exist.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_351.wav|93|Look at the witnesses.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_029.wav|55|Do not give your details to anyone.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_139.wav|58|I had a tie in my hand.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_141.wav|88|New investment will be openly tendered.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_173.wav|66|My house was shaking at the time.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_329.wav|8|It is a court case.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_269.wav|39|It should have taken a year for a company this size.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_342.wav|17|I don't expect to see that this time.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_233.wav|93|The body follows the mind.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_425.wav|36|That's the way it works.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_312.wav|62|Sub Not Used, McKay.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_146.wav|90|It is not just about pay.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_040.wav|55|He too started on the subs seats.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_053.wav|73|They are real.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_090.wav|38|Mr Miller is married with three children.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_039.wav|62|I wish it wasn't so, but it is.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_136.wav|14|This should begin in October.)
DUMMY2/p339/p339_063.wav|18|I am not retaining him.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_239.wav|40|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_332.wav|55|Someone should tell them.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_395.wav|20|He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_072.wav|55|That is not possible.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_067.wav|20|It's all I can do.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_126.wav|6|he announced his plans.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_341.wav|43|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_120.wav|22|You do not change overnight.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_253.wav|48|The challenge for the industry is to capture and retain that talent.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_142.wav|47|A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_202.wav|87|It is all to do with the coaching.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_008.wav|94|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_215.wav|22|The Yugoslav army will still be there.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_217.wav|63|They have the cash and the fire power.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_195.wav|18|First, the programme was unbalanced.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_316.wav|25|Craig is a major concern for us.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_080.wav|102|The table was compiled by the Daily Telegraph.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_240.wav|60|And what happens?
DUMMY2/p251/p251_038.wav|9|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_106.wav|89|Our position remains unchanged.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_316.wav|35|Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_345.wav|34|That's why the young musicians have joined.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_223.wav|96|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_224.wav|79|There were other problems for Brown yesterday.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_067.wav|41|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_172.wav|103|You probably have never seen them before.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_304.wav|86|I was concerned with the way they tried to justify his actions.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_326.wav|96|It's not long enough.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_290.wav|45|The death toll included five children.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_189.wav|107|People buy everything with cash.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_185.wav|39|Waiting times for these services are too long.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_357.wav|25|I lost my head.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_207.wav|49|They should come forward.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_097.wav|85|I hope it comes out all right.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_232.wav|65|Wall Street provided the British market with little fresh direction.)
DUMMY2/p361/p361_397.wav|79|He was too good for me - too consistent.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_168.wav|28|She is a very lucky young lady.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_361.wav|2|All the investment is possible through the public sector.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_288.wav|13|However, we had no failures in our side.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_355.wav|38|We have always been, and remain confident of the securing of order.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_334.wav|8|The advisers had some discussions but no conclusion was reached.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_001.wav|18|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_381.wav|7|But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party.)
DUMMY2/p230/p230_191.wav|35|We represent a wide range of society.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_324.wav|42|I'll never have problems with any football managers.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_170.wav|91|The pressure on the aid agencies is immense.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_163.wav|35|Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_223.wav|1|I think it is a great idea.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_148.wav|4|This is in a league of its own.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_110.wav|47|On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_164.wav|96|That must be left to the Parole Board.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_090.wav|16|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_349.wav|0|He is not very big, either.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_058.wav|55|I agree with you about this.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_230.wav|59|The problem in Norway is outside the National.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_167.wav|98|I can't do anything before nine.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_069.wav|7|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.)
DUMMY2/p335/p335_118.wav|49|For sure, you won't know unless you ask him.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_367.wav|16|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_211.wav|23|Pitt, of course, would play the lead singer.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_168.wav|10|US is the only country to vote against resolution.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_036.wav|90|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_172.wav|101|Nobody did in those days.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_040.wav|47|But it took a lot of bottle.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_362.wav|63|My view has now completely changed.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_125.wav|21|But it's been kept to a minimum.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_162.wav|8|They've also enjoyed their share of good fortune.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_402.wav|74|It wants them to go home.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_079.wav|55|Do I have a favourite ?
DUMMY2/p300/p300_018.wav|102|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_230.wav|38|So far they have refused.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_128.wav|105|It's terrible that he has died the same way.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_257.wav|72|The council has been open and transparent.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_268.wav|100|And they were being paid ?
DUMMY2/p273/p273_264.wav|56|This will look at consumer attitudes.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_059.wav|51|The spirit in the squad is certainly good.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_162.wav|2|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_473.wav|75|They make a selective perception process.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_183.wav|107|Smith has not let him down.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_060.wav|75|I have proved that in the past.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_093.wav|68|He didn't have time for any other hobbies.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_232.wav|12|For the other parties, it is back to business as usual.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_311.wav|83|You may have a short memory.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_164.wav|24|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_087.wav|73|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_043.wav|1|What was going through her mind that day, that night?
DUMMY2/p329/p329_062.wav|103|I am still pretty young in this business.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_332.wav|77|What are they for ?
DUMMY2/p361/p361_297.wav|79|They went back to the seventeenth.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_066.wav|50|We will pay their bills.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_111.wav|15|Sacking John Redwood is a disaster.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_094.wav|107|The boat was fully equipped with safety equipment.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_264.wav|4|All the children on the roll are genuine.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_238.wav|102|It is difficult when you don't know anyone.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_281.wav|41|If not, he should go home.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_010.wav|102|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_001.wav|3|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_028.wav|51|Princess Margaret is being buried on that day.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_094.wav|89|It is a blow.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_075.wav|35|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_371.wav|97|I am so lucky for that.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_002.wav|52|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_213.wav|84|It was worth a photograph.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_258.wav|77|We are in a war.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_277.wav|63|was everything done to save people ?
DUMMY2/p334/p334_122.wav|38|It may now be too expensive for anyone.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_260.wav|50|The concerns are the same.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_380.wav|28|Even then he was in the media spotlight.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_203.wav|5|He knows a lot.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_121.wav|84|I joined a group.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_127.wav|77|I miss the freedom that I had.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_135.wav|84|Tenants will be unable to defend themselves.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_160.wav|82|And so they have.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_253.wav|103|The sense of excitement in Stirling is tangible.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_320.wav|59|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_251.wav|105|There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_387.wav|102|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_324.wav|60|Hopefully, it will be good enough.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_413.wav|96|It was that bad, that low.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_206.wav|31|The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_116.wav|73|Twaddle is a case in point.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_342.wav|61|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_318.wav|18|Referees in Scotland are very weak.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_108.wav|80|The court heard he drove into the path of a car.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_199.wav|92|My intentions are to go on like this.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_051.wav|22|It was, however, the wrong side.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_188.wav|62|I probably would have been a dancer.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_140.wav|61|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_330.wav|94|Kids are terrible.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_287.wav|37|They are determined to make a meaningful contribution.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_331.wav|29|I'm not worried about the critics.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_297.wav|6|I want to make a difference.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_271.wav|74|They made up for it on Saturday.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_156.wav|38|He was not deterred.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_009.wav|24|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_208.wav|92|Last night they were being comforted by relatives.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_276.wav|42|They are declining elsewhere in the UK.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_006.wav|54|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_252.wav|77|It makes no difference to their friendship.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_363.wav|66|The place became a war zone.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_008.wav|40|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_413.wav|56|I remain a buyer of the shares.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_095.wav|54|We will have to see, but it makes you think.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_121.wav|103|Now, though, he is back playing superbly for Blackburn.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_180.wav|64|In less than two months, the women have achieved a lot.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_137.wav|50|This is a successful outcome.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_219.wav|0|Edinburgh was not included in the survey.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_254.wav|63|Customers would then be consulted over any changes.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_142.wav|66|They are still going to be impulsive.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_144.wav|74|How did he know?
DUMMY2/p248/p248_069.wav|99|Have a look at our accounts.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_071.wav|22|That's just the way the game is evolving.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_422.wav|6|Hopefully, the answer is in the positive.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_220.wav|31|It's been a good year.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_247.wav|59|They need to look after themselves.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_352.wav|22|Law abiding motorists have nothing to fear.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_101.wav|10|So what is the campaign about ?
DUMMY2/p258/p258_372.wav|26|I thought he was my friend.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_020.wav|54|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_232.wav|26|They tried to give her advice.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_004.wav|52|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_197.wav|50|I suggest a new plan.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_037.wav|87|He works at the airport.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_112.wav|98|That is how we will be judged.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_252.wav|27|You can feel at home in China.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_038.wav|20|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_087.wav|27|By then, he was walking on water.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_105.wav|103|He lost his job, but it was not just a job.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_095.wav|40|May not have been at fault?
DUMMY2/p259/p259_093.wav|7|The commission initiated the necessary changes in the financial regulation.)
DUMMY2/p227/p227_212.wav|29|how do you get it back ?
DUMMY2/p360/p360_189.wav|60|Maintain the highest standards.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_312.wav|4|We have not given up on the game.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_202.wav|6|Tomorrow we begin again as New Yorkers.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_322.wav|94|I did not name it.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_386.wav|13|He is just a wonderful actor.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_360.wav|93|He had played well in that central role.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_381.wav|6|The challenge is to win a cup.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_276.wav|24|This is no reflection on Rangers.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_064.wav|67|We should have known.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_305.wav|70|The letters are going out today.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_154.wav|57|I am just trying to do my job.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_245.wav|86|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_312.wav|65|They might surprise themselves.)
DUMMY2/p230/p230_387.wav|35|There was a substantial explosion.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_285.wav|78|If he saw somebody in trouble, he would try to help.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_176.wav|43|If that's the case, he will struggle.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_301.wav|102|He was then replaced by Ross.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_105.wav|88|This is a horrible loss.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_377.wav|92|I'm astonished by this decision.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_218.wav|21|If he leaves, the band is finished.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_456.wav|8|We expect a rise by the end of the second quarter.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_287.wav|71|"That could change."
DUMMY2/p286/p286_205.wav|63|What are you not good at ?
DUMMY2/p266/p266_308.wav|20|This is a war over our home.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_004.wav|12|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_102.wav|94|Oil embargo endorsed.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_225.wav|91|I, like many others, will consider where we go from here.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_213.wav|61|Now, it's all right.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_411.wav|13|Colour was at the core of his life.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_102.wav|48|But they also noted a partial strengthening of survey evidence.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_078.wav|30|I cannot believe she has been admonished.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_251.wav|100|They showed a lot of heart.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_095.wav|95|They lived for their children.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_217.wav|73|At the time, he was a living legend.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_252.wav|20|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_356.wav|96|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_276.wav|53|Despite Labour's recent problems, it has not been able to do that.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_320.wav|10|It's unlikely to be renewed.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_096.wav|93|They were outside the circle.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_378.wav|102|Off-duty nurses were called in at Ayr.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_047.wav|5|Is a drug dealer?
DUMMY2/p284/p284_254.wav|16|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_035.wav|36|She failed in her action.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_278.wav|66|His wife Margaret was not in court.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_408.wav|95|It proved a good decision.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_376.wav|74|Sadly, it took a tragedy to change things.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_010.wav|15|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_003.wav|60|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_386.wav|58|It was meant to rival the dollar.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_237.wav|78|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_018.wav|91|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_008.wav|70|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_211.wav|43|But I am a worried man.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_088.wav|55|That remains the same.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_090.wav|88|Nature will not find its own level.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_156.wav|107|These men could be anywhere in the world.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_366.wav|10|We put our bid in last night.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_222.wav|50|That you can do it.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_010.wav|70|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_244.wav|99|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_074.wav|70|It could take some time.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_379.wav|63|Scrutiny by the European Parliament is limited.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_325.wav|83|The same things will happen with GM foods.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_196.wav|104|I want a career.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_201.wav|56|From there, they can go anywhere.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_279.wav|50|At first I thought I was gone.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_050.wav|2|It's a miracle.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_379.wav|69|Since then, he has played no active part in the company.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_189.wav|2|There is no openness.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_046.wav|11|It is so out of character.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_338.wav|14|It was an achievement all right.)
DUMMY2/p345/p345_370.wav|82|I don't believe a word of it.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_155.wav|91|I was loving that little girl.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_375.wav|107|Ferguson should take note.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_207.wav|96|I don't want to use it.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_114.wav|35|That admission is not surprising.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_170.wav|20|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_308.wav|64|I think that could work to our advantage.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_077.wav|71|"This is the way things should be handled."
DUMMY2/p237/p237_003.wav|61|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_247.wav|52|Church leaders warned other homes could close.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_103.wav|76|Although, you never know.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_320.wav|83|Is there a new way forward?
DUMMY2/p227/p227_025.wav|29|Meetings will also remain private.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_294.wav|39|It will always be the highlight of my career.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_099.wav|70|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_084.wav|93|He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_038.wav|62|This is really good news for us.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_231.wav|89|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_175.wav|94|Waiting times for these services are too long.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_162.wav|14|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis.)
DUMMY2/p294/p294_209.wav|104|And do you know, it just wasn't the same.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_009.wav|98|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_109.wav|93|It had been played at festivals.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_015.wav|66|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_305.wav|107|Millions of British jobs depend on Europe.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_013.wav|32|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. )
DUMMY2/p351/p351_230.wav|33|I would have the hammer in the crowd.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_292.wav|44|I have been coming here for nine years.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_147.wav|28|Once they go away they won't come back.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_047.wav|6|This has come as a shock to everyone.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_393.wav|13|John Prescott is John Prescott, as the prime minister would say.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_244.wav|98|I believe in theatre.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_150.wav|3|It is too pretty, it is too small.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_193.wav|78|Was it the wife ?
DUMMY2/p341/p341_184.wav|66|It's the whole season.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_069.wav|47|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_227.wav|61|You have to do your research.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_353.wav|106|The move follows a review of the Singapore
DUMMY2/p258/p258_254.wav|26|We need to move away from the culture of long hours.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_189.wav|100|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_217.wav|86|A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_054.wav|88|There is no doubt about that.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_058.wav|89|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_115.wav|41|It is normal.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_351.wav|99|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_241.wav|91|That is nearly four people every day.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_324.wav|58|The Chosen One doesn't always excel.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_084.wav|70|I first met him last summer.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_072.wav|72|That is completely against Islam.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_258.wav|38|The balance isn't there at EMI.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_037.wav|86|It's nice to hear.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_227.wav|100|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_159.wav|0|However, he urged the trade to keep the faith.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_108.wav|60|We opened up and everything was gone.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_286.wav|32|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.)
DUMMY2/p305/p305_030.wav|54|It is a catalogue of obstruction.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_167.wav|61|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_021.wav|98|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_310.wav|96|He was solid.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_391.wav|1|He was located after going to Singapore.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_163.wav|106|That's what happened against Ayr.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_359.wav|49|It is like a theatre of the absurd.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_360.wav|4|What does he want him to look like?
DUMMY2/p362/p362_199.wav|15|We know the quality of life goes up.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_277.wav|98|If so, we want to hear from them.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_035.wav|10|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_119.wav|57|It's in his blood.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_336.wav|0|They are now out in the cold.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_001.wav|4|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_242.wav|106|How do you take them away ?
DUMMY2/p257/p257_273.wav|105|You've got to have both sides.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_133.wav|40|She said she would not welcome the flowers.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_254.wav|87|The strong performance is expected to continue.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_179.wav|15|What was that all about?
DUMMY2/p225/p225_199.wav|101|And they were being paid ?
DUMMY2/p245/p245_013.wav|59|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_311.wav|11|It was just awful.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_352.wav|17|It is now time for justice.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_115.wav|52|So what happens next ?
DUMMY2/p360/p360_335.wav|60|That is a tragedy.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_095.wav|29|You are like an animal.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_055.wav|39|Already, he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_078.wav|92|But let's not get ahead of ourselves.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_143.wav|97|MOVIE stars are public property.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_052.wav|81|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_231.wav|46|That is very, very bad news for our nation.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_033.wav|63|I feel so desperately sorry for Gordon and Sarah.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_069.wav|17|In fact, they will not be disciplined.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_253.wav|94|We decided we would go for a specialist inside centre.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_184.wav|77|They were seriously after him.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_012.wav|51|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_256.wav|85|If they don't, they might well decide not to play.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_390.wav|37|It's difficult to put a date on.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_292.wav|86|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_054.wav|73|I've spent a lot of time on buses.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_024.wav|100|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_140.wav|25|This represents a tough game for us.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_358.wav|7|I didn't have the reply.)
DUMMY2/p336/p336_224.wav|98|It's the last thing on my mind.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_298.wav|80|However, the snow was welcomed by some.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_065.wav|28|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_104.wav|54|It was a wilful act of violence.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_171.wav|30|There is no date on this document.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_150.wav|43|We just had a go.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_122.wav|43|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_070.wav|21|That is really all.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_065.wav|21|I'm just delighted to take it.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_234.wav|42|I enjoyed my work in the Scottish Office.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_117.wav|71|"It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged."
DUMMY2/p266/p266_375.wav|20|By that time, however, it was already too late.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_225.wav|85|So what could be better than becoming a captain?
DUMMY2/p318/p318_195.wav|19|They believed it worked.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_083.wav|64|All of us do.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_328.wav|101|It is just a tax on employment.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_023.wav|102|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_269.wav|74|That, though, is not true.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_257.wav|1|Last night, the centre issued a statement to the contrary.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_182.wav|28|It would be really interesting if they did.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_316.wav|75|These figures are truly awful.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_019.wav|29|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_329.wav|0|It's not an easy life.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_100.wav|96|It was mayhem.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_182.wav|22|I see social work as a vocation, a commitment.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_089.wav|72|My back is feeling really good.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_051.wav|89|It is bizarre.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_016.wav|106|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_011.wav|73|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_040.wav|0|It is difficult for Ali.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_224.wav|74|Our thoughts and prayers are with her family.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_130.wav|90|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_133.wav|26|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_244.wav|44|All were later allowed home.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_365.wav|31|Tell it like it was?
DUMMY2/p313/p313_037.wav|76|This was the performance, and the result they needed.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_343.wav|51|The event has now gone to Helsinki.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_218.wav|66|He doesn't like the Labour Party.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_418.wav|74|Are you watching Liverpool?
DUMMY2/p233/p233_187.wav|84|If that's the case, he will struggle.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_267.wav|42|When he came to see me on Monday.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_419.wav|98|Would he ever go back to the beginning?
DUMMY2/p268/p268_135.wav|87|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_365.wav|42|This kind of traffic is commonplace.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_152.wav|60|Our time is up.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_322.wav|2|Our message was inclusive.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_090.wav|106|The two clubs have agreed the transfer fee.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_271.wav|35|On the contrary they stand to gain.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_397.wav|65|It was either Wednesday or Thursday, he said.)
DUMMY2/p267/p267_187.wav|0|People will ask about us.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_099.wav|92|Mind you, it wouldn't be a bad idea.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_491.wav|24|IT HAS been the year of the youngster at Kilmarnock.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_360.wav|106|So what happens next ?
DUMMY2/p244/p244_049.wav|78|That is still the case.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_163.wav|94|This latter point is hugely important.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_392.wav|100|This remains the party's policy.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_336.wav|73|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_273.wav|77|was everything done to save people ?
DUMMY2/p280/p280_403.wav|52|These old songs are very nice to play.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_156.wav|98|We have waited a long time for this.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_067.wav|34|Most of the others were in their twenties.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_124.wav|90|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_003.wav|78|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_089.wav|5|As, indeed, they would be.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_460.wav|50|A fatal accident inquiry is ongoing.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_173.wav|84|I have got a wife to feed.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_420.wav|50|Even if they come out playing a physical game, we can cope.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_091.wav|104|There's a strong involvement.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_413.wav|104|It is a delight on every level.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_342.wav|106|The company hopes to repeat the process in France.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_129.wav|35|This is a successful outcome.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_095.wav|75|I had a ball today.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_062.wav|14|Why do it otherwise ?)
DUMMY2/p255/p255_335.wav|31|They haven't got a hope.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_365.wav|99|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_266.wav|11|I am expecting to win.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_175.wav|5|The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_038.wav|104|Their ambition is to go back.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_306.wav|21|Strictly speaking, it shouldn't be like this.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_108.wav|70|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_198.wav|19|This is a really serious issue.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_081.wav|101|I had no intention of misleading anyone.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_341.wav|97|Sunday's game was not a trial.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_411.wav|72|But it was money well spent.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_355.wav|31|It was one in the afternoon.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_041.wav|31|But it might have done.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_084.wav|59|Now the system is right behind us.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_027.wav|34|It was a deeply moving musical experience.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_395.wav|6|Players are fighting to stay in the team.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_217.wav|42|Access has been a nightmare.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_373.wav|58|One policeman was killed.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_355.wav|82|Everything is up for grabs.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_138.wav|76|Receiving this medal is an honour.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_102.wav|91|I am sure all schools would accept that.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_165.wav|102|Playing in Europe is the benchmark.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_155.wav|12|You've seen the polls then, Sean.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_017.wav|18|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_195.wav|42|Scots actors should be so lucky.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_301.wav|19|They were going through the motions, but that's about all.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_325.wav|85|It is a good result for Great Britain.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_226.wav|33|Perhaps it was just as well.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_398.wav|68|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_321.wav|96|Davis is very supportive, as a director.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_048.wav|55|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_407.wav|24|My immune system had been depleted.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_301.wav|100|This will help our confidence.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_186.wav|11|No-one has ever seen inside.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_088.wav|84|Do I have a favourite ?
DUMMY2/p236/p236_245.wav|75|Truth is the child of time.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_154.wav|60|But other Ministers are not convinced.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_413.wav|48|We have no information on Iraq.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_071.wav|89|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_344.wav|40|There may be reasons for it.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_177.wav|20|As we worked.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_380.wav|94|They play together perfectly.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_174.wav|7|Adventure is the champagne of life.)
DUMMY2/p318/p318_098.wav|19|Peter doesn't want to leave.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_114.wav|103|His three-year appointment begins on Monday.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_359.wav|13|There's no choice is there?
DUMMY2/p282/p282_078.wav|83|The party is up for it.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_320.wav|77|And he goes with it.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_011.wav|20|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_241.wav|65|He has been chosen as captain because of the person he is.)
DUMMY2/p293/p293_105.wav|23|I have also been delighted with Stevie.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_319.wav|36|This may be perfectly innocent.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_311.wav|93|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_073.wav|68|Two people are allowed to share the duty.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_242.wav|98|The English are coming.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_082.wav|38|So we said, no, we're not going to do that.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_344.wav|105|I wanted to go out on a high.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_029.wav|68|I was never going to play against Scotland.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_200.wav|100|I made a terrible start.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_232.wav|31|We played them off the pitch.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_032.wav|64|There are moments of silence.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_274.wav|75|He will go on the bench.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_289.wav|93|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_276.wav|14|Scoring in our first game was a bonus for me.)
DUMMY2/p237/p237_018.wav|61|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by the reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_297.wav|105|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_027.wav|70|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_076.wav|59|I'd like to continue that record.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_323.wav|96|I came into this world with nothing.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_074.wav|94|Both sides have been hit by injury.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_321.wav|81|We have got to get the points from this one.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_164.wav|99|I was in the train station overnight.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_032.wav|78|The end result is the same.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_309.wav|43|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_030.wav|106|They might have asked, for goodness sake.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_383.wav|91|Where was their passion, the power, the feeling?
DUMMY2/p374/p374_211.wav|11|Stan is a vital part of our future.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_159.wav|14|I have a kind of love affair with Hollywood.)
DUMMY2/p269/p269_103.wav|94|But they did not even get a reply to their letter.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_133.wav|11|Players want to know what is on offer.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_278.wav|83|You've got to have both sides.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_130.wav|23|They have their own interests and techniques.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_400.wav|54|A review group will report on Tuesday.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_077.wav|104|It will not be a long campaign.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_388.wav|21|My wife and family are the support system.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_128.wav|12|She says the royal family get on well.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_447.wav|39|I believed that effort was needed in our own area.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_025.wav|69|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_132.wav|59|They did very well.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_090.wav|77|Two of the team became ill.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_411.wav|26|I believe the gap is nearly there.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_169.wav|20|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_016.wav|40|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_311.wav|31|It's about my time as a guitarist.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_395.wav|37|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_233.wav|5|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_425.wav|65|Those overseas offices were great.)
DUMMY2/p343/p343_233.wav|21|We could learn a lot from them.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_011.wav|91|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_014.wav|55|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_058.wav|53|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_150.wav|36|It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_409.wav|7|Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.)
DUMMY2/p362/p362_213.wav|15|I think that's a bit of an invasion.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_376.wav|11|I want to get at the truth.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_053.wav|82|I could never be cool.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_262.wav|76|Every school in Scotland should be excellent.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_333.wav|11|What is that?
DUMMY2/p255/p255_102.wav|31|Scotland were beaten again.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_238.wav|11|Jackson may well be right.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_357.wav|75|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_169.wav|5|As we worked.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_376.wav|75|All would be under threat.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_401.wav|27|I never won a penny throughout my career.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_079.wav|44|She had travelled to Spain to give evidence.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_221.wav|30|They make it look very easy.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_097.wav|106|We are talking about the outskirts of London.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_312.wav|13|Friends of the family have given their support.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_039.wav|63|The staff are as good as any staff in the city.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_378.wav|78|I was delighted to accept.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_291.wav|38|We haven't actually considered it down here.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_197.wav|2|We live by the rule of law.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_261.wav|69|The system can work.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_392.wav|104|My mind was made up.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_304.wav|33|He should have won.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_110.wav|107|I hope they understand that.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_250.wav|99|It was a hit.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_029.wav|17|Did you see that?
DUMMY2/p299/p299_206.wav|58|The budget was too low for that.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_055.wav|97|New potential dangers were emerging.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_357.wav|68|I would urge the Government to think again.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_391.wav|69|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_157.wav|64|But he is not using them.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_065.wav|100|It's not covered by the insurance.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_117.wav|41|We need to handle it.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_127.wav|92|Sure, we have problems.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_300.wav|60|Is it all real?
DUMMY2/p287/p287_048.wav|77|The teacher would have approved.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_400.wav|96|It will probably take me just days to spend it.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_254.wav|25|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_050.wav|85|I would love to have him home.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_286.wav|48|Aberdeen had little to offer.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_287.wav|23|They certainly do not socialise.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_171.wav|16|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_064.wav|3|It was an amazing result.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_380.wav|46|It's not just for classical music.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_042.wav|3|He was in his element.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_314.wav|70|It will work.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_211.wav|29|Does the name matter ?
DUMMY2/p300/p300_333.wav|102|There has been no cover-up - just the opposite in fact.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_087.wav|82|They should come clean.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_061.wav|22|That is why we want this decision reversed.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_221.wav|77|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_162.wav|103|Sadly, the game will never see his like again.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_353.wav|104|They had to explain it.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_121.wav|60|They will run a mile.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_247.wav|35|Hospitals are for the ill.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_364.wav|20|Not so, it seems.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_315.wav|50|Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_280.wav|57|We want to see the maximum of change.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_087.wav|53|I have no problems playing with such capable players in front of me.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_202.wav|80|It is a case of taking a risk.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_287.wav|16|Bombing slaughter rejected
DUMMY2/p266/p266_314.wav|20|I will not allow the destruction of the Scottish fishing industry.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_395.wav|11|I just don't know what she was doing.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_332.wav|92|I'm sure that they will learn.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_214.wav|72|I have learned from him.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_169.wav|16|Is Saddam a threat?
DUMMY2/p228/p228_296.wav|57|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_422.wav|64|It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_094.wav|10|In the end we made too many errors.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_231.wav|102|We have tried to keep his head up.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_169.wav|101|Irvine said his company was intent on supporting the Scottish dairy industry.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_197.wav|13|This is my homeland.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_330.wav|89|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_296.wav|9|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_417.wav|16|The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_321.wav|79|You have to be realistic.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_022.wav|68|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_119.wav|64|We must improve our relations with government.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_074.wav|33|There may be some work in construction, but not enough.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_354.wav|11|Clark is back on top form.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_140.wav|80|I was the last man to touch the ball.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_397.wav|33|They would have been forgiven for doing so.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_376.wav|106|This is the version which appeared in our paper.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_046.wav|6|That is good news.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_204.wav|95|I think, therefore I am ?
DUMMY2/p283/p283_065.wav|95|I expect a rapid response.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_086.wav|95|It looks like a hit.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_349.wav|7|The party lasted all night.)
DUMMY2/p292/p292_292.wav|13|Spent three months alone at sea.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_355.wav|23|But it can happen for Tiger.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_254.wav|95|Our future is in their hands.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_398.wav|23|Their bid was a very good one.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_409.wav|72|We are not too surprised.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_158.wav|43|We will turn the corner.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_056.wav|51|Sub Not Used, MacKay.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_041.wav|48|Has the conflict started ?
DUMMY2/p302/p302_198.wav|30|This must be kept in total perspective.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_424.wav|19|We have no plans for direct action.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_005.wav|10|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_225.wav|44|It did my image a lot of good!
DUMMY2/p347/p347_212.wav|46|I've invented a village in East Lothian.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_038.wav|84|Victory was never in doubt.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_370.wav|46|It's an internal matter.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_201.wav|76|I'm just looking to take my chances.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_339.wav|54|This time, there were no such rewards.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_029.wav|33|It is my fault.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_461.wav|89|I am greatly relieved that the trust has reached its target.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_371.wav|104|We recorded it at our own expense.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_378.wav|98|In fact, he should never have been in the field.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_208.wav|76|It was good to score the goal today.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_182.wav|18|You'll find out on Saturday.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_135.wav|25|The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_234.wav|67|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_333.wav|98|He pretended not to care.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_347.wav|100|However, Walker remains determined to fight the proposals.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_414.wav|22|Now you see him, now you don't.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_309.wav|34|I don't want to hear any excuses.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_218.wav|24|It carried a double message.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_013.wav|25|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_029.wav|16|They have no history.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_408.wav|14|But they can also be managed by telephone.)
DUMMY2/p271/p271_382.wav|27|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_086.wav|73|They are now divorced.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_023.wav|99|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_292.wav|24|Companies have only recently been allowed to compete on price.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_341.wav|29|I am not obsessed with sex.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_347.wav|85|People are using it in their daily lives.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_270.wav|79|Full back was a bit of the unknown.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_376.wav|72|They say they feel different.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_058.wav|92|A formal decision will be announced within months.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_421.wav|85|The British government said she was coming home.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_158.wav|94|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_053.wav|19|It was large enough to fit the wall.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_050.wav|78|At the moment, we do not know the extent of their injuries.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_390.wav|36|We have to reinforce the pressure on Iraq.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_225.wav|26|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_084.wav|27|A play is a set of actions.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_059.wav|49|I've learned a lot, and tomorrow is another day.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_308.wav|53|Further heavy charges are expected this year.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_298.wav|42|After that, we made some changes.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_011.wav|64|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_033.wav|80|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_379.wav|36|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_406.wav|16|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_366.wav|21|Surely they were on a hiding to nothing.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_090.wav|52|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_337.wav|65|The regional government faces key elections next May.)
DUMMY2/p334/p334_003.wav|38|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_331.wav|63|Investors can be forgiven for caution.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_271.wav|41|We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_334.wav|95|In Europe, it is always over two games.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_262.wav|49|Intensive care has been very busy.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_157.wav|4|He was part of South Africa.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_049.wav|15|They finished second and third.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_288.wav|77|It was never a free kick.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_036.wav|16|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_154.wav|21|It's like a garage.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_068.wav|65|That is not possible.)
DUMMY2/p360/p360_012.wav|60|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_095.wav|26|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_315.wav|21|I cannot say too much about them.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_120.wav|82|Neither of them was badly hurt.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_165.wav|26|That will do for me.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_184.wav|61|This is a sad day.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_165.wav|68|It is quite an eye opener.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_230.wav|87|That proved enough to settle the home side down.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_234.wav|65|However, there is an issue, isn't there?)
DUMMY2/p364/p364_235.wav|88|They were assured that it would.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_123.wav|74|Yes, we can beat them.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_256.wav|18|He is due in Israel tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_324.wav|15|I think she was right.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_078.wav|82|I have nothing to lose.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_329.wav|31|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_151.wav|43|We have seen a copy of the report.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_253.wav|88|But this is just the first step.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_001.wav|9|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_272.wav|6|We're going to fight it.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_246.wav|38|He was to get his chance.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_107.wav|80|He is hungry for success and I am the same.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_120.wav|84|I'm delighted about that.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_347.wav|97|We don't believe anything anymore.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_021.wav|95|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_275.wav|31|He was popular.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_117.wav|16|It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_413.wav|13|The balance is all wrong in this country.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_157.wav|75|I'm afraid to say anything.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_018.wav|19|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_079.wav|37|But the organisers refused to worry.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_088.wav|27|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_306.wav|42|Glasgow is a tour de force.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_295.wav|38|We were given a warm and friendly reception.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_086.wav|41|Is there a new way forward?
DUMMY2/p294/p294_056.wav|104|This is a possible way forward.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_014.wav|83|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_422.wav|74|Our policy is already working well.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_060.wav|18|But what did it matter?
DUMMY2/p252/p252_063.wav|55|It was dangerous but vital employment.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_377.wav|45|Mentally, you have to be tough.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_303.wav|47|We believe the world has too many refugees already.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_327.wav|15|I'd like to continue that record.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_121.wav|53|They have no real friends in the region.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_238.wav|41|But it's a subtle process.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_198.wav|59|It's been a good year.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_037.wav|58|Ministers received the report with frosty reticence.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_059.wav|35|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_079.wav|86|This is the way things should be handled.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_224.wav|66|Scottish public finances emerge from this review enhanced.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_207.wav|50|You've caught a serial killer.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_311.wav|68|That was moving the goalposts.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_269.wav|15|He is an excellent defender, strong and quick.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_294.wav|104|What do they do, anyway?
DUMMY2/p276/p276_152.wav|106|Why change it ?
DUMMY2/p282/p282_358.wav|83|He could make it.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_252.wav|26|He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_354.wav|18|This is a really serious issue.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_136.wav|75|But the main thing will be to avoid the bunkers.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_303.wav|48|The early goal was a shock to the system for Hearts.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_324.wav|92|It will not work in our favour.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_225.wav|13|He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_271.wav|91|Bombing is the easy option.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_233.wav|99|It is set in Paris.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_005.wav|105|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_004.wav|89|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_252.wav|50|But they were never expected to last.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_039.wav|12|A further police inquiry is currently being held.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_068.wav|45|It's all I can do.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_399.wav|58|Scotland is losing business.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_026.wav|64|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_274.wav|92|The overall effect is impressive, but distancing.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_294.wav|102|In the old days, it was easy.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_072.wav|101|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
DUMMY2/p236/p236_222.wav|75|It was worth a photograph.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_112.wav|47|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_273.wav|45|Things can change.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_048.wav|24|Do I have a favourite ?
DUMMY2/p261/p261_337.wav|100|There is a handful of rewarding paintings.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_124.wav|92|It is, however, an unlikely outcome.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_296.wav|69|They are wrong.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_336.wav|1|Will he be given time?
DUMMY2/p247/p247_187.wav|14|I'm just going to hit the shot.)
DUMMY2/p275/p275_400.wav|40|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_291.wav|92|Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_356.wav|7|Other people had looked at it.)
DUMMY2/p363/p363_268.wav|6|The test case is still awaiting action.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_350.wav|3|Overall, we continue to look to the future with confidence.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_049.wav|14|Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.)
DUMMY2/p230/p230_161.wav|35|Are you from the rugby ?
DUMMY2/p314/p314_330.wav|51|But he is revelling in the big stage.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_049.wav|72|I hadn't been looking after myself.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_344.wav|49|They are the heroes.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_192.wav|35|We always felt we could win.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_346.wav|40|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_183.wav|38|That is his attitude to things.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_141.wav|65|That comes at a cost.)
DUMMY2/p280/p280_184.wav|52|We have come a long way since then.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_193.wav|98|This is the start of a slippery slope.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_145.wav|40|Who would be right?
DUMMY2/p269/p269_082.wav|94|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_182.wav|42|Others may be trying to catch up.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_399.wav|47|He's already made history.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_102.wav|95|The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_228.wav|87|There's always the next century.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_083.wav|86|Nothing is yet confirmed.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_057.wav|39|It will now take over the running of the estate.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_410.wav|92|To me, it was just a miracle.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_084.wav|80|I've not thought about it.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_315.wav|90|They were fantastic.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_042.wav|36|I am just going to go for it.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_352.wav|107|His replacement was named yesterday, following inquiries by The Herald.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_327.wav|7|I will never change our policy on paying appearance money.)
DUMMY2/p244/p244_103.wav|78|The door is still open, but we need a bit of help.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_327.wav|107|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_301.wav|45|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_417.wav|1|O Leary now intends to take a holiday.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_286.wav|64|That's why he plays for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_141.wav|16|That group reported just before Christmas.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_147.wav|10|There's always the next century.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_041.wav|88|We welcome the ministers decision.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_117.wav|6|These people are helpless.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_264.wav|44|Our idea is to make it entirely Irish.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_030.wav|105|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_282.wav|89|It was good.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_084.wav|45|That will come after the game on Saturday.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_256.wav|43|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_421.wav|105|It is marvellous.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_207.wav|62|Let us hope so.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_136.wav|3|So, did she meet him ?
DUMMY2/p292/p292_156.wav|13|If only the acting profession was that simple.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_270.wav|75|But they were never expected to last.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_443.wav|100|It is a case of pity for us.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_053.wav|71|"However, he will now have to wait for his chance to impress."
DUMMY2/p267/p267_161.wav|0|So what is the campaign about ?
DUMMY2/p236/p236_246.wav|75|And they were being paid ?
DUMMY2/p308/p308_177.wav|107|His name is Michael Owen.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_165.wav|2|Tell it like it was?
DUMMY2/p230/p230_372.wav|35|This is a major championship.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_176.wav|106|It took five months to repair the damage.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_115.wav|35|I can't even get into the A team.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_340.wav|79|They are used to it.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_093.wav|64|It is not true to Hollywood, nor The Player.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_242.wav|10|This would include the GM food industry.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_156.wav|27|Work has started.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_176.wav|22|That will be the sweetness.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_194.wav|37|He has had success at every level.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_190.wav|27|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_060.wav|60|But there is no easy option.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_065.wav|59|The script was funny.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_295.wav|107|We work on the same level.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_222.wav|107|It was a total surprise.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_114.wav|66|He had a heart problem.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_211.wav|98|And how much of a compliment is that?
DUMMY2/p248/p248_279.wav|99|You've got to have both sides.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_235.wav|1|That is the first thing we need.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_183.wav|19|I didn't want to ignore the punters.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_411.wav|33|You need a licence to run a pub.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_118.wav|4|It is already making a difference.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_447.wav|75|Phil Mickelson did that last year.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_091.wav|74|It could be to do with the location.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_345.wav|4|I feel it's time to make the switch.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_134.wav|97|We took the chances when they came.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_379.wav|35|We will win the argument.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_287.wav|6|I believe he could have turned it around.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_064.wav|6|The club is afflicted by injuries.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_076.wav|49|He had a moustache.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_144.wav|81|Note the date.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_187.wav|98|Cloning is not ready.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_062.wav|46|The message is just not getting through.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_167.wav|79|The omens are not good.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_198.wav|58|I feel privileged to be here.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_123.wav|38|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_268.wav|60|There was no let-up for the minnows.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_269.wav|32|No production contract is yet in sight.)
DUMMY2/p330/p330_369.wav|1|We know them as mobile telephones.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_079.wav|31|He is driven.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_115.wav|66|The breakdown was much later in her life.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_089.wav|7|What do we do ?)
DUMMY2/p308/p308_283.wav|107|Do yourselves a favour.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_014.wav|56|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_244.wav|53|how do you get it back ?
DUMMY2/p374/p374_001.wav|11|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_404.wav|75|I remain a buyer of the shares.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_295.wav|5|Bombing slaughter rejected
DUMMY2/p278/p278_081.wav|10|That was a great performance by the team.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_031.wav|39|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_364.wav|16|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_282.wav|67|They were on holiday in Egypt.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_155.wav|47|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_122.wav|88|This decision is a victory for common sense.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_124.wav|102|I'm sure this game will be equally successful.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_314.wav|56|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_087.wav|19|Dunfermline deserved a goal for their hard work.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_100.wav|34|But he is something special, is he not?
DUMMY2/p238/p238_341.wav|37|Dancing will help his ankles and his feet.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_387.wav|76|Sure, we have problems.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_347.wav|103|Clearly, it is time to meet this young man.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_013.wav|96|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_160.wav|103|For a moment it was all about her.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_328.wav|74|And the audience is a surprise.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_175.wav|12|You cannot eat in the dining room.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_179.wav|32|What was the matter for concern ?)
DUMMY2/p374/p374_126.wav|11|They went to the press.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_161.wav|75|It is not a financial issue.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_428.wav|89|It was a lot of hard work, but it wasn't difficult.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_117.wav|57|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_268.wav|103|Now that was a boxing movie.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_135.wav|38|I've no doubt about it, it was actually from her.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_374.wav|75|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_150.wav|4|The money is not really our concern.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_282.wav|91|The police have an awful lot to explain.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_283.wav|21|It may take time to get it back.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_034.wav|33|Teachers have been given the offer.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_073.wav|0|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_367.wav|74|I love it here.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_456.wav|32|They offer a kind of narrative.)
DUMMY2/p308/p308_394.wav|107|His condition was stable last night.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_158.wav|23|Last night, the extent of the damage was emerging.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_256.wav|31|There's the mix.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_096.wav|86|The peace process will be buried!
DUMMY2/p361/p361_358.wav|79|If only it had been.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_182.wav|48|Do you think we are a top nation ?
DUMMY2/p347/p347_255.wav|46|The New Deal will constantly be improved.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_186.wav|66|Promises were not kept.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_379.wav|51|There were three boys and two girls.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_043.wav|99|It was ugly.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_199.wav|82|I know my sons.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_272.wav|37|Her political persuasion is no secret.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_004.wav|14|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  )
DUMMY2/p282/p282_066.wav|83|This is the first step.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_035.wav|42|The defender should have won the bloody ba.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_005.wav|34|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_262.wav|88|It would be a bonus for this game.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_327.wav|76|Medical staff are with them at the moment.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_195.wav|29|I'm interested in interesting work.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_358.wav|75|Like his acting, it was an accident.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_219.wav|1|Last night, she refused to comment on the accident.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_407.wav|91|My thoughts are with their families.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_191.wav|63|Our destiny is in our own hands.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_245.wav|50|You can feel at home in China.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_389.wav|24|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
DUMMY2/p314/p314_280.wav|51|This is my home town.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_211.wav|102|He ended up a headmaster.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_334.wav|46|That is as it may be.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_046.wav|52|How do you take them away ?
DUMMY2/p270/p270_266.wav|8|We accept the new rules.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_096.wav|36|But I know the course.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_156.wav|55|Who was she ?
DUMMY2/p279/p279_375.wav|25|YOU thought it was a headache.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_320.wav|97|Central to their cause was Barry Nicholson.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_444.wav|48|Any error is severely punished.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_288.wav|41|He will address the nation this evening.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_033.wav|90|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_152.wav|44|Who would take it now, after all this?
DUMMY2/p274/p274_398.wav|32|Finally, he paid for the movie.)
DUMMY2/p311/p311_204.wav|4|I'm very frightened of the dark.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_093.wav|53|They had the appeal of TV stars.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_128.wav|13|Scotland, is an increasing concern for young people.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_235.wav|36|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_095.wav|14|Potions said he would drive.)
DUMMY2/p343/p343_253.wav|21|There were too many mistakes.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_394.wav|72|He just attracted people.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_268.wav|86|And Michael was just great.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_195.wav|43|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_341.wav|87|We used to live with dignity in our country.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_231.wav|5|But you think I'm going to argue with the big man?
DUMMY2/p298/p298_191.wav|68|The rear of the plane was on fire.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_383.wav|1|But, because of the wood, no-one had the experience.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_307.wav|36|We need to increase the membership.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_074.wav|96|Then followed a bout of flu.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_136.wav|51|Folk music is in her blood.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_020.wav|38|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_225.wav|89|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_410.wav|37|But nothing could be done.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_059.wav|17|This is the band.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_048.wav|37|Among them are many criminals.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_188.wav|52|I didn't miss the big house at all.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_034.wav|28|At least two women were among those arrested.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_025.wav|106|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
DUMMY2/p334/p334_202.wav|38|We welcome this increase in the minimum wage.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_282.wav|73|Who did the recruiting?
DUMMY2/p283/p283_405.wav|95|There is a lack of logic.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_065.wav|92|Can you imagine a world without design?
DUMMY2/p330/p330_187.wav|1|He went to see what he could learn.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_065.wav|81|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_186.wav|12|A bit of match fitness is required.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_293.wav|6|They think that it matters but it doesn't.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_016.wav|93|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_309.wav|92|They told him to go to drama school.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_356.wav|42|The course record was in his name.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_330.wav|78|And we can do it.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_447.wav|106|We go there with confidence.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_289.wav|73|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_323.wav|18|It wasn't the issue.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_448.wav|95|Sentiment was helped by the sharp fall in debt.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_069.wav|43|I've spent a lot of time on buses.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_314.wav|0|I will not be afraid.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_048.wav|27|He is too weak to move.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_424.wav|40|We are now up against it.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_124.wav|63|I will never change our policy on paying appearance money.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_036.wav|70|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_114.wav|6|I hope the couples are still together.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_200.wav|72|This guy is amazing.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_094.wav|0|It's not a lack of effort.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_150.wav|26|Neither side can win this war.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_410.wav|14|The casualties were not named.)
DUMMY2/p279/p279_338.wav|25|Alex Ferguson is the same.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_133.wav|101|I think he's the favourite.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_384.wav|106|But the rally was short-lived.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_010.wav|73|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_016.wav|48|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_270.wav|93|It looks as though he will be right.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_422.wav|36|In time, may prove a worthy successor to Billy Dodds.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_398.wav|63|The ethos of the school was outstanding.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_251.wav|10|There were no reports of casualties.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_301.wav|78|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_330.wav|16|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_053.wav|66|It's to do with play.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_182.wav|64|It's a flourishing and beautiful city.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_235.wav|33|I am very, very happy.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_197.wav|96|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_155.wav|107|We did not want an absentee landlord.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_042.wav|75|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_309.wav|68|No-one, not even the Scottish Arts Council, was interested in her.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_396.wav|79|They thought they couldn't get any.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_193.wav|9|The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_355.wav|47|The pressure is on Celtic in the main.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_399.wav|69|Is that possible?
DUMMY2/p285/p285_149.wav|2|She had gone to the Catholic school.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_378.wav|16|There is no signature.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_315.wav|7|It's hard to see it.)
DUMMY2/p283/p283_263.wav|95|He does not much like the Liberal Democrats.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_134.wav|25|It will be too hot.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_227.wav|35|It was a day for records.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_354.wav|37|They're going to open in early summer.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_216.wav|50|I had decided to quit the show.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_068.wav|42|We will be paying agency rates.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_122.wav|49|I am not holding the club to ransom.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_151.wav|97|The driver escaped injury.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_015.wav|39|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_127.wav|82|Finding the answer is a hugely enjoyable experience.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_347.wav|80|It's all going to clear the debt.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_291.wav|11|It opened last month.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_086.wav|100|However, it did not end that way.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_148.wav|31|The idea is simple.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_028.wav|46|There are moments of silence.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_046.wav|107|He could face a jail sentence.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_019.wav|75|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_260.wav|102|He must have something up his sleeve.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_238.wav|45|He was good, but not that good.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_242.wav|59|It was a hit.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_069.wav|90|There was a battle there.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_032.wav|90|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_008.wav|36|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_019.wav|104|Since then physicists have found that it's not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_222.wav|97|But Harry has become a franchise.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_305.wav|92|Nobody will be forced to work.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_191.wav|49|It's hard, but if we don't do it, nobody will.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_274.wav|77|What was the matter for concern ?
DUMMY2/p326/p326_040.wav|28|The police believe the man was not injured.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_180.wav|5|They need to look after themselves.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_365.wav|53|Stephen has never considered the question of compensation.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_309.wav|7|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.)
DUMMY2/p306/p306_035.wav|12|Someone came down and said, Can you read a script?
DUMMY2/p299/p299_312.wav|58|Why should we have been asked to share?
DUMMY2/p278/p278_004.wav|10|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_377.wav|35|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_219.wav|89|At the time, he was a living legend.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_318.wav|15|It is good news for us.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_053.wav|65|It was dangerous but vital employment.)
DUMMY2/p266/p266_242.wav|20|We will need to study the report before any decision is taken.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_189.wav|65|They were certainly tough, but totally fair.)
DUMMY2/p361/p361_023.wav|79|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_252.wav|52|The rise has come too late for some.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_165.wav|79|He tells the truth and that's important.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_077.wav|33|Clearly it is very disturbing.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_282.wav|57|He was obviously very genuine.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_214.wav|102|David Murray, the Rangers chairman, also welcomed the scheme.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_046.wav|94|We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_418.wav|64|I'd just like to play.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_162.wav|71|"It was so new, so exciting."
DUMMY2/p257/p257_419.wav|105|It's not about defining styles.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_257.wav|9|Chambers said he would accept the place.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_256.wav|60|They were all on a mission.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_318.wav|21|We told them in August.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_166.wav|7|It was by the numbers.)
DUMMY2/p298/p298_286.wav|68|We have been treated with complete contempt.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_156.wav|54|Yesterday's performance was exactly that.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_044.wav|15|This is only one example.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_068.wav|107|YOU thought it was a headache.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_401.wav|77|Does it matter ?
DUMMY2/p246/p246_063.wav|5|He could make it.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_305.wav|90|It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_112.wav|36|The whole thing is the music.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_092.wav|1|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_226.wav|54|Appointments should be made on merit.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_329.wav|99|He has to learn.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_340.wav|91|Anyway, she is playing a lesbian.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_353.wav|21|It is safe in our hands.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_055.wav|44|But it obviously doesn't, so the government needs to intervene.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_132.wav|12|I've always been desperate to play this part.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_210.wav|106|This should begin in October.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_263.wav|71|"Similar measures are expected in England and Wales."
DUMMY2/p304/p304_093.wav|72|But we are losing that connection.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_263.wav|102|That means no more taxation by stealth.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_108.wav|82|Would you pay to come and see it?
DUMMY2/p307/p307_392.wav|22|Muslim leaders in Italy have denied the charge.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_088.wav|69|He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_098.wav|103|Sergio was talking his chances down yesterday.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_186.wav|13|We were a shambles at the back.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_310.wav|9|She said she could not believe that they had run away.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_044.wav|67|I was scared.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_146.wav|35|It was by the numbers.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_048.wav|78|In fact, they are the future of investment.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_120.wav|18|This is a disaster averted for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_311.wav|19|Could you put it in writing?
DUMMY2/p292/p292_153.wav|13|Other forces were, however, at work.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_091.wav|33|We have a rehearsal.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_242.wav|42|Dialogue is the key.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_253.wav|13|He is an excellent defender, strong and quick.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_111.wav|47|It would not do any harm to reinforce the message.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_146.wav|92|The jury is still out.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_244.wav|31|They had no children.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_273.wav|16|His place in central defence was taken by John Anderson.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_153.wav|80|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_145.wav|58|This has a number of benefits.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_258.wav|105|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_003.wav|37|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_029.wav|15|It was a fairy tale.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_221.wav|2|I am not ready for Lennox Lewis.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_242.wav|41|Chambers said he would accept the place.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_071.wav|16|He was at home with his pals.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_249.wav|21|It's still got that at its heart.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_101.wav|36|The following are the principal provisions.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_191.wav|100|That was the theory, anyway.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_029.wav|5|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_055.wav|30|The days of empty promises are over.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_419.wav|72|I can understand why they have gone.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_046.wav|39|That company should not be allowed to operate in this country.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_025.wav|15|We are being realistic about the challenges ahead.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_381.wav|104|It was very, very difficult for me to look at this.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_006.wav|17|When the sunlight strikes the raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_010.wav|90|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_164.wav|18|It would be very dangerous.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_021.wav|99|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_353.wav|49|Their condition was described as stable yesterday.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_135.wav|37|No one person or small group could be singled out.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_358.wav|11|It's for that reason he should resign.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_472.wav|14|And it covers the spectrum.)
DUMMY2/p266/p266_235.wav|20|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_041.wav|40|Dancing was her life.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_161.wav|43|These days are long gone.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_183.wav|96|Everyone can be bought.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_147.wav|53|You should feel involved in their lives.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_249.wav|25|There will be widespread support on all sides.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_067.wav|91|I want my country to be a republic, not an empire.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_231.wav|84|The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_231.wav|68|I fell in love with ballet.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_275.wav|38|We are on a four-year mission.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_044.wav|40|The shift in public perception about the disease is amazing.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_425.wav|27|He is to appeal.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_321.wav|17|But both were involved with other matters.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_164.wav|73|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_111.wav|89|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_227.wav|82|SCOTLAND has shown the way.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_384.wav|20|It's like a car crash.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_362.wav|83|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_206.wav|17|I think it's awful.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_296.wav|26|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_323.wav|77|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_075.wav|95|We will pay their bills.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_294.wav|88|When he got up he was hit again.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_378.wav|35|We are a Scottish company.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_380.wav|85|I have great confidence in Annabelle.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_220.wav|71|"At the time, he was a living legend."
DUMMY2/p247/p247_290.wav|14|The morale of the Yugoslav army is beginning to crack.)
DUMMY2/p284/p284_043.wav|16|We will push.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_363.wav|4|We would have concerns about that.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_135.wav|97|It is important that vital services are maintained.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_016.wav|73|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_257.wav|50|He admitted that he knew nothing about it.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_308.wav|57|This film will be totally awesome.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_145.wav|17|Is that too much to ask?
DUMMY2/p282/p282_175.wav|83|Blair's response was weak.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_047.wav|105|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_362.wav|20|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_014.wav|11|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_191.wav|76|We have understood the problems for some time.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_064.wav|101|It could take some time.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_198.wav|18|I have no problem with that.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_091.wav|83|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_107.wav|5|Is that right?
DUMMY2/p247/p247_089.wav|14|We feel very comfortable in this international environment.)
DUMMY2/p229/p229_202.wav|67|People will ask about us.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_065.wav|46|This is a big, big win.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_234.wav|37|There's always the next century.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_338.wav|21|He didn't let me down.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_367.wav|35|But BA said the prediction was premature.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_128.wav|83|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_162.wav|39|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_198.wav|97|Three years probation is just a joke.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_371.wav|26|He could make it.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_183.wav|53|The answer I hope includes the Government - Holyrood and Westminster.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_344.wav|32|No one wants a dispute.)
DUMMY2/p257/p257_395.wav|105|I believe the gap is nearly there.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_203.wav|76|This is not a European Army.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_194.wav|48|Such an appointment could go some way to reassure investors.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_282.wav|58|But when he left, the decision was forced upon us.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_075.wav|86|It is a job creation scheme.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_327.wav|95|Is there a waiting list ?
DUMMY2/p276/p276_294.wav|106|Bobby Williamson has been brilliant.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_231.wav|28|They made it very difficult for us.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_163.wav|95|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_361.wav|29|A report is expected next month.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_070.wav|5|It is a job creation scheme.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_326.wav|14|I thought his speech was a disgrace.)
DUMMY2/p351/p351_208.wav|33|They are not a set of options.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_060.wav|93|That's the truth.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_378.wav|55|The referee faces a massive job.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_022.wav|52|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_299.wav|41|It is a road of death.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_420.wav|40|Nine days later, he suffered another attack.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_153.wav|21|Only one got through.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_378.wav|10|That is a break with tradition.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_071.wav|17|Sub Not Used, McKenzie.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_120.wav|35|They are very happy with the new settlement.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_064.wav|0|How are you, sir ?
DUMMY2/p239/p239_290.wav|48|It was a pre-emptive strike.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_282.wav|63|That will be a problem for later.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_123.wav|88|One is too many.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_273.wav|13|The issues are very intense.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_216.wav|87|The music is therefore profoundly subversive.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_135.wav|13|The plane was in flames
DUMMY2/p281/p281_398.wav|36|He had returned to die.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_122.wav|74|My body is clearly capable.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_381.wav|95|Had this been common practice ?
DUMMY2/p240/p240_137.wav|93|He was in a great deal of pain.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_210.wav|40|You have a plan?
DUMMY2/p238/p238_001.wav|37|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_165.wav|44|It is quite an eye opener.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_164.wav|77|What happened in that game ?
DUMMY2/p257/p257_377.wav|105|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_258.wav|60|You will gain from that.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_081.wav|1|An announcement will follow in due course.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_236.wav|31|It's like a basketball.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_209.wav|71|"He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland."
DUMMY2/p226/p226_048.wav|43|It's a blessing.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_311.wav|63|We would hope to make progress on that next year.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_086.wav|106|But the organisers refused to worry.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_191.wav|93|The procedure is the same in all cases.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_359.wav|76|The hotel was huge.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_061.wav|69|Next league matches Celtic.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_101.wav|83|Tomorrow he will make a keynote speech on Europe.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_204.wav|37|How independent is that ?
DUMMY2/p297/p297_342.wav|42|Don't hold your breath.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_192.wav|6|Gary Parker is a favourite of mine.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_184.wav|81|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_171.wav|12|We want to help them through it.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_392.wav|55|The property is owned by Glasgow City Council.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_112.wav|29|It has removed a bit of guilt.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_397.wav|52|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_125.wav|26|So the European elections are extremely important.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_245.wav|98|Only four of his passengers were uninjured.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_171.wav|43|A helpline number is published at the end of this article.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_070.wav|22|When he took over it really took off.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_007.wav|10|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_261.wav|5|Souter will be back.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_234.wav|62|It was worth the wait.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_332.wav|80|Who will do it?
DUMMY2/p288/p288_031.wav|47|It is a case of taking a risk.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_317.wav|39|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_017.wav|2|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_068.wav|23|It felt like my support system was leaving.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_371.wav|100|He did a good job.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_233.wav|77|This is a family club.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_408.wav|60|What was all that about?
DUMMY2/p336/p336_071.wav|98|The hearing was continued until a later date.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_116.wav|58|The next few months will tell.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_029.wav|51|Four other charges were dropped.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_009.wav|28|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_381.wav|24|It's as wide as a church in here.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_304.wav|51|This club have been fair to me.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_382.wav|76|As it was a double, it was pretty expensive.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_289.wav|31|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_282.wav|11|He did very well, but didn't win.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_405.wav|69|It is an absolute nonsense.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_225.wav|74|You have to keep it on the fairways.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_487.wav|65|Her father wasn't best pleased.)
DUMMY2/p236/p236_191.wav|75|Each case is treated on merit.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_249.wav|2|There's the mix.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_032.wav|88|It is not a matter of concern.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_183.wav|16|Our team is just so young.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_379.wav|32|Scrutiny by the European Parliament is limited.)
DUMMY2/p228/p228_244.wav|57|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_228.wav|85|In hindsight, it was the wrong decision.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_159.wav|39|Like the others, he was arrested.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_373.wav|40|Something is wrong.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_138.wav|88|It's not their fault.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_085.wav|65|We're at home, which is important.)
DUMMY2/p245/p245_088.wav|59|Then came the crunch.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_091.wav|32|That will bring about a dramatic improvement.)
DUMMY2/p298/p298_375.wav|68|It's good news and long overdue.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_390.wav|8|Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_120.wav|77|You are a gambling man.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_253.wav|60|I didn't see the point.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_104.wav|12|After all, he is the King of Scotland.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_215.wav|94|I began to pray.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_387.wav|22|They want to avoid a flashpoint.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_409.wav|104|Such is the ego involved.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_114.wav|3|People have been placed in a state of alarm.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_319.wav|94|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_313.wav|51|The record companies have gone through the floor.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_369.wav|64|I felt we had fallen back a little.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_056.wav|47|That's the truth.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_407.wav|48|Calvin was always recognised as a player with potential.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_063.wav|44|That is a mark of what you are.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_138.wav|83|I was dead.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_001.wav|85|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_276.wav|29|I told you I was ill.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_171.wav|36|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_057.wav|36|There will be no repeat of that performance, that I can guarantee.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_435.wav|65|It all came good.)
DUMMY2/p267/p267_007.wav|0|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_006.wav|44|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_208.wav|91|We have no choice but to shut down.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_090.wav|41|Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_052.wav|8|Is it worth it ?
DUMMY2/p297/p297_386.wav|42|We've been calling for a level playing field.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_232.wav|34|The conference will run from Wednesday until Sunday.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_057.wav|22|I keep my fingers crossed.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_426.wav|75|Everything in golf is a balance.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_041.wav|85|There is a new confidence about the club.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_385.wav|21|It almost certainly is.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_177.wav|11|The Government has to grasp the nettle.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_213.wav|90|The second is the reaction of the Hibs fans.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_054.wav|1|Any error of judgment was ruled out.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_020.wav|36|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_349.wav|3|We are not interested in dividends.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_334.wav|59|I reminded myself that we were not talking about a death.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_427.wav|36|It was a poor performance.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_261.wav|96|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_423.wav|95|I was pleased with my own game.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_238.wav|20|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_211.wav|100|I chose to go by the rules.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_042.wav|11|YOU thought it was a headache.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_145.wav|91|It is patently true.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_369.wav|15|We thought we were looking in good shape.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_341.wav|2|I will miss him.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_015.wav|28|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_236.wav|59|You can feel at home in China.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_074.wav|22|The next thing will be cutting journey times.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_261.wav|6|They may not always be so lucky.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_214.wav|97|She died in middle age.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_092.wav|7|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.)
DUMMY2/p333/p333_256.wav|64|We started from scratch.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_129.wav|22|We now have to concentrate on the league.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_386.wav|68|This is a long-term discussion paper.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_270.wav|31|He thought he had a month to cross the street.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_268.wav|55|But the next day she paid for it.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_116.wav|55|They need the money.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_273.wav|29|No production contract is yet in sight.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_199.wav|55|And they were being paid ?
DUMMY2/p250/p250_273.wav|24|There will be widespread support on all sides.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_245.wav|22|Which perhaps is just as well.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_158.wav|20|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_230.wav|80|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_357.wav|81|I first met him last summer.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_303.wav|88|It was then that Rangers scored.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_115.wav|17|There is no guarantee.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_244.wav|55|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_078.wav|57|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_075.wav|87|Let's hope that it does.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_321.wav|104|We know we have done wrong.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_032.wav|94|Because we do not need it.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_047.wav|72|It is not about changing our image.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_100.wav|18|He is a one-off.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_203.wav|41|But I am a worried man.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_187.wav|96|I've been there.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_331.wav|57|He has to learn.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_038.wav|69|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_149.wav|58|To which the only answer is, don't hold your breath.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_194.wav|85|The home side didn't stand a chance.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_344.wav|44|Obviously, someone is not doing their job properly.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_159.wav|28|This meeting is the path to salvation.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_005.wav|7|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. )
DUMMY2/p308/p308_339.wav|107|ADVENTURE is the champagne of life.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_286.wav|8|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_219.wav|106|What are you not good at ?
DUMMY2/p251/p251_032.wav|9|It's a matter of balance.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_398.wav|22|What other retailer would do this?
DUMMY2/p261/p261_340.wav|100|Are they free ?
DUMMY2/p241/p241_125.wav|86|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_095.wav|0|That means an extra two years.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_239.wav|3|However, it is not as simple as this.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_388.wav|64|They could take the result away from them, couldn't they.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_247.wav|74|They deserved to beat us in the replay.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_359.wav|0|We live on an island.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_026.wav|15|This is your country.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_117.wav|9|Does this mean.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_369.wav|51|It looks like paradise.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_274.wav|79|So was the first half.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_441.wav|14|There is no hiding place.)
DUMMY2/p240/p240_102.wav|93|He takes the job.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_420.wav|92|But, of course, it isn't.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_007.wav|65|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. )
DUMMY2/p362/p362_246.wav|15|He said nothing of the sort.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_110.wav|21|It's up to them to decide.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_349.wav|5|You must have a government and a good civil service.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_215.wav|4|It wouldn't go off.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_022.wav|2|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_393.wav|75|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_039.wav|64|His views are hardly surprising.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_108.wav|90|We have every respect for Michelle.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_406.wav|6|I'm not allowed to speak to anyone.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_404.wav|22|He is very popular in the squad, in England, and abroad.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_086.wav|63|We have to offer value for money.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_186.wav|91|The early evidence suggests he did not.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_037.wav|71|"He has not been named."
DUMMY2/p279/p279_169.wav|25|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_015.wav|54|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_019.wav|33|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_422.wav|18|There is no shortage of questions.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_093.wav|15|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_088.wav|15|They could not have done more for me.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_127.wav|100|He can perform well under pressure.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_363.wav|102|This is not great, but it goes well.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_012.wav|8|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_078.wav|45|He is driven.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_131.wav|65|It's nice to see a very positive style of football.)
DUMMY2/p249/p249_157.wav|80|It is not normal practice.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_331.wav|37|The move follows a review of the Singapore
DUMMY2/p302/p302_278.wav|30|The dictator of Iraq is not disarming.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_333.wav|46|Ferguson did not hesitate.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_270.wav|48|Harrowing is easy, after all.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_210.wav|86|He knows a lot.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_377.wav|22|It is like a theatre of the absurd.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_104.wav|22|I needed a change, a new challenge.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_214.wav|22|Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_113.wav|22|The conversion didn't go over either.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_205.wav|13|I have no conflict with them.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_359.wav|59|But nothing happened.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_375.wav|28|They did not threaten anyone.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_108.wav|17|The picture is the same across Scotland.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_280.wav|42|It may have been a cry for help.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_139.wav|72|But we have to plan for the future.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_263.wav|59|Immediate action must be taken.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_103.wav|81|Meanwhile, the Scottish Consumer Council yesterday offered support for the new Bill.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_249.wav|29|It is possible to be too good.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_381.wav|35|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_011.wav|89|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_374.wav|92|I am a committed European.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_329.wav|16|We are in the end game.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_206.wav|32|I won't make an official complaint.)
DUMMY2/p261/p261_032.wav|100|It was a close call.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_291.wav|26|The results are sometimes contentious.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_088.wav|106|Dumfries and Galloway Council said it was not breaking the Government's directions.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_228.wav|29|He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_019.wav|78|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_314.wav|73|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_007.wav|102|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_023.wav|29|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_101.wav|2|Oil embargo endorsed.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_019.wav|16|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_271.wav|70|She failed in her action.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_107.wav|74|That was my first reaction.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_075.wav|24|There's nothing they can get on me.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_387.wav|94|I am very happy with life.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_134.wav|20|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_075.wav|0|He is in the queue.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_384.wav|54|People might not actually want the job.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_163.wav|46|We offered something different.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_045.wav|68|Our dispute is with the company, not with the travelling public.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_209.wav|29|The sanctions are about collective punishment.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_216.wav|28|You're going to take away my life.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_071.wav|4|It's not just about the shows.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_114.wav|106|It is sometimes like that.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_382.wav|18|Our position is quite clear.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_192.wav|53|I am fighting the force of nature.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_344.wav|27|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_270.wav|0|It is also very valuable.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_003.wav|42|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_301.wav|22|But he was a full, working member of our staff.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_001.wav|64|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_227.wav|59|I might get an injury very easily.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_318.wav|101|The problem was he thought you were a big man.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_289.wav|88|We suspect he was pleased.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_335.wav|73|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_354.wav|72|For next season, we have time to restructure.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_082.wav|100|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_181.wav|95|The research was my life.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_113.wav|73|I'm so angry.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_272.wav|97|We are asking the council to think again.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_356.wav|79|I did not go looking anywhere else.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_186.wav|62|I'm going to see my friend.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_263.wav|70|He was also married with two children.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_200.wav|16|There was an e-mail.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_153.wav|66|My aim is a top six finish.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_253.wav|29|Three weeks later, he resigned.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_092.wav|64|John Prescott is John Prescott, as the prime minister would say.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_113.wav|6|That was certainly the case for the parties.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_338.wav|83|Another case of foot-and-mouth disease was confirmed in Scotland yesterday.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_015.wav|5|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_364.wav|32|Italy was just behind the US.)
DUMMY2/p251/p251_280.wav|9|He thought he had a month to cross the street.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_423.wav|63|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_244.wav|95|It was finally agreed on Saturday.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_351.wav|58|That's the last thing he will do.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_112.wav|26|Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_160.wav|50|Are you going to win ?
DUMMY2/p240/p240_110.wav|93|I came to complete.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_108.wav|36|Why do it otherwise ?
DUMMY2/p374/p374_300.wav|11|Because we do not need it.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_328.wav|63|The dealer is on notice.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_355.wav|12|I didn't even have the first idea.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_230.wav|48|She had gone to the Catholic school.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_120.wav|68|After about a year, the feeling returned to my finger.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_129.wav|91|We now have to concentrate on the league.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_262.wav|13|It should not make the same mistake again.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_348.wav|48|It comes from reflection or thinking.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_035.wav|25|It is a matter of the utmost concern to the Allies.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_223.wav|97|He is at war with his knee.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_121.wav|27|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_341.wav|4|Things don't look too good at the moment.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_300.wav|52|So, did she meet him ?
DUMMY2/p278/p278_198.wav|10|I had come back from London.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_103.wav|31|Before the game we went for a pint.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_249.wav|83|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_117.wav|29|This should begin in October.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_352.wav|73|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_185.wav|57|I took the gun.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_211.wav|38|My friends were very envious.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_256.wav|74|It was quite simply, delicious.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_023.wav|103|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_140.wav|91|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_231.wav|80|It is a gamble.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_218.wav|54|It shows that painting is still relevant.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_412.wav|16|It might be.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_058.wav|73|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_147.wav|96|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_076.wav|43|Help is needed.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_271.wav|8|What are you not good at ?
DUMMY2/p267/p267_249.wav|0|He declined to give any details.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_179.wav|72|The real world is full of competing causes.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_373.wav|86|Talks are progressing.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_343.wav|98|The work was suspended following the kidnap.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_047.wav|89|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_208.wav|63|Motorists will buy passes in advance.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_047.wav|26|It is the whole package.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_343.wav|5|I got a yellow card.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_331.wav|54|They have admitted they cannot meet that outlay.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_073.wav|23|It has been a lovely family occasion.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_028.wav|49|Let's not go overboard.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_351.wav|107|Almost the day after the election, the battle lines were drawn.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_364.wav|76|I'm amazed at what he's done.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_218.wav|17|He was jailed for five years.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_286.wav|37|Each case is treated on merit.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_149.wav|29|That was the difference between the sides.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_209.wav|79|She has always been very friendly.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_216.wav|79|Usually the enjoyment is two ways.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_253.wav|18|We all knew they could do it.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_174.wav|44|I think we showed that after half time.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_373.wav|18|Germany also said it was unimpressed.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_064.wav|52|It also has a good labour supply.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_151.wav|101|Nothing has been put into action.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_392.wav|11|These days are over.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_292.wav|99|I thought it was my only chance.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_138.wav|14|We did what we had to do.)
DUMMY2/p307/p307_240.wav|22|The Tories election campaign has certainly been colourful.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_264.wav|73|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_098.wav|69|Today I couldn't run on it.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_409.wav|40|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_274.wav|97|Hopefully, now we're getting it.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_311.wav|105|Davis is very supportive, as a director.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_092.wav|30|We don't say there wasn't a massacre.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_307.wav|97|That has given me great confidence.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_083.wav|7|William Hague, the guest of honour, was delighted.)
DUMMY2/p260/p260_353.wav|81|Eight months later, he was dead.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_137.wav|29|Our position is quite simple.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_021.wav|43|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_114.wav|30|It is time for a more honest approach.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_359.wav|21|I expected a victory, the pain is enormous.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_448.wav|8|No further details of expansion plans were given.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_116.wav|83|It is so sad.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_226.wav|79|Part-time staff are being laid off.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_261.wav|104|It has certainly not been an enjoyable experience.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_364.wav|38|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_162.wav|50|Why change it ?
DUMMY2/p247/p247_117.wav|14|You had better believe it.)
DUMMY2/p251/p251_159.wav|9|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_178.wav|25|The hotel was now for sale.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_124.wav|80|Who would have?
DUMMY2/p313/p313_330.wav|76|We are now in an election period.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_135.wav|7|Reaction to the device was mixed.)
DUMMY2/p333/p333_335.wav|64|Eleven events are required.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_378.wav|41|He has the edge.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_350.wav|87|I am considered a teenager.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_146.wav|55|That is a big risk at any price.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_406.wav|96|He was a crazy man.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_267.wav|16|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_306.wav|46|And we were right.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_266.wav|9|I've had no discussions with the chairman or the board.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_094.wav|41|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_046.wav|31|Life is good.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_405.wav|13|Clark is back on top form.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_475.wav|50|It was all in a short period of time.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_174.wav|93|I drove the ball well.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_252.wav|25|He said he intended to push for a judicial review.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_112.wav|83|Is that right?
DUMMY2/p261/p261_397.wav|100|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_103.wav|61|It was some time before she found out he was safe.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_237.wav|3|But we are not immune to the problem.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_309.wav|30|If you don't enforce it, you bring it into disrepute.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_412.wav|11|It's always the same, isn't it?
DUMMY2/p248/p248_257.wav|99|They are real.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_194.wav|6|Their own instinctive response was confirmed.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_191.wav|18|Which is worse?
DUMMY2/p250/p250_133.wav|24|This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_018.wav|22|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_379.wav|102|They should have some measure of protection.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_143.wav|16|It is not just about pay.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_165.wav|14|IT S all change at Kilmarnock.)
DUMMY2/p234/p234_241.wav|3|A deadline is still essential.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_060.wav|21|The decision is purely down to the clinic.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_052.wav|107|He served in the Gulf, the Falklands, and Northern Ireland.

DUMMY2/p234/p234_047.wav|3|It depends on the decisions of the member states.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_122.wav|36|Lady Thatcher was the only woman with full membership.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_261.wav|88|It does not take much.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_124.wav|74|She was not hard done by.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_471.wav|39|That should get their attention.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_362.wav|65|Her body has never been found.)
DUMMY2/p236/p236_471.wav|75|He was certainly upbeat about his chances.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_278.wav|72|It is my fault.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_299.wav|46|They played it like a cup final.

DUMMY2/p245/p245_015.wav|59|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_161.wav|73|Mr Blunkett said he was deeply concerned by the ruling.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_027.wav|78|We want to lift the cup for the fans.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_335.wav|98|Not because they want to sing about something.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_060.wav|6|What's the problem?
DUMMY2/p318/p318_332.wav|19|Three people were pronounced dead at the scene.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_307.wav|104|Cinema is a communal experience.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_022.wav|9|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_014.wav|29|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
