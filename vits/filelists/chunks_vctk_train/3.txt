DUMMY2/p343/p343_160.wav|21|It had been played at festivals.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_318.wav|42|I am not against a further inquiry.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_087.wav|94|Someone who cares
DUMMY2/p364/p364_030.wav|88|Prime minister Blair is not that way.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_085.wav|56|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_267.wav|104|I would love to travel with it.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_031.wav|89|This is the window.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_280.wav|27|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_084.wav|88|I was close enough.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_314.wav|55|If a service doesn't pay it will go.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_193.wav|93|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_327.wav|26|I came into this world with nothing.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_378.wav|17|The methadone programme is completely out of control.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_220.wav|57|I had decided to quit the show.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_213.wav|99|Twaddle is a case in point.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_271.wav|25|It is the same in Sweden.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_085.wav|53|No plan for projects are yet in place.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_239.wav|47|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_299.wav|5|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_347.wav|64|For now, we must take one game at a time.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_129.wav|87|It wasn't possible to relax.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_168.wav|75|Overall, the labour market continued to tighten.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_384.wav|29|He is in the queue.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_228.wav|94|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_062.wav|20|Try to save us.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_063.wav|70|It happened so quickly.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_415.wav|74|There are two interests in this woodland.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_097.wav|79|You didn't get a modified.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_132.wav|9|Government will intervene.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_062.wav|72|They don't know how to do it.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_322.wav|29|The judge was really nice.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_200.wav|84|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_119.wav|55|Its failure is no surprise.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_292.wav|38|You've been a great audience.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_114.wav|22|He took away my childhood.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_075.wav|33|It was a pretty terrible day.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_357.wav|65|Neil knows the score.)
DUMMY2/p247/p247_118.wav|14|The website has changed the company.)
DUMMY2/p292/p292_099.wav|13|Life becomes a song.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_018.wav|81|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_060.wav|14|Do I have a favourite ?)
DUMMY2/p271/p271_001.wav|27|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_427.wav|8|The need for any new UN resolutions will be put on hold.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_306.wav|85|It is an expensive part of their equipment.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_166.wav|90|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_310.wav|15|That is my commitment.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_332.wav|84|However, Sharon rejected the claims.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_009.wav|42|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_128.wav|94|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_012.wav|5|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_369.wav|43|He took over our lives.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_259.wav|94|The distinction is also supported by doctors.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_385.wav|82|This is the last chance, and everyone knows it.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_014.wav|66|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_032.wav|3|Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_359.wav|20|We will be homeless.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_360.wav|23|All these things have an impact.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_041.wav|26|The judge said.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_036.wav|4|Green is desperate to play in The Open.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_241.wav|20|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_162.wav|10|So was the first half.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_101.wav|60|It is not in the public interest.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_371.wav|98|It looked like a war zone.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_241.wav|88|That is our business.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_226.wav|80|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_359.wav|53|Under Alex Ferguson, Aberdeen showed it could be done.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_214.wav|59|At the time, he was a living legend.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_017.wav|63|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_011.wav|11|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_277.wav|99|He looked very sharp.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_407.wav|33|But the Foreign Secretary can cope.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_103.wav|92|Have you heard anything from Paramount?
DUMMY2/p301/p301_236.wav|91|I came up through the ranks.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_332.wav|48|January is a bad time of year.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_009.wav|70|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_298.wav|12|My view has now completely changed.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_181.wav|86|It is minute.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_396.wav|49|I'll tell you honestly.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_323.wav|104|I wanted to drop out.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_226.wav|90|It is a gamble.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_336.wav|63|And he goes with it.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_244.wav|48|What was the matter for concern ?
DUMMY2/p316/p316_378.wav|85|Ali was shot at, but refused to back down.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_218.wav|9|A Grampian Police spokesman said.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_271.wav|46|It was a journey into a new life.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_406.wav|0|I thought he was an animal.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_051.wav|86|He looks like an Afghan.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_298.wav|54|This is a huge confidence boost.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_172.wav|19|That is not a position they enjoy.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_275.wav|96|Lottery money was intended to be used for good causes.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_296.wav|89|They are wrong.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_301.wav|73|Horses are drawn by ballot.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_032.wav|93|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_374.wav|95|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_208.wav|106|My father died in childbirth.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_066.wav|10|The talks were announced yesterday by Brian Wilson, the foreign office minister.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_311.wav|27|There is no excuse.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_179.wav|85|Everything in the world was focused on London.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_274.wav|56|It was an easy decision to come here.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_304.wav|8|It would be great to win the title again.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_366.wav|96|It benefits the whole family.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_282.wav|93|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_171.wav|8|That would open the gates of hell.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_370.wav|24|We're still the only ones in the High Street.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_004.wav|81|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_143.wav|5|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_335.wav|33|Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_363.wav|36|They should take their mobile phones.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_367.wav|21|In the end, however, it all came together.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_087.wav|16|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_242.wav|70|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_293.wav|16|And it's a goodbye from him.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_001.wav|78|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_015.wav|38|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_399.wav|70|It might be.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_465.wav|75|I was all image and no substance.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_149.wav|51|He was telling me to keep quiet.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_108.wav|0|That admission is not surprising.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_191.wav|96|I wish I could say something.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_153.wav|32|And sooner than we may think.)
DUMMY2/p312/p312_293.wav|62|It would also take time.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_047.wav|28|What on earth is wrong with you?
DUMMY2/p336/p336_008.wav|98|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_043.wav|19|We are not moving in.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_340.wav|26|They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_318.wav|78|We have to be very, very careful.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_068.wav|38|It was a move which appealed to him.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_258.wav|67|Kirkwood was arrested.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_124.wav|81|I can't even get into the A team.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_161.wav|7|We have to speed up the process.)
DUMMY2/p256/p256_309.wav|90|O Neill is caught between a rock and a hard place.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_257.wav|21|Horses are not affected.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_064.wav|12|Robin Williams is very subdued.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_351.wav|19|That might help a bit.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_319.wav|18|It will not be easy for him.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_229.wav|25|At the time, he was a living legend.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_193.wav|4|I have done ever since it was published.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_060.wav|95|So is that it, then ?
DUMMY2/p251/p251_027.wav|9|That's no bad thing.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_283.wav|86|I should think so, too.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_143.wav|32|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis.)
DUMMY2/p298/p298_084.wav|68|Audacious decisions were taken early on.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_406.wav|60|Still, it is a very good result for us.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_165.wav|93|Tell it like it was?
DUMMY2/p272/p272_057.wav|69|He looks like an Afghan.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_186.wav|50|They need to look after themselves.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_386.wav|107|Liberal Democrat leader makes a hash of it.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_379.wav|29|I would like to focus on a structure and a target.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_213.wav|51|I am a little bit tired.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_057.wav|95|There was no safety net.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_370.wav|51|This means a great deal to the families.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_190.wav|20|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_110.wav|80|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_286.wav|42|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_193.wav|28|This is still a young team, you know.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_115.wav|104|Who will deliver more service to Scotland?
DUMMY2/p236/p236_372.wav|75|We used to keep our business rates.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_101.wav|18|Six men will take the decision.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_119.wav|59|Who will attend?
DUMMY2/p267/p267_098.wav|0|Sport is good for you.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_143.wav|6|Maybe it will work there.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_215.wav|17|Hopefully, the whole of Scottish rugby was paying attention.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_441.wav|63|Everything in golf is a balance.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_080.wav|26|We have other options.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_408.wav|75|The trick is to try it.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_336.wav|29|What are they for ?
DUMMY2/p281/p281_023.wav|36|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_294.wav|57|They are wrong.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_410.wav|33|Everyone has his share of trouble.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_187.wav|74|This was an option from the beginning.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_085.wav|42|You could feel the heat.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_379.wav|34|I'll have to work on that.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_373.wav|8|I came here this week to work.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_059.wav|40|This is the first step.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_269.wav|102|THE best marriages are made in heaven.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_335.wav|22|There was no let-up for the minnows.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_034.wav|95|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_015.wav|68|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_201.wav|105|But I am a worried man.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_043.wav|106|I might well have done so already.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_049.wav|69|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_229.wav|30|It is something that we will put right.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_082.wav|33|He was rejected because he had retired.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_009.wav|76|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_148.wav|30|The Real IRA was blamed for the blast.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_328.wav|26|It is a strong case.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_122.wav|51|But the killer remains at large.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_435.wav|7|I watch the other visitors.)
DUMMY2/p247/p247_134.wav|14|But it could be a consequence of our policy.)
DUMMY2/p257/p257_312.wav|105|We are in the end game.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_004.wav|75|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_039.wav|80|She is believed to be in South Africa.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_037.wav|60|We are just happy that hasn't happened.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_118.wav|54|We've come from a long way back.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_461.wav|24|The budget was too low for that.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_349.wav|18|We're very close to being a good team.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_267.wav|91|I do not own the vessel in question.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_330.wav|87|Drink and petrol prices remain untouched.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_019.wav|25|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_083.wav|34|These things just happen.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_216.wav|72|The position on the euro remains unchanged.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_103.wav|11|I hope they understand that.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_166.wav|4|Two options are being proposed.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_219.wav|22|What are you not good at?
DUMMY2/p226/p226_267.wav|43|George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_021.wav|36|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_135.wav|93|Government will intervene.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_167.wav|25|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_353.wav|50|The units will not be replaced.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_081.wav|13|I can't believe she is dead.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_314.wav|44|What if the confession is, after all, a fake?
DUMMY2/p343/p343_054.wav|21|I must take a seat.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_353.wav|55|The senior management team will be drawn from both companies.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_204.wav|20|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_078.wav|54|This has not, and has been neglected.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_282.wav|6|Other people had looked at it.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_154.wav|83|They have not been named.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_264.wav|86|Immediate action must be taken.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_281.wav|1|I felt really good until Friday.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_229.wav|102|You can feel at home in China.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_168.wav|9|The post will be unpaid.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_110.wav|97|It is a potential factor.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_105.wav|22|Is your life a little too easy?
DUMMY2/p244/p244_320.wav|78|Hopefully, this week will be good.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_260.wav|75|It is very hard for her.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_377.wav|13|It is a hard act to follow, the Winning act.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_210.wav|68|He had taken everything from me.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_289.wav|101|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_262.wav|80|Blood samples were taken.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_060.wav|71|"The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine."
DUMMY2/p274/p274_168.wav|32|It's not good at all.)
DUMMY2/p258/p258_172.wav|26|If that's the case, he will struggle.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_097.wav|104|In fact, they go hand in hand.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_400.wav|79|She had denied the charge.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_160.wav|53|A progress report will be published in October.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_059.wav|81|We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_080.wav|40|He is driven.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_425.wav|89|It all began as an accident.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_315.wav|103|There is no threat to them.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_353.wav|24|Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_179.wav|78|I think the Labour party is completely split on this.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_445.wav|32|Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.)
DUMMY2/p266/p266_149.wav|20|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_186.wav|10|They are determined to make a meaningful contribution.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_062.wav|21|But that's another story for another day.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_104.wav|93|That all hope is never lost.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_138.wav|6|I will be having talks with the workforce.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_188.wav|21|It was good today.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_118.wav|95|There were no grounds for his action.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_172.wav|61|We knew we had the goal we wanted.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_385.wav|14|to have products for their needs.)
DUMMY2/p284/p284_173.wav|16|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_440.wav|100|It will make a huge difference.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_384.wav|102|But this is not just a Tibetan issue.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_029.wav|9|However, the following year the cancer returned.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_091.wav|69|Someone who cares
DUMMY2/p363/p363_363.wav|6|It was great fun.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_241.wav|62|Partly, it is his own fault.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_420.wav|89|There's been a mistake.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_261.wav|89|The system can work.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_197.wav|76|They should feel ashamed.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_266.wav|38|Some old favourites remain in varying forms.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_263.wav|6|He was travelling to see his daughter.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_183.wav|29|I have spoken to head office.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_380.wav|26|Colour was at the core of his life.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_383.wav|6|It was a double tragedy for the family.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_189.wav|79|Now he is back on top again.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_194.wav|0|I came home by ambulance.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_399.wav|42|The work with Alison was a great experience.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_222.wav|56|The output price index in December was unchanged on November.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_341.wav|103|That is no use.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_248.wav|93|Jock Brown is appointed as general manager.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_100.wav|8|The following are the principal provisions.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_089.wav|100|The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_109.wav|28|A management agreement, however, was conceded.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_015.wav|90|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_094.wav|21|It is par for the course, of course.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_198.wav|44|The Government faces a moral dilemma.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_334.wav|43|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_288.wav|8|It was never a free kick.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_110.wav|76|I took the gun.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_137.wav|23|Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_183.wav|10|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_406.wav|66|They hold on for many years.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_149.wav|106|What happened in that game ?
DUMMY2/p241/p241_162.wav|86|We have to move forward.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_179.wav|25|I drove the ball well.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_027.wav|96|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_020.wav|105|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_123.wav|103|They are so easy for youngsters to open.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_243.wav|80|The problem in Norway is outside the National.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_276.wav|63|And they were being paid ?
DUMMY2/p303/p303_128.wav|44|A lot of people were in tears.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_394.wav|14|Theatre is not a museum.)
DUMMY2/p334/p334_340.wav|38|What did we learn?
DUMMY2/p305/p305_314.wav|54|She told me to apply for the crest.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_184.wav|62|There was a substantial explosion.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_041.wav|25|She is believed to be in South Africa.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_301.wav|18|It turned out to have been three hours.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_118.wav|74|In fact, they have the opposite effect.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_126.wav|41|I joined a group.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_015.wav|64|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_042.wav|21|That was the theory, anyway.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_462.wav|32|Driving has been the key.)
DUMMY2/p279/p279_168.wav|25|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_010.wav|50|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_058.wav|90|It is unique.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_412.wav|69|I reminded myself that we were not talking about a death.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_148.wav|86|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_192.wav|106|Sacking John Redwood is a disaster.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_190.wav|66|We are on the path of change.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_280.wav|90|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_287.wav|75|Blair also had a penalty.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_195.wav|1|The luxury has been well used.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_153.wav|106|And they all have a vote.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_279.wav|9|Rehearsals will start in the new year for the extended season.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_312.wav|45|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_174.wav|105|We wanted it left for a wee while.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_221.wav|39|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_218.wav|4|Would it be good for the Nationwide League?
DUMMY2/p259/p259_130.wav|7|It is a variable condition and the diagnosis is difficult.)
DUMMY2/p360/p360_385.wav|60|I didn't do it.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_224.wav|23|I've had six days of rehearsal.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_236.wav|24|It's just a normal life.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_093.wav|59|It was some time before she found out he was safe.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_132.wav|29|I felt he was excellent.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_396.wav|100|However, it was well worth the wait.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_196.wav|98|In fact, it was almost as if it was expected.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_022.wav|104|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_300.wav|42|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_041.wav|73|A neighbour said.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_032.wav|26|He took me on a tour of the wards.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_386.wav|67|Three years ago he would have been.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_178.wav|12|It's a commission, and for it's work, a year's work.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_195.wav|97|Women were mostly notable by their absence.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_350.wav|5|The pair are very much in love.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_028.wav|77|On our numbers, the price is in line with the asset value.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_155.wav|1|His parenthood is called into question.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_097.wav|97|Our approach will be different.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_235.wav|61|I can't wait to meet him.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_202.wav|21|This is an internal matter.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_339.wav|22|He wasn't really doing anything, so he wanted out.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_141.wav|102|That's because we work hard at it.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_260.wav|106|They've got some extremely good players.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_227.wav|17|Dancing will help his ankles and his feet.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_411.wav|105|Now, however, it has undergone a dramatic decline.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_390.wav|87|And it had two seats.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_275.wav|40|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_251.wav|27|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_352.wav|8|Whether this return was too soon.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_154.wav|31|We shall not be moved.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_018.wav|1|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_236.wav|21|Men should avoid it like the plague.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_418.wav|11|And well he might.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_446.wav|7|If he saw somebody in trouble, he would try to help.)
DUMMY2/p292/p292_069.wav|13|Lose, and they would be ridiculed.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_410.wav|55|All the dead were believed to have been French.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_100.wav|35|But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_028.wav|90|Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_420.wav|54|Jack McConnell is the obvious choice.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_190.wav|39|I feel like my game has come a long way.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_260.wav|36|Clearly, the need for a personal loan is written in the stars.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_051.wav|12|On the contrary, some of the music is very expensive.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_308.wav|60|We are not physical at all.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_072.wav|10|It's all going to clear the debt.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_031.wav|74|He was very close.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_165.wav|6|I always savour the company of The Voice.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_067.wav|89|I feel I did not have enough time.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_140.wav|44|I played really well on the back nine.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_338.wav|82|He was overwhelmed by the response.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_225.wav|68|It did my image a lot of good!
DUMMY2/p341/p341_216.wav|66|It didn't get any better.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_164.wav|7|Nothing was meant by it.)
DUMMY2/p329/p329_295.wav|103|Our young people are leaving.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_088.wav|6|It has come a long way since then.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_322.wav|19|But will they fall in love?
DUMMY2/p301/p301_402.wav|91|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_341.wav|22|I am not putting myself down.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_298.wav|72|We come here in peace, for peace.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_076.wav|5|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_238.wav|105|They may yet have the last laugh.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_061.wav|63|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_414.wav|33|This is a successful outcome.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_109.wav|98|I want to keep playing.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_044.wav|16|The shift in public perception about the disease is amazing.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_280.wav|0|It would create a Scottish secretary with a lot of weight.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_407.wav|87|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_010.wav|30|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_342.wav|104|She is an imposing presence.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_088.wav|36|The cut is excellent news for the consumer.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_340.wav|42|This is the start of a slippery slope.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_272.wav|105|He looked very sharp.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_066.wav|105|I was just trying to win the golf tournament.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_184.wav|53|We have come a long way since then.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_097.wav|16|I am extremely sad.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_422.wav|19|Now, that is a good deal.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_202.wav|96|The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_142.wav|28|I'm the one that said it.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_197.wav|75|That is a waste of energy.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_271.wav|34|It is not great art.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_268.wav|80|It is the same in Sweden.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_223.wav|23|We never got off the bus.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_094.wav|2|Journalists should make him.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_074.wav|37|We felt it was sufficient.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_340.wav|86|They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_060.wav|64|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_340.wav|56|He was at school in Devon.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_118.wav|29|My life has changed a lot.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_413.wav|38|The hangover was Olympian.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_385.wav|39|Scottish teams have got to take their chances.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_164.wav|48|Scotland will be an integral part of Abbey National.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_416.wav|54|But it is all by design.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_086.wav|15|Three bystanders were killed.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_418.wav|1|Now, however, it has undergone a dramatic decline.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_362.wav|76|It was the same at Twickenham.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_424.wav|27|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_299.wav|26|Graeme was prepared.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_185.wav|99|We did everything by the book.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_294.wav|90|Who can predict?
DUMMY2/p364/p364_106.wav|88|Long-term, it was the right thing to do.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_096.wav|96|Then came the crunch.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_437.wav|89|That brought a wonderful marriage of bass and soprano.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_187.wav|65|I remember that day well.)
DUMMY2/p326/p326_048.wav|28|We will continue to pressure the Government.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_444.wav|37|I believe we can handle this okay.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_112.wav|78|But he has not become a monster.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_243.wav|32|I was released after six days.)
DUMMY2/p247/p247_010.wav|14|People look, but no one ever finds it. )
DUMMY2/p292/p292_108.wav|13|Seven people were later detained by police.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_094.wav|97|He was critically ill in hospital last night.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_234.wav|8|People should make their own decisions.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_087.wav|0|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_073.wav|104|Two things were clear from the new programme.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_112.wav|91|And that is our first victory in Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_426.wav|37|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_163.wav|29|Nobody did in those days.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_373.wav|42|It's like English in its underwear.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_107.wav|60|That would be even more disastrous.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_087.wav|7|So is that it, then ?)
DUMMY2/p269/p269_086.wav|94|All options are open.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_302.wav|46|I think it is a great shame.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_392.wav|62|It's the whole season.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_211.wav|46|My attitude is exactly the same as before.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_130.wav|78|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_295.wav|29|It was never a free kick.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_348.wav|104|The result could be all down to turnout.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_040.wav|3|We are the party of the future.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_088.wav|29|We will deal with the refugees.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_353.wav|60|This is a moment to seize.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_229.wav|59|He was good, but not that good.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_370.wav|102|I think, at last, the company will find itself again.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_143.wav|55|Domestic orders have also fallen since January.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_031.wav|40|There's a story, too.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_092.wav|48|Does it matter ?
DUMMY2/p323/p323_346.wav|34|If they have City backing, what is the influence?
DUMMY2/p362/p362_177.wav|15|He is a master of deceit and delay.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_412.wav|105|I recommend a tour.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_302.wav|14|I wanted to change the formula.)
DUMMY2/p268/p268_158.wav|87|Before the game we went for a pint.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_074.wav|58|The settlement could run to millions.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_209.wav|83|It had all been arranged.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_136.wav|81|It seems so long since I did the exams.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_208.wav|55|The role was perfect for Russell.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_013.wav|73|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_332.wav|101|It's difficult to predict the future.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_224.wav|39|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_116.wav|100|Actors like to be in the centre.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_269.wav|1|Mary is, as it were, the cause of her mother's death.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_150.wav|0|Not a great deal has changed in the last decade.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_174.wav|35|Phase one was a shambles.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_184.wav|51|There is no way to do this.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_042.wav|74|This is great news.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_335.wav|82|Stock markets will be watching closely.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_238.wav|97|He did not report it.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_006.wav|14|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. )
DUMMY2/p351/p351_152.wav|33|There is nothing they can't do.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_244.wav|76|This was done by the council staff.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_386.wav|79|It could have been prevented.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_044.wav|85|The question is, Will it be enough?
DUMMY2/p233/p233_364.wav|84|They received a reply from their own managers.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_079.wav|71|"Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night."
DUMMY2/p238/p238_085.wav|37|It is somewhere to be.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_192.wav|72|There is a contract in existence for Allan.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_143.wav|74|It looks like a hit.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_301.wav|80|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_370.wav|2|There is no signature.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_355.wav|96|On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_153.wav|85|We were not consulted regarding this appointment.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_131.wav|47|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_001.wav|15|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_219.wav|37|Bottling is now the core business.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_144.wav|99|He is severe.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_089.wav|1|However, you have just got to adjust to it.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_039.wav|4|He tried to stop it, but it was already too late.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_412.wav|13|They would not tell us.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_327.wav|80|He was then replaced by Ross.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_012.wav|72|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_371.wav|82|I couldn't put my finger on it.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_056.wav|16|I expect a rapid response.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_134.wav|72|The Lobby is not failing.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_309.wav|44|No-one, not even the Scottish Arts Council, was interested in her.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_024.wav|95|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_318.wav|96|The home team had an amazing start.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_084.wav|85|Weaknesses there are, however.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_381.wav|76|It is, however, an unlikely outcome.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_100.wav|16|May not have been at fault?
DUMMY2/p257/p257_305.wav|105|Henman has been warned.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_239.wav|79|The years of campaigning have been very difficult.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_094.wav|24|The commission initiated the necessary changes in the financial regulation.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_107.wav|78|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_273.wav|38|Where was their passion, the power and feeling?
DUMMY2/p255/p255_263.wav|31|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_398.wav|65|It was an attitude thing.)
DUMMY2/p239/p239_264.wav|48|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_368.wav|98|He was taken to hospital, but later died.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_465.wav|65|He enjoyed being with his family.)
DUMMY2/p334/p334_345.wav|38|She wondered why we were interested.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_141.wav|48|A move to Manchester United would be tremendous.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_068.wav|46|We were given a break.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_070.wav|15|Allison is not convinced.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_248.wav|10|A fatal accident inquiry will be held into the death.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_343.wav|106|And we have the experience.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_254.wav|30|We are at a crossroads.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_267.wav|73|The record companies have gone through the floor.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_090.wav|79|I was saying, No.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_009.wav|19|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_423.wav|15|Or, rather, it isn't.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_165.wav|51|I should not be able to stand.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_170.wav|102|What has caused the demise of singing?
DUMMY2/p261/p261_045.wav|100|He will need that machine.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_321.wav|16|We have got to get the points from this one.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_261.wav|17|He also presented You Bet!
DUMMY2/p295/p295_259.wav|92|That's the most important thing for me.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_407.wav|26|We have not yet received a letter from the Irish.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_252.wav|23|That's why he plays for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_386.wav|8|She is obviously very disappointed.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_023.wav|98|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed forms yellow.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_393.wav|7|How do you take them away ?)
DUMMY2/p297/p297_086.wav|42|She is still very poorly.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_147.wav|55|I am never fully fit.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_292.wav|55|His season started this afternoon.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_366.wav|18|There are moments of honesty, too.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_396.wav|51|We can make changes.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_250.wav|13|I have played well the past two days.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_071.wav|25|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_241.wav|71|"We will need to study the report before any decision is taken."
DUMMY2/p241/p241_157.wav|86|It was so new, so exciting.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_093.wav|80|And rugby fans can help.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_071.wav|93|It came as a surprise because my job is to go backwards.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_235.wav|46|He wouldn't allow that to happen.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_238.wav|33|He is doing the right things.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_145.wav|13|I have a great respect for her.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_271.wav|26|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_165.wav|18|How can they say that?
DUMMY2/p244/p244_151.wav|78|I can't even get into the A team.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_219.wav|54|Then there's one where people play for fun.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_248.wav|26|I was shocked.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_244.wav|84|Chambers said he would accept the place.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_041.wav|98|Whatever we are doing, they have good reason to come.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_074.wav|34|He's a joy to follow.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_302.wav|65|It changed the very language.)
DUMMY2/p233/p233_169.wav|84|It is so unfair.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_216.wav|82|And we will do it.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_248.wav|89|Is that a serious question?
DUMMY2/p283/p283_332.wav|95|We would hope to make progress on that next year.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_092.wav|81|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_365.wav|58|I don't have a new house.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_044.wav|78|If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_117.wav|45|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_046.wav|73|There was no safety net.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_288.wav|93|His mother refuses to believe that she is dead.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_076.wav|50|That would be too easy.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_041.wav|51|Pupils and staff were sent home early.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_145.wav|39|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_426.wav|27|It was like someone had died.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_007.wav|89|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_269.wav|49|Nothing can bring back their son.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_250.wav|23|Advice and counselling will be offered.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_173.wav|27|We have a budget in March.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_111.wav|17|There are lots of these women in Finland.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_334.wav|16|Relief was beyond belief.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_236.wav|27|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_126.wav|106|Many others are subjected to violence by men.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_116.wav|82|Everyone is deeply shocked by this appaling accident.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_226.wav|3|The deal is expected to be completed by September.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_203.wav|104|We now have a moment of hope.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_049.wav|48|We must learn to finish.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_041.wav|57|On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_303.wav|63|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_308.wav|99|Craig is a major concern for us.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_076.wav|15|The real problem is the Usher Hall.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_217.wav|64|I've invented a village in East Lothian.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_313.wav|98|But this isn't a play about The Troubles.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_192.wav|9|We have to recognise that he is an elusive character.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_087.wav|1|It was an easy decision to come here.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_298.wav|55|They have played their part.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_315.wav|30|It's like the Russians.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_355.wav|72|The truth, of course, is very different.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_192.wav|50|People will ask about us.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_098.wav|14|He had missed a penalty against the English.)
DUMMY2/p336/p336_205.wav|98|It's part of the end game.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_210.wav|13|We are being realistic about the challenges ahead.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_356.wav|23|Patients will be partners in decision making.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_416.wav|103|Yet it is all for two good causes.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_049.wav|84|Part of the complex is historic.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_063.wav|12|Meanwhile, the weather was causing widespread disruption.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_002.wav|98|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_236.wav|22|I came up through the ranks.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_009.wav|14|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. )
DUMMY2/p272/p272_295.wav|69|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_189.wav|98|It is a good result for Great Britain.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_053.wav|16|My fitness was very poor.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_061.wav|38|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_223.wav|20|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_048.wav|65|There remains some Scottish influence, however.)
DUMMY2/p302/p302_179.wav|30|I will have to order its destruction.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_060.wav|13|There are two interests in this woodland.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_269.wav|84|They are never here.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_371.wav|91|There is no magical figure, but there are criteria.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_285.wav|3|Do you think we're a top nation ?
DUMMY2/p274/p274_470.wav|32|You have to have a proven track record to get them.)
DUMMY2/p314/p314_196.wav|51|We will reform the welfare state.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_291.wav|2|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_259.wav|31|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_255.wav|97|He will do so today in Monte Carlo.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_277.wav|16|We are a grandmother.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_328.wav|23|What is the Working Families Tax Credit?
DUMMY2/p283/p283_419.wav|95|How do you take them away ?
DUMMY2/p335/p335_036.wav|49|Pupils and staff were sent home early.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_277.wav|84|And Michael was just great.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_431.wav|24|His ambition was made this year when he played alongside his son.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_206.wav|51|He or she will oversee the leadership contest.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_179.wav|36|The Hibs manager is no fool.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_412.wav|85|I have signed a contract.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_096.wav|34|There is no conflict of interest.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_017.wav|55|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_015.wav|15|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_421.wav|13|He was back to square one.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_100.wav|54|They never looked like winning it either.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_013.wav|46|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_304.wav|92|I love this tournament.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_269.wav|38|I would recommend it.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_114.wav|47|This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_287.wav|32|It has raised the profile of Scottish banking.)
DUMMY2/p253/p253_096.wav|70|He's been hit by it.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_262.wav|67|They must play for each other.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_044.wav|19|We have not had a formal request.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_056.wav|30|Henry was strong and talented.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_143.wav|38|Our offer will remain on the table.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_363.wav|107|It's not easy to live in Russia.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_203.wav|81|It had all been arranged.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_206.wav|5|I have decided to quit the show.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_267.wav|9|We run within the law.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_441.wav|75|The damage is all inside.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_312.wav|82|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_117.wav|83|Tony Blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from Dublin.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_281.wav|8|This could put pressure on UK inflation.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_182.wav|93|They need to look after themselves.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_318.wav|66|Farmers have been an endangered species.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_301.wav|74|There is a lot of fear.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_156.wav|16|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_260.wav|52|And they never show the same film as a rival.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_195.wav|76|They believed it worked.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_199.wav|5|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_115.wav|42|That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_003.wav|56|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_101.wav|65|Two of our crew were killed.)
DUMMY2/p247/p247_189.wav|14|They bought the property four years ago.)
DUMMY2/p237/p237_073.wav|61|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_042.wav|14|They said she was stable.)
DUMMY2/p307/p307_016.wav|22|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_119.wav|46|Why did it take a concerted campaign?
DUMMY2/p351/p351_020.wav|33|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_303.wav|82|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_417.wav|105|War is not the action.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_288.wav|105|I thought it was my only chance.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_253.wav|106|For business, the benefits will be enormous.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_308.wav|37|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_313.wav|59|Craig is a major concern for us.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_343.wav|55|We are a husband and wife team.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_030.wav|46|Gaelic provision continued to be good.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_148.wav|20|It is not just about pay.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_279.wav|23|That, however, is only part of their story.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_363.wav|16|The pair are very much in love.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_116.wav|102|He was the deputy editor at the paper.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_015.wav|94|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_006.wav|61|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_051.wav|55|She continued to enjoy sport.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_229.wav|31|A career as a doctor is on hold.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_326.wav|9|In fact, they have the opposite effect.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_157.wav|59|I drove the ball well.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_012.wav|65|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. )
DUMMY2/p360/p360_412.wav|60|I thought they played well.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_060.wav|76|It is not a standing army.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_073.wav|27|He was at home with his pals.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_412.wav|24|Neither man has been charged.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_260.wav|18|It was an amazing experience.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_085.wav|92|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_137.wav|96|The goals were good.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_107.wav|4|Is there anything in the wound?
DUMMY2/p340/p340_264.wav|74|We've had a lot of adjusting to do.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_066.wav|64|It sounded awfully like panic.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_109.wav|40|It's a shame.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_264.wav|6|It's an hour of the same response.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_157.wav|32|They should stop the bombing.)
DUMMY2/p239/p239_372.wav|48|That took about two years.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_397.wav|69|It will take place in July.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_224.wav|49|We have great sympathy with Danny.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_324.wav|65|They really had a go at us.)
DUMMY2/p360/p360_025.wav|60|You can never take a win for granted.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_076.wav|47|I've not thought about it.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_291.wav|14|It opens the door to the Champions League.)
DUMMY2/p259/p259_048.wav|7|They had to explain it.)
DUMMY2/p266/p266_072.wav|20|It is a job creation scheme.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_293.wav|13|They are the heroes.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_206.wav|46|He was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_065.wav|58|He takes time out for everyone.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_055.wav|73|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_292.wav|18|Yesterday was a statement of intent.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_333.wav|31|It can be halted.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_378.wav|97|We talk to each other about these matters.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_303.wav|97|It is like a bereavement.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_065.wav|37|We hadn't really taken that seriously before.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_209.wav|15|I have no secrets.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_112.wav|65|This makes up for it.)
DUMMY2/p258/p258_176.wav|26|Almost the day after the election, the battle lines were drawn.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_195.wav|31|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_100.wav|21|Frankly, the party was not being honest with itself.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_038.wav|57|President Bush is at war.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_101.wav|9|It is a good lifestyle.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_136.wav|23|That is why we are here.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_166.wav|15|So, easy does it.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_265.wav|107|We always thought it should be digital, and cheap.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_040.wav|92|Our children are the future of our society.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_126.wav|49|Pig farmers are completely despondent.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_309.wav|67|It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_014.wav|60|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_286.wav|13|In Europe, it is always over two games.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_299.wav|91|That is the first job of the director - leadership.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_125.wav|103|More patience and composure was required.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_071.wav|75|It looks like a hit.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_318.wav|27|The election is total confusion and chaos.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_035.wav|17|Scotland has lost a great religious leader.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_327.wav|42|You will never replace the child.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_322.wav|107|They are there to get people into work.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_212.wav|66|I asked why he had come.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_410.wav|72|They are not a set of options.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_068.wav|39|Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_176.wav|90|The hotel was now for sale.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_198.wav|61|If the director is with you.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_093.wav|81|Then came the crunch.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_163.wav|79|That comes at a cost.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_246.wav|86|They are different types.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_037.wav|10|It was a hell of a way to lose.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_145.wav|86|I am just trying to do my job.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_089.wav|30|It's a flourishing and beautiful city.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_241.wav|12|The property is owned by Glasgow City Council.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_280.wav|1|Who would take it now, after all this?
DUMMY2/p252/p252_336.wav|55|Do you think we are a top nation ?
DUMMY2/p267/p267_085.wav|0|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_298.wav|86|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_189.wav|13|It is a very sad day.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_138.wav|72|How many cases have there been?
DUMMY2/p250/p250_202.wav|24|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_321.wav|24|Again the parallel with football can be drawn.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_168.wav|1|So too Eriksson, as yet unbeaten on his travels with England.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_366.wav|23|This is our chance in Northern Ireland.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_147.wav|57|Who would be right ?
DUMMY2/p283/p283_412.wav|95|But the foundations have been laid.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_047.wav|18|The jury is still out on this one.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_027.wav|37|We must convince the citizens.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_366.wav|41|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_293.wav|68|I felt under no pressure today.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_179.wav|26|Four policemen were wounded.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_321.wav|4|This was another video cassette.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_244.wav|85|Planting is unlikely to start before next spring.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_020.wav|59|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_363.wav|25|By that time, however, it was already too late.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_148.wav|67|Three penalties were given.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_227.wav|62|It made me determined to get back.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_196.wav|42|I was just doing my job.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_207.wav|7|He should emerge as the winner.)
DUMMY2/p318/p318_156.wav|19|If so, we want to hear from them.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_276.wav|99|If not, he should go home.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_108.wav|63|We could not get any possession.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_092.wav|72|It was one he was born to play.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_408.wav|49|There is no going back.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_167.wav|86|The post will be unpaid.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_220.wav|60|I was pleased about that.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_361.wav|41|Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_208.wav|102|We were on top and could've won.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_227.wav|98|We have big ideas.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_044.wav|100|I would love to have him home.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_020.wav|13|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_170.wav|69|Again, we were lucky.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_337.wav|96|His legal adviser was also not in court yesterday.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_342.wav|16|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_247.wav|53|Church leaders warned other homes could close.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_327.wav|16|For the moment, our position remains the same.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_237.wav|67|The track is currently covered in snow.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_407.wav|63|It's too close to call.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_203.wav|91|If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_342.wav|34|Everyone thought they were safe.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_312.wav|40|We have got no money to go anywhere.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_332.wav|104|The need for further investment is obvious.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_023.wav|60|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_358.wav|52|His style was direct and very human.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_343.wav|20|I'm very lucky.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_228.wav|107|But, by that time, of course, it is again.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_359.wav|103|Pray that it is so.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_270.wav|73|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_287.wav|1|He later became a respected High Court judge.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_043.wav|100|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_232.wav|86|Hospitals are for the ill.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_058.wav|106|And they removed a Borderer.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_436.wav|14|There is another important factor.)
DUMMY2/p268/p268_398.wav|87|The arrangement will avoid any conflicts of interest.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_274.wav|7|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.)
DUMMY2/p231/p231_338.wav|50|There was no time scale.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_260.wav|95|At the time, he was a living legend.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_289.wav|95|My son was too young to die.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_240.wav|83|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_091.wav|51|It plans to return to this field.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_084.wav|40|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_122.wav|17|His three-year appointment begins on Monday.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_131.wav|67|There will be no shortage of quality applicants.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_285.wav|46|Working with him is like working with myself.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_217.wav|89|But she was.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_276.wav|51|Intensive care has been very busy.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_019.wav|98|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_101.wav|105|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_149.wav|62|I am so, so, so lucky.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_010.wav|17|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_141.wav|31|We have got to get it right.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_337.wav|50|The airport was even different.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_024.wav|56|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_048.wav|15|England could not take anything for granted, however.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_387.wav|107|You just have to accept.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_143.wav|87|It wasn't about her singing, though.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_402.wav|77|Motion described it as a unique event.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_079.wav|93|Today she has been released.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_210.wav|34|People love to see this stuff.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_360.wav|43|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_272.wav|38|She'd gone to the Catholic school.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_260.wav|61|Our decision making was poor.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_237.wav|2|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_148.wav|96|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_277.wav|0|It has the potential to be another North Sea.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_174.wav|10|Are you going to win ?
DUMMY2/p249/p249_086.wav|80|Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_379.wav|55|That could be ready within another nine months.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_143.wav|92|He certainly didn't say he was a journalist.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_304.wav|50|That was the difference between the sides.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_309.wav|91|This fact is supported by audience research.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_129.wav|75|Before it was an ordeal.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_377.wav|39|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_414.wav|85|We were beaten by the better team.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_112.wav|14|Athletics is on a roll in the country.)
DUMMY2/p336/p336_280.wav|98|I was shaking on the blocks.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_348.wav|45|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_263.wav|79|Do something that we need.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_085.wav|59|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_312.wav|29|They do not reflect the quality of the brand.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_146.wav|33|Mr Smith was dismissive.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_428.wav|32|It needs to be volatile.)
DUMMY2/p265/p265_184.wav|73|Peace was won.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_248.wav|20|There will be widespread support on all sides.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_298.wav|51|Mr Mason is claiming unfair dismissal.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_023.wav|10|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_183.wav|90|Four policemen were wounded.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_158.wav|72|There are plenty examples.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_355.wav|89|He could make it.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_454.wav|39|Legal opinion is that I may have a case.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_032.wav|35|The wedding was in Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_023.wav|84|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_380.wav|42|You need a licence to run a pub.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_189.wav|12|It was located on the remote control.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_095.wav|72|I am about protecting the state pension.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_126.wav|98|They have their own audience in Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_281.wav|79|I am really sorry that he is going.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_224.wav|13|No means testing will be required.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_211.wav|99|He is slightly confused.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_252.wav|85|They will not be able to come back, in my opinion.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_032.wav|22|The punishment was swift.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_139.wav|106|I was deeply saddened by the death of Donald Dewar.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_333.wav|49|There is no magical figure, but there are criteria.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_049.wav|70|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_017.wav|60|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_034.wav|29|President Bush is at war.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_203.wav|27|It opened last month.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_039.wav|37|And so was a photograph.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_059.wav|61|We were surprised to see the photograph.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_293.wav|8|There's always the next century.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_360.wav|63|I'd like to take the plunge.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_316.wav|64|Although it was expected, everyone is very, very angry.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_158.wav|57|The weather forecast isn't good.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_370.wav|95|There is a range of employers.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_156.wav|57|The home side didn't stand a chance.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_101.wav|76|This is my personal assessment.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_070.wav|89|They are real.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_030.wav|92|He's a good player, but he's not the only one.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_150.wav|18|Mind you, all was not lost.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_236.wav|20|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_017.wav|33|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_092.wav|4|I am relishing the challenge.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_067.wav|3|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_076.wav|84|We can all make a mistake.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_194.wav|68|We know them as mobile telephones.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_336.wav|69|The performance was excellent.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_107.wav|95|So, did she meet him ?
DUMMY2/p278/p278_346.wav|10|The Premier League has been a huge success.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_025.wav|14|They are very clever in their use of words.)
DUMMY2/p281/p281_202.wav|36|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_321.wav|75|All winners should be tested.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_072.wav|73|He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_060.wav|97|The problem is the book.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_048.wav|73|I expect a rapid response.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_407.wav|103|He came close to signing for Rangers, too.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_095.wav|69|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_154.wav|70|They have not been named.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_347.wav|9|The team for the first game could be this one.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_357.wav|41|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_182.wav|20|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_266.wav|50|Is it in the right place ?
DUMMY2/p304/p304_189.wav|72|The cost of war is more than that.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_362.wav|7|A Home Office spokesman said.)
DUMMY2/p253/p253_141.wav|70|She died at her home.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_386.wav|70|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_077.wav|100|He is in the queue.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_283.wav|23|The whole process was so different.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_028.wav|38|I'd just like to play.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_351.wav|38|We took the chances when they came.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_201.wav|99|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_083.wav|3|They were badly prepared for it.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_366.wav|70|It was a funny game.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_297.wav|41|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_375.wav|100|Does it matter ?
DUMMY2/p361/p361_066.wav|79|But we are very near.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_262.wav|103|I have no argument with Scotland.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_439.wav|27|We are now up against it.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_305.wav|103|Both agreed on the success of the event.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_186.wav|99|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_301.wav|3|But that's another story for another day.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_292.wav|20|It came as a surprise because my job is to go backwards.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_104.wav|10|Had I heard ?
DUMMY2/p374/p374_293.wav|11|You must be ready to play anyone.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_294.wav|29|But the plot is not the point.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_104.wav|4|But things are never the same again.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_373.wav|31|It's a long process.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_055.wav|19|Her role in it was small.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_033.wav|98|We are proud of them.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_013.wav|29|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_173.wav|0|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_307.wav|2|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_199.wav|2|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_054.wav|13|I'm trying not to think about that.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_245.wav|4|Everyone must be focused on the league.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_026.wav|84|But we will have to wait.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_012.wav|49|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_127.wav|30|They prefer the short, intensive session.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_186.wav|86|What has caused the demise of singing?
DUMMY2/p282/p282_332.wav|83|This is a friendly match?
DUMMY2/p333/p333_050.wav|64|Everything was an effort.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_126.wav|87|On Saturday, it was much the same.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_287.wav|90|It's very safe.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_400.wav|27|It is full-scale.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_001.wav|66|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_397.wav|96|I love the thought of having a crack at defending the title.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_381.wav|64|There are moments of honesty, too.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_356.wav|0|It intends to do so on Wednesday.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_394.wav|49|Partition is not an option.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_275.wav|51|He has lost confidence and weight.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_271.wav|79|It's not the tour.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_077.wav|4|I can't wait to meet him.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_030.wav|93|They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_035.wav|57|It was clear.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_070.wav|12|This is the way things should be handled.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_354.wav|64|Smith has not let him down.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_145.wav|38|They deserve a lot of credit.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_175.wav|106|These people are now following their own Unison agenda.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_223.wav|29|That might help a bit.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_400.wav|10|There's still no-one like him.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_398.wav|76|He says it often enough.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_224.wav|86|But it will be sorted out this week.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_290.wav|21|The princess has had other health problems.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_072.wav|83|Robin Williams is very subdued.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_196.wav|93|The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_310.wav|31|We have got no money to go anywhere.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_436.wav|7|George is on a two-day visit to Scotland.)
DUMMY2/p255/p255_357.wav|31|We will be homeless.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_107.wav|64|There was nobody on the roof.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_373.wav|29|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_327.wav|38|This is a dreadful day for Iona.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_191.wav|74|We haven't been able to go and see.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_315.wav|68|We couldn't go very fast.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_369.wav|87|It didn't matter who was in their way.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_196.wav|71|"Is that success?"
DUMMY2/p256/p256_086.wav|90|I first met him last summer.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_133.wav|30|I was just overwhelmed.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_361.wav|1|Today's agreement will help tackle that problem.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_173.wav|21|Is something which we just don't do.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_103.wav|99|I didn't play well last year.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_057.wav|8|Because we do not need it.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_305.wav|14|Tony Blair said as little.)
DUMMY2/p267/p267_061.wav|0|He was at home with his pals.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_416.wav|36|Does it matter ?
DUMMY2/p246/p246_181.wav|5|It's to do with context.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_021.wav|44|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_117.wav|12|Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_361.wav|23|For some, it might not make too much difference.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_144.wav|65|The eye was badly closed on Sunday.)
DUMMY2/p257/p257_133.wav|105|The whole thing of doing the movie was a risk.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_323.wav|43|He said she was mad.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_122.wav|53|England were ahead until two minutes into injury time.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_040.wav|48|After the match, do you ?
DUMMY2/p336/p336_349.wav|98|People want to learn.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_417.wav|56|There is a solution, she believes.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_068.wav|22|CELTIC Connections is here again - and the great debate.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_131.wav|72|No other offers apply.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_108.wav|106|People had been talking about a fourth quarter rally.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_060.wav|90|That's the truth.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_162.wav|56|It is also very valuable.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_389.wav|77|It gets into the culture.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_362.wav|75|It's only a matter of scale.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_177.wav|35|At the top level, the salaries are far too high.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_421.wav|7|I was happy to be recognised by Mike Tyson.)
DUMMY2/p317/p317_156.wav|97|I won't make an official complaint.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_105.wav|3|He has become a monster.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_158.wav|62|That says something for his strength of character.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_050.wav|13|What is the new religion?
DUMMY2/p339/p339_179.wav|18|He was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_042.wav|61|This film will be totally awesome.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_246.wav|58|That might happen in Pakistan, but in Britain?
DUMMY2/p343/p343_096.wav|21|The winner will be announced next month.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_002.wav|58|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_056.wav|53|They seem too much of a sure thing.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_316.wav|98|This is an appealing record.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_023.wav|58|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_185.wav|18|From day one, we were a family.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_365.wav|17|Their mind was already made up.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_279.wav|68|I bought a car at auction.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_085.wav|20|Someone who cares
DUMMY2/p277/p277_060.wav|89|It had been in place since last July.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_256.wav|28|My game just seems to keep on improving.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_127.wav|69|I can't even get into the A team.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_124.wav|38|He did his best, but it wasn't good enough.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_008.wav|73|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_224.wav|0|Does the name matter ?
DUMMY2/p256/p256_061.wav|90|That is very hard, alone.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_156.wav|6|We have been extremely busy.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_300.wav|37|Does the name matter ?
DUMMY2/p299/p299_201.wav|58|She told me to apply for the crest.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_473.wav|7|I'm very passionate about my country.)
DUMMY2/p257/p257_052.wav|105|But the law is very clear on this.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_109.wav|105|I did not think about the Ryder Cup.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_382.wav|6|It is something that we would support.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_359.wav|17|Brian Wilson, in case you didn't know, is a genius.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_086.wav|19|This process of attrition is expected to continue.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_194.wav|72|Journalists should make him.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_171.wav|47|It should be easy.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_289.wav|8|The manager's position was obviously included in that review.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_235.wav|52|You are not allowed to do that.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_235.wav|106|The partnership was set up during the summer.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_085.wav|86|Someone who cares
DUMMY2/p228/p228_157.wav|57|The amount of energy in a tornado is enormous.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_080.wav|29|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_036.wav|15|He was jailed for five years.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_008.wav|63|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_401.wav|22|I won't go back to Holland.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_352.wav|80|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_198.wav|105|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_368.wav|22|If they have City backing, what is the influence?
DUMMY2/p282/p282_031.wav|83|He was jailed for five years.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_214.wav|6|This is not a monument to the past.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_409.wav|89|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_328.wav|6|The United Nations must act.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_253.wav|55|It is based on population rather than need.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_141.wav|43|Our intentions are real.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_401.wav|91|I won't go back to Holland.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_001.wav|107|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_141.wav|50|I miss the freedom that I had.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_143.wav|29|So I got a blood test.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_027.wav|55|It would fit very well with us.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_200.wav|10|They are still very quiet.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_194.wav|8|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_393.wav|97|She kept him on a string.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_367.wav|54|Last month he made his debut in Japan.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_368.wav|34|There are simply no orders.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_213.wav|72|It was total confusion.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_224.wav|58|But the row refused to go away.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_294.wav|47|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_165.wav|50|We have a budget in March.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_053.wav|104|But we welcome this document.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_342.wav|103|There is great interest on our island.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_254.wav|41|I was never going to play against Scotland.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_083.wav|77|It was not an insult.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_297.wav|54|This is a very positive step forward.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_245.wav|15|The most important thing is the game.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_179.wav|106|You had better believe it.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_018.wav|97|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_094.wav|33|The matter is under discussion.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_218.wav|20|Because they didn't want to know.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_035.wav|90|It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_049.wav|25|It's easy to talk about these things in the abstract.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_253.wav|86|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_011.wav|94|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_073.wav|29|It is a terrible place.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_345.wav|2|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_247.wav|75|Was everything done to save people ?
DUMMY2/p247/p247_354.wav|14|That is a trend which will be encouraged.)
DUMMY2/p318/p318_175.wav|19|It was that kind of night.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_309.wav|15|It was published yesterday on the internet.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_058.wav|48|Among them are many criminals.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_012.wav|19|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_400.wav|18|It's not just going to be busy.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_292.wav|21|The clarity is vital.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_395.wav|106|North African countries are also seen as potential customers.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_289.wav|18|I think we could do well in Europe.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_181.wav|45|Nothing is safe.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_213.wav|103|We did not talk about it.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_089.wav|50|However, a decision should be made before the end of August.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_224.wav|50|They all made the European Ryder Cup team.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_082.wav|45|It's never too late.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_224.wav|80|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_204.wav|31|The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_151.wav|55|What do we want to do that for ?
DUMMY2/p330/p330_327.wav|1|I think we showed that after half time.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_217.wav|92|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_256.wav|2|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_067.wav|61|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_350.wav|51|This seems like a very good idea.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_233.wav|69|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_010.wav|27|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_324.wav|44|I'll go out and be aggressive.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_017.wav|94|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_171.wav|46|British officials said they could not say.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_187.wav|87|My father died in childbirth.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_215.wav|53|The study is entirely into the issue of future funding.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_158.wav|42|The man was pronounced dead on arrival.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_001.wav|87|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_280.wav|62|All were within range of Israeli cities.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_103.wav|95|We could not get any possession.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_125.wav|66|Don Hutchison, too, is a threat.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_294.wav|101|However, we had no failures in our side.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_160.wav|86|We do not get that impression now.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_034.wav|13|It was a deceit.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_064.wav|97|They say he wants to go to England.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_033.wav|16|This is the window.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_163.wav|8|There remains an outstanding damages action against the former.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_181.wav|104|He was, indeed, a thoroughly decent man.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_053.wav|72|Are you listening, All Saints?
DUMMY2/p244/p244_340.wav|78|The business is mainly active in Europe, the US and Australia.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_018.wav|41|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_398.wav|104|No other vehicle was involved in the accident.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_158.wav|100|We have to move forward.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_181.wav|38|I disagree entirely with the decision.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_366.wav|103|The position on the euro remains unchanged.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_019.wav|55|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_382.wav|28|You feel the pride.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_324.wav|47|I had my suspicions.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_160.wav|95|This will secure the future of our industry.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_403.wav|41|It was on fire.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_429.wav|89|Now, however, it has undergone a dramatic decline.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_018.wav|9|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_366.wav|8|My mind is focused on the next four weeks.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_113.wav|25|I was angry.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_297.wav|2|One was a lawyer.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_382.wav|89|At the last I found a bunker.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_076.wav|107|You do have a way out.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_291.wav|8|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_073.wav|84|It starts with the script.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_271.wav|44|It wasn't a conscious decision not to shout.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_260.wav|53|And they never show the same film as a rival.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_093.wav|107|That was a hard game to play in, very tough.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_015.wav|31|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_266.wav|40|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_241.wav|60|It is all very upbeat.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_152.wav|107|That sort of thing is long gone.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_048.wav|10|Do I have a favourite ?
DUMMY2/p272/p272_067.wav|69|I feel I did not have enough time.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_176.wav|63|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_031.wav|36|I'd just like to play.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_411.wav|77|It certainly appeared that way.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_270.wav|51|I'm not talking about his career.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_270.wav|77|We're trying to get rounded performers.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_170.wav|17|Last week, he was taken to the hospital.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_470.wav|75|Neither woman has been named.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_381.wav|58|I'm getting back up there now.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_177.wav|61|The release attracted little attention.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_175.wav|81|Everyone can be bought.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_011.wav|8|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_238.wav|39|We will reform the welfare state.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_382.wav|66|We have been working together for some years.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_108.wav|95|So what is the campaign about ?
DUMMY2/p243/p243_045.wav|53|Does it matter ?
DUMMY2/p318/p318_197.wav|19|They should feel ashamed.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_289.wav|48|This youngster is so exciting!
DUMMY2/p345/p345_104.wav|82|I asked for a picture and she said, No problem.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_285.wav|31|This is a national crisis.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_259.wav|102|It is the stop-gap before extinction.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_163.wav|25|I have got a wife to feed.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_108.wav|103|It may be argued.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_054.wav|53|The important retail business continues to deliver excellent results, Stewart said.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_290.wav|2|There was a vacuum.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_012.wav|91|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_394.wav|38|He sat down at the piano.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_372.wav|24|They should take their mobile phones.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_365.wav|48|The scientific debate is dead.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_027.wav|102|It is not an amnesty.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_255.wav|80|It is very important that we get the balance right.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_161.wav|93|It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_374.wav|1|He wouldn't do it.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_223.wav|58|Mrs Anderson said this one was different.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_278.wav|15|But it was to no avail.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_417.wav|62|I have to say, for me, the game was not.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_290.wav|50|They were on holiday in Egypt.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_270.wav|1|That is our main aim.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_321.wav|27|For the moment, our position remains the same.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_303.wav|70|You should be.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_355.wav|37|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_396.wav|56|He put some colour into Scottish history.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_121.wav|102|It is not a definite proposal as yet.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_113.wav|42|This ruling is unfair to everyone.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_302.wav|61|He should have won.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_229.wav|36|I'm just a regular person.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_421.wav|92|We are almost at that point, but not quite.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_057.wav|42|From our point of view, it's the right time.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_398.wav|60|The boat was fantastic.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_021.wav|63|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_113.wav|7|He was jailed for a year.)
DUMMY2/p227/p227_309.wav|29|We have the easy part.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_380.wav|87|Those overseas offices were great.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_253.wav|72|He wouldn't have played in all three.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_403.wav|22|There was no cohesion.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_183.wav|24|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_170.wav|56|It was a bit like having children.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_402.wav|95|The death rates are still as high.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_225.wav|61|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_420.wav|104|Mr Blunkett was convinced.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_105.wav|106|There could be a way back.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_101.wav|11|That was very important.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_128.wav|91|He was just awesome.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_034.wav|88|The man has already had too many chances.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_430.wav|39|Mr Reid said the repeal was a sensitive issue.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_271.wav|95|Do I think about them often ?
DUMMY2/p250/p250_167.wav|24|People were actually not on his side.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_232.wav|11|We need to think.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_155.wav|51|But we are not immune to the problem.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_375.wav|104|We need to increase the membership.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_190.wav|94|Does this matter?
DUMMY2/p236/p236_389.wav|75|My view has now completely changed.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_329.wav|78|Overall, we continue to look to the future with confidence.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_014.wav|37|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_036.wav|57|The problem is the pitch.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_331.wav|51|You have to think not.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_015.wav|52|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_048.wav|103|He was just a journalist.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_108.wav|93|It's a shame.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_297.wav|75|What do we want to do that for ?
DUMMY2/p269/p269_025.wav|94|She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_158.wav|39|There is no mandate for a regime change.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_191.wav|57|I put the drawing down.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_384.wav|7|The Allies intend to maintain the average.)
DUMMY2/p329/p329_204.wav|103|He was jailed for five years.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_052.wav|103|How can they engage with the work?
DUMMY2/p237/p237_229.wav|61|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_480.wav|75|It is a vicious circle.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_403.wav|7|It would be quite nice.)
DUMMY2/p300/p300_361.wav|102|Nato has completed planning for air strikes.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_287.wav|105|Graeme was prepared.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_374.wav|79|This is good news for the industry.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_346.wav|32|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.)
DUMMY2/p347/p347_055.wav|46|If he does not leave, he will be shot.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_220.wav|50|And the World Cup has not even begun.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_203.wav|8|It comes from reflection or thinking.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_247.wav|19|I wanted to put myself on the line.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_053.wav|87|The thought of playing in the English Premiership has tremendous appeal.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_173.wav|48|She is in good spirits.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_293.wav|1|Arsenal have plenty in the tank.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_267.wav|11|It used to bother me sometimes, but it doesn't any more.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_206.wav|56|It will affect their work.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_059.wav|106|He is too weak to move.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_128.wav|62|The pain is still acute.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_273.wav|76|There is no more money.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_410.wav|51|He feels he has cost us the game, but he didn't.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_217.wav|14|What was the matter for concern ?)
DUMMY2/p343/p343_149.wav|21|But when we do it it is great.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_234.wav|98|It may not be life long.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_030.wav|91|He had just returned to Thailand from Canada.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_286.wav|102|The law will take its course.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_444.wav|63|It's hard to make these decisions at my age.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_085.wav|23|There are plenty examples.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_110.wav|2|It was the eighties.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_219.wav|43|I might come back.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_053.wav|8|Does it matter ?
DUMMY2/p263/p263_029.wav|39|What do we do ?
DUMMY2/p288/p288_162.wav|47|It is too much for me.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_041.wav|95|She hopes to study in Britain one day.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_114.wav|20|It is a total and utter change of culture.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_046.wav|89|However, the decision has been welcomed by Scottish Enterprise officials.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_219.wav|99|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_020.wav|72|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_017.wav|84|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_075.wav|66|We have reports of this throughout Scotland.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_022.wav|46|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_184.wav|56|What do we want to do that for ?
DUMMY2/p303/p303_342.wav|44|I get to work with very good people.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_190.wav|19|Patients will be partners in decision making.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_216.wav|91|There are schoolboys in uniform.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_205.wav|29|They have the cash and the fire power.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_383.wav|49|There is a job to be done.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_399.wav|34|The racist abuse was terrible.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_295.wav|76|We gave them the goal.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_322.wav|98|No person has been charged.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_382.wav|23|A contractor was due to be appointed yesterday.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_268.wav|49|I have good memories of Glasgow.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_055.wav|70|Our people are ready.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_045.wav|105|That should do it.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_079.wav|19|They must be kept on the ground.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_017.wav|1|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_036.wav|101|It was a close call.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_169.wav|17|I guess it is down to focus.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_170.wav|103|There was even a joke.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_120.wav|6|It would be really interesting if they did.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_025.wav|40|But it failed.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_002.wav|103|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_288.wav|40|Bombing slaughter rejected
DUMMY2/p317/p317_076.wav|97|Morale is very high, despite the growing risks.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_414.wav|8|Stevenson was arrested on Monday morning.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_304.wav|87|They will probably come back.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_098.wav|76|Peter doesn't want to leave.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_258.wav|22|But they cannot go on ignoring the truth.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_414.wav|13|This was dismissed as absolute nonsense.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_252.wav|79|Colour is another problem.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_112.wav|59|Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_111.wav|107|Sadly, it took a tragedy to change things.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_268.wav|72|We then went to see the headmaster.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_168.wav|33|Well, what can you do?
DUMMY2/p314/p314_194.wav|51|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
DUMMY2/p283/p283_403.wav|95|A review is under way.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_379.wav|56|The pair are very much in love.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_354.wav|3|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_081.wav|56|They lived for their children.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_315.wav|59|They had a confession.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_367.wav|15|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_054.wav|85|We are going to New Broomfield to win.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_368.wav|79|It is really special to me.

DUMMY2/p231/p231_438.wav|50|They are not left wing.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_204.wav|11|It was so unfair.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_300.wav|30|The frustration was showing.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_142.wav|100|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_217.wav|49|This doesn't have to be our future.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_236.wav|60|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_315.wav|39|They had to learn to work from the consumer back.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_224.wav|42|The record companies have gone through the floor.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_384.wav|38|His death was a tragic accident.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_159.wav|94|I was so nervous.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_239.wav|32|Those overseas offices were great.)
DUMMY2/p287/p287_156.wav|77|The latter can only account for a small proportion of calls.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_253.wav|59|It's that kind of place.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_260.wav|47|Blood samples were taken.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_217.wav|8|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_317.wav|63|And that culture is everywhere In Dublin.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_139.wav|97|We can't have it both ways.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_051.wav|48|New York is my home.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_042.wav|5|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_127.wav|35|The opposite is the case.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_253.wav|33|Now the show is for public consumption.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_322.wav|99|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_270.wav|47|In fact, they have the opposite effect.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_047.wav|31|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_158.wav|60|This solution is not being considered in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_336.wav|42|It's an interesting title, Believing in Britain.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_253.wav|100|He is due in Israel tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_099.wav|5|No, the equipment is extra.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_407.wav|75|He seems to be used to the attention.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_199.wav|62|We felt at the moment, it was not possible.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_298.wav|13|I wonder if Rangers do that?
DUMMY2/p279/p279_255.wav|25|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_298.wav|84|This is a huge confidence boost.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_326.wav|6|This is an awful lot of money.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_389.wav|0|It was a funny game.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_323.wav|17|The result today is an impasse.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_329.wav|53|I thought the race was a little bit slow.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_006.wav|80|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_324.wav|94|We have got no money to go anywhere.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_134.wav|54|Being a taxi driver right now is horrible.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_264.wav|49|I try not to expect anything.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_259.wav|65|We were looking for a base.)
DUMMY2/p288/p288_062.wav|47|Scotland had great assets.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_247.wav|7|We will reform the welfare state.)
DUMMY2/p287/p287_207.wav|77|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_029.wav|63|It is about control of our economy.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_090.wav|93|That will come after the game on Saturday.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_215.wav|20|During the communist time they were very privileged.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_340.wav|2|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_057.wav|6|There has been a reduction in cleaning standards.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_315.wav|53|If you believe in the blue and white.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_368.wav|14|I think we'll just keep it.)
DUMMY2/p294/p294_412.wav|104|It was not known to myself.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_270.wav|17|And a film maker was born.

DUMMY2/p238/p238_424.wav|37|Got to get my sunglasses.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_157.wav|20|My Dad is a hero.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_284.wav|39|I was delighted with the way he jumped.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_282.wav|101|It was at the Royal Concert Hall in Glasgow.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_263.wav|105|And Michael was just great.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_187.wav|45|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_260.wav|44|I believe we have a good chance.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_287.wav|98|I had no experience at all.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_346.wav|18|So what was he really doing?
DUMMY2/p302/p302_038.wav|30|It's a delightful idea, but a distancing one.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_352.wav|0|Finally, he paid for the movie.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_046.wav|62|However, there could be more bad weather to come.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_241.wav|55|That's been the difference between the sides.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_049.wav|76|He was critically ill in hospital last night.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_437.wav|7|Even if they come out playing a physical game, we can cope.)
DUMMY2/p363/p363_226.wav|6|That in itself is a joke.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_181.wav|77|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_213.wav|46|Or some thought that they have.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_393.wav|55|There's nothing natural left.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_053.wav|95|That was the theory, anyway.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_140.wav|2|I was awful.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_105.wav|71|"I'm so angry."
DUMMY2/p286/p286_209.wav|63|It's very difficult to find a buyer.

DUMMY2/p335/p335_298.wav|49|A counter reaction was.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_168.wav|49|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_498.wav|48|Saturday's match was fairly straightforward.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_418.wav|42|Now he is trying to downgrade the media.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_097.wav|78|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_047.wav|96|It is difficult for Ali.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_123.wav|8|Those people must be accountable.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_023.wav|70|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_173.wav|106|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_137.wav|92|It was, for me, like a week in heaven.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_414.wav|60|And they went on to win the title.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_024.wav|41|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_091.wav|66|It had a gigantic effect.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_322.wav|42|I was pregnant and very worried.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_279.wav|74|They've had a good start as well.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_030.wav|17|The merger was welcomed by Tony Blair.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_201.wav|21|He said to give a local injection.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_459.wav|95|He was confronted by police.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_179.wav|7|You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.)
DUMMY2/p306/p306_250.wav|12|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_012.wav|17|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_241.wav|64|That is the key message.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_374.wav|8|They knew that I wanted to do something.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_286.wav|105|The home was now under new management.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_179.wav|74|They are just trying to cover up.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_187.wav|91|Ferguson had a most productive afternoon.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_343.wav|102|Does it work, is it safe, and is it right?
DUMMY2/p282/p282_337.wav|83|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_452.wav|36|They were good years for him.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_392.wav|53|Five years ago its return was rejected.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_155.wav|92|I'm sure they will be very happy.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_042.wav|47|We need to chat.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_234.wav|5|You should be.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_216.wav|84|The aim is to have the reports online by this autumn.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_045.wav|75|We are working on it.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_374.wav|53|It was another black day for Ayrshire.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_068.wav|14|The Farmer wants a new campaign.)
DUMMY2/p247/p247_282.wav|14|There were no problems with the crowds.)
DUMMY2/p298/p298_193.wav|68|It was not a foul.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_125.wav|105|I was furious.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_367.wav|77|Look at the Liberal Democrats.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_126.wav|9|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_229.wav|8|I am considered a teenager.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_083.wav|82|What happens next?
DUMMY2/p279/p279_158.wav|25|These days are long gone.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_277.wav|65|People realise we have a job to do.)
DUMMY2/p300/p300_244.wav|102|At that time, there was no infection within five miles.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_393.wav|105|It is not a standing army.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_263.wav|76|It's up to Ann.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_005.wav|89|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_260.wav|68|I believe we have a good chance.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_117.wav|75|But his attendance is not guaranteed.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_329.wav|79|Our own people are coming over on Friday.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_187.wav|29|He is believed to live in Britain.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_202.wav|106|That was just one night.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_343.wav|25|You need a licence to run a pub.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_003.wav|82|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_184.wav|106|I've no idea how it works.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_351.wav|76|That might help a bit.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_361.wav|60|That would be very good for Rangers.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_104.wav|52|They won't actually make any money from it.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_086.wav|66|You can't keep them separate.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_085.wav|3|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
DUMMY2/p271/p271_170.wav|27|The consultants report commissioned by the previous Government was not published.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_188.wav|69|Peace was won.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_231.wav|78|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_002.wav|7|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  )
DUMMY2/p333/p333_285.wav|64|I could feel the blood on my face.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_174.wav|61|I looked again at its vision for a Scottish Parliament.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_040.wav|21|And you know something?
DUMMY2/p311/p311_018.wav|4|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_235.wav|98|Everyone was in tears.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_025.wav|16|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_406.wav|63|The choice is strictly personal.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_176.wav|21|He will want to utilise the midfield.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_068.wav|61|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_293.wav|21|I could not sit in the stands.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_314.wav|97|Managers and clinicians must work together.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_236.wav|26|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_078.wav|22|He accused the Prime Minister of dithering.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_361.wav|53|The institute board will take the decision.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_072.wav|38|We are looking for volunteers.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_106.wav|79|I've done a lot in that building.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_393.wav|66|Story time is over - it's a war.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_085.wav|74|It is a potential danger.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_113.wav|55|It gets too much.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_097.wav|80|Every woman deserves to live without this type of fear.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_358.wav|82|This was a good performance.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_378.wav|4|We have to start again on Saturday.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_123.wav|98|These figures are truly awful.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_097.wav|107|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_402.wav|36|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_230.wav|43|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_356.wav|8|He was at school in Devon.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_334.wav|52|One royal, however, was himself criticised yesterday.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_262.wav|106|She had gone to the Catholic school.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_181.wav|35|He played it like a veteran.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_311.wav|81|The minister is the engineer.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_360.wav|79|Seven people were critically injured.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_042.wav|50|Among them are many criminals.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_155.wav|37|That's what happened against Ayr.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_045.wav|79|He was found again almost a year later.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_352.wav|99|He has seen the past.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_153.wav|31|The home side didn't stand a chance.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_296.wav|6|It will make a big difference.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_017.wav|68|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_430.wav|8|Thomson is expected to manage the business.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_178.wav|45|There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_319.wav|15|The timing is obvious.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_292.wav|95|My office is down there.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_209.wav|43|Now, it's all right.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_378.wav|84|The mood was defiant.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_047.wav|94|Who can say?
DUMMY2/p232/p232_108.wav|96|He pleaded for caution.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_391.wav|85|But what will we put on it?
DUMMY2/p279/p279_087.wav|25|This is the way things should be handled.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_327.wav|3|But it is important for a number of reasons.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_026.wav|44|There will be widespread support on all sides.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_316.wav|105|The boat was fantastic.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_380.wav|78|We are not going to fight in Kosovo.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_170.wav|95|Three hours later, the man was free.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_005.wav|94|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_207.wav|51|That night was a terrible muddle.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_299.wav|87|It has been recorded twice.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_412.wav|22|But who gets on the tube?
DUMMY2/p272/p272_165.wav|69|I've put my own money into this project.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_005.wav|35|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_308.wav|33|I've played them all in the Champions League.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_102.wav|28|If he does not leave, he will be shot.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_020.wav|90|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_183.wav|27|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_394.wav|100|I am a good player.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_244.wav|14|I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight.)
DUMMY2/p263/p263_203.wav|39|Who was she ?
DUMMY2/p246/p246_158.wav|5|I'd love to be like Peter.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_261.wav|56|I rejected the idea of a separate residence.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_098.wav|87|Are you from the rugby ?
DUMMY2/p228/p228_322.wav|57|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_228.wav|99|But he failed to win the committee's support.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_202.wav|61|Our strategy is straightforward.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_119.wav|32|I was on a roll.)
DUMMY2/p330/p330_021.wav|1|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_420.wav|63|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_271.wav|31|It's all change on the music scene in Manchester.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_384.wav|103|It is a dilemma.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_151.wav|23|Our policy is clear.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_397.wav|87|You can feel at home in China.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_169.wav|62|Who would be out there, singing?
DUMMY2/p248/p248_156.wav|99|That includes the equipment?
DUMMY2/p363/p363_158.wav|6|This is a big game for them.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_272.wav|103|Today's ruling confirms that fact.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_318.wav|81|The show is at an end.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_017.wav|64|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_218.wav|7|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.)
DUMMY2/p264/p264_365.wav|65|I would never even consider it.)
DUMMY2/p312/p312_049.wav|62|Back then it was hard to refuse.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_471.wav|14|At the moment, social workers take the lead on child protection issues.)
DUMMY2/p226/p226_179.wav|43|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_271.wav|82|They've been at it for five hours.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_052.wav|29|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_196.wav|95|The Hibs manager is no fool.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_185.wav|26|It is a terrible loss.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_360.wav|77|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_104.wav|90|Journalists should make him.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_373.wav|46|We're delighted about the vote.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_078.wav|59|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_401.wav|42|But every country has its own character.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_231.wav|77|We were a load of rubbish.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_390.wav|40|That set the tone.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_061.wav|3|You have to be patient.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_024.wav|91|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_399.wav|19|Actually, he thinks he has had it pretty good.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_284.wav|100|The morale of the Yugoslav army is beginning to crack.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_272.wav|107|I'm not sure how they got there, but they are.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_090.wav|42|We talk about effective military action.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_476.wav|24|I have always believed in myself.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_151.wav|76|Surely it can do better than that?
DUMMY2/p300/p300_274.wav|102|It does not move, which is amazing.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_252.wav|3|It was far from business as usual.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_274.wav|103|I'd never heard him in person before.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_026.wav|19|It is never an easy game.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_170.wav|33|They will be seen for years to come.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_035.wav|1|There were no reported injuries.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_418.wav|106|A, The media has been great.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_208.wav|97|Would he be able to live with that?
DUMMY2/p363/p363_162.wav|6|The baby deserves the credit.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_010.wav|107|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_073.wav|34|I mean they have just been a disaster.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_238.wav|81|The scene is about this?
DUMMY2/p301/p301_040.wav|91|Hopefully they will just give me the degree.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_190.wav|52|That capital would be provided equally by the State and established commercial companies.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_208.wav|45|It's a big deal for me.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_302.wav|54|We've been there for seven years.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_389.wav|52|He remains a main board director of Royal.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_405.wav|75|But demand for space in Edinburgh is still strong.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_109.wav|95|And does it ?
DUMMY2/p298/p298_173.wav|68|We are all family men with children.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_164.wav|95|What happened in that game ?
DUMMY2/p305/p305_045.wav|54|There was a fine line to tread.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_421.wav|48|It makes no difference to their friendship.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_267.wav|30|It's a matter of huge concern.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_098.wav|36|We live by the rule of law.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_210.wav|44|He had taken everything from me.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_185.wav|34|He accused the Prime Minister of dithering.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_240.wav|23|I have been here for only three months.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_067.wav|83|And if he hadn't become a musician?
DUMMY2/p232/p232_063.wav|96|You do not change overnight.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_016.wav|17|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which gods passed from earth to the home in the skies.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_191.wav|78|It is simply not true.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_345.wav|44|And we know that, because we know the hairdresser.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_287.wav|7|We accept the new rules.)
DUMMY2/p339/p339_320.wav|18|That was a fairy tale.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_260.wav|39|It might be sad, but it's a fact.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_310.wav|83|We have got to get the points from this one.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_171.wav|44|It's just that we see different things.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_238.wav|46|That is the key message.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_170.wav|7|The Internet is no substitute for customer service.)
DUMMY2/p278/p278_327.wav|10|The dealer is on notice.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_181.wav|91|This does not create any precedent.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_257.wav|18|It was indeed a night to remember.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_098.wav|100|I had a ball today.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_382.wav|8|What do we do ?
DUMMY2/p229/p229_021.wav|67|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_352.wav|9|Well, it won't.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_319.wav|102|I tend not to look back.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_055.wav|1|Scotland had great assets.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_060.wav|3|He looks as if he could be worth the risk.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_326.wav|24|McNaughton was not so sure.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_372.wav|63|I was delighted to accept.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_148.wav|59|That will do for me.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_052.wav|1|He has one son and one daughter.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_380.wav|69|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_396.wav|13|I'd rather have been playing.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_276.wav|37|They could not match it.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_005.wav|28|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_117.wav|46|Within six minutes, they were two goals down.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_369.wav|95|Last weekend he was awful.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_181.wav|99|The goals were good.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_191.wav|29|You know the sort of thing.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_231.wav|92|He has a wealth of experience.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_074.wav|89|But I've won both ways.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_136.wav|83|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_246.wav|98|It's time to say enough is enough.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_112.wav|73|That's all right then.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_082.wav|22|However, within those figures, income from overseas visitors increased.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_318.wav|19|That is the position the MoD has adopted.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_129.wav|96|The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_147.wav|93|They did very well.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_377.wav|77|There is a cup final at stake.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_156.wav|58|I am still very much a director.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_231.wav|30|There is no reason at all.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_198.wav|23|It ignores the future.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_086.wav|76|This process of attrition is expected to continue.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_358.wav|34|This is a United Kingdom.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_061.wav|9|They're appalled by that.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_104.wav|86|They will want to perform well.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_210.wav|18|Find them somebody they deserve.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_259.wav|14|You can never tell with the manager.)
DUMMY2/p303/p303_117.wav|44|And it's more subversive.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_140.wav|71|"The boy is no longer with us."
DUMMY2/p302/p302_223.wav|30|I had enough on.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_364.wav|39|It is the latter which has prompted the warning.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_370.wav|28|I'm desperate to play in this match.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_294.wav|69|One was a lawyer.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_408.wav|10|That is the ultimate revenge.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_178.wav|62|It was very, very dejected.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_043.wav|68|This is purely financial.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_088.wav|75|How do you take them away ?
DUMMY2/p335/p335_219.wav|49|She was a delightful person.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_094.wav|37|There can be no compromise on welfare.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_398.wav|17|My father died in childbirth.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_286.wav|21|The answer is yes.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_135.wav|88|There will be no exceptions to this rule.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_296.wav|68|Last night, however, other experts were cautious about the claim.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_022.wav|15|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_330.wav|97|It wasn't a flashy performance, it was very workmanlike.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_297.wav|16|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_089.wav|94|You will be.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_153.wav|89|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_267.wav|28|It should not lose out in any way.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_018.wav|8|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_199.wav|46|It's not right of Labour.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_201.wav|67|We are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_292.wav|4|The attack was totally out of the blue.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_356.wav|101|I said he was set to retire.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_125.wav|34|I have been to see him.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_461.wav|95|She has reached the top of her profession.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_362.wav|22|He will address the nation this evening.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_348.wav|54|I am astonished by this decision.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_299.wav|93|She said she could not believe that they had run away.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_091.wav|71|"We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football."
DUMMY2/p341/p341_357.wav|66|This is normal for him now.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_107.wav|52|They are a different team at home.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_111.wav|56|Then again, we could have.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_271.wav|89|If not, he should go home.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_007.wav|61|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_084.wav|13|He had a really frustrating time last year.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_200.wav|20|It's just awful.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_009.wav|1|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_001.wav|72|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_195.wav|16|It's all about money, money, money.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_404.wav|25|Quality Meat Scotland was vigorous in its defence of the labelling.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_306.wav|67|This is a war over our home.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_285.wav|29|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_056.wav|102|It comes on like a tidal wave.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_049.wav|66|Today is not about contracts.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_153.wav|83|The weather forecast isn't good.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_354.wav|4|So it goes on.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_054.wav|12|He was shocked by what he saw.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_136.wav|79|I've never seen anything like it.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_065.wav|57|It's that kind of place.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_310.wav|27|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_241.wav|47|It would appear that it has not been a problem.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_015.wav|84|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_097.wav|92|The mood was euphoric.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_304.wav|100|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_334.wav|97|We are not doing the Today programme.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_180.wav|97|He seemed to lose his focus.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_266.wav|21|As, indeed, they would be.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_162.wav|82|I suggest a new plan.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_209.wav|12|That night was a terrible muddle.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_317.wav|60|He is a sort of a mystery figure.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_173.wav|40|You had to go and see him.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_418.wav|85|This is the greatest moment of our lives.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_371.wav|89|I am a wealthy person.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_470.wav|48|This does not create any precedent.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_125.wav|58|He was happy, the BBC was happy, the listeners were happy.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_157.wav|42|Fatherhood is important to Tony Blair.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_252.wav|17|They were on holiday in Egypt.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_079.wav|52|The squad spent the night at police headquarters.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_191.wav|25|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_096.wav|32|In the end we made too many errors.)
DUMMY2/p295/p295_248.wav|92|It became a book by itself.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_129.wav|74|It is the same old story.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_168.wav|15|People also have trouble with the currency.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_170.wav|92|We've had an enjoyable adventure.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_245.wav|100|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_249.wav|53|My first New Year's wish is for him to change his mind.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_238.wav|21|Our positions remains unchanged.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_307.wav|43|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_248.wav|27|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_424.wav|14|Surrey police said no body had been found.)
DUMMY2/p339/p339_370.wav|18|But there are signs of a revival.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_064.wav|45|He was popular.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_149.wav|34|I said, What does this mean?
DUMMY2/p318/p318_260.wav|19|I read it every year.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_375.wav|76|That was never their agenda.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_272.wav|5|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_341.wav|54|I'm just doing artwork.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_197.wav|45|He's not written as a terribly exciting person in the book.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_327.wav|56|It is a terrible state of affairs.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_242.wav|26|It is hard won.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_323.wav|106|Does that put pressure on us ?
DUMMY2/p351/p351_138.wav|33|During the communist time they were very privileged.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_319.wav|2|Off with their heads.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_296.wav|33|Were they under-age?
DUMMY2/p228/p228_230.wav|57|You take a risk.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_260.wav|94|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_301.wav|46|I will carry on.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_047.wav|34|We have our supporters and our enemies.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_374.wav|47|It also highlighted some local hero districts.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_104.wav|28|We've all been there at some point.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_188.wav|104|This is simply unjust.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_451.wav|7|I never found my rhythm.)
DUMMY2/p262/p262_101.wav|45|It is a good lifestyle.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_185.wav|65|The single currency could well lead to a single tax policy.)
DUMMY2/p238/p238_304.wav|37|Who was she ?
DUMMY2/p241/p241_191.wav|86|The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_360.wav|107|We'll talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_342.wav|50|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_304.wav|68|Andrew McLellan is no exception.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_068.wav|91|CELTIC Connections is here again - and the great debate.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_400.wav|94|By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_105.wav|28|I'm totally horrified by the sentence.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_119.wav|77|But he admitted he could not speak for the new owner.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_452.wav|32|But we have built a platform for next season.)
DUMMY2/p303/p303_008.wav|44|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_177.wav|46|We might be back next year.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_208.wav|24|We have to be happy with a British and European record.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_264.wav|79|There is no other offer on the table.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_093.wav|84|He is in the US.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_177.wav|38|The new system will be marketed this summer.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_319.wav|34|Rangers didn't turn up, by the way.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_152.wav|13|This is the root of their problems.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_386.wav|62|I've no passion for any country.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_335.wav|83|They should take their mobile phones.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_092.wav|55|Put simply, it goes something like this.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_063.wav|94|It's that kind of place.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_151.wav|38|It is extremely sad.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_322.wav|1|We are all family men with children.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_446.wav|89|They have to come up with a solution.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_203.wav|20|He knows a lot.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_239.wav|70|Our policy is clear.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_265.wav|22|He was telling me to keep quiet.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_254.wav|56|No production contract is yet in sight.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_096.wav|83|He's been hit by it.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_276.wav|9|Today we can say that a new era has begun.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_406.wav|39|We must improve our relations with government.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_097.wav|36|We must stop it with the golf ball.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_183.wav|92|The deadline is real and absolute.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_074.wav|20|The party is up for it.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_034.wav|103|We don't know the scale of need.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_233.wav|12|He will become the sovereign.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_283.wav|31|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_136.wav|29|This is a limited market.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_162.wav|28|How do you find the youngsters?
DUMMY2/p267/p267_245.wav|0|I am still waiting for a reply.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_342.wav|95|The capital costs are modest.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_223.wav|71|"Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party."
DUMMY2/p254/p254_332.wav|41|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_171.wav|90|Waiting times for these services are too long.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_050.wav|87|The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_077.wav|5|He is in the queue.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_060.wav|33|They have been very lucky with the ice.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_395.wav|64|There is no margin for error.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_169.wav|19|But what are the songs about?
DUMMY2/p234/p234_220.wav|3|This conference was never confirmed.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_072.wav|11|I didn't mean to kill her.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_191.wav|43|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_339.wav|104|What's it for?
DUMMY2/p303/p303_074.wav|44|We are now in a safe place.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_043.wav|67|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_168.wav|91|As long as it is possible, we will keep going.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_370.wav|32|Does it matter ?)
DUMMY2/p262/p262_249.wav|45|It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_096.wav|105|The peace process will be buried!
DUMMY2/p231/p231_155.wav|50|The strong pound also took its toll.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_450.wav|36|Neither club is going to have much time for a decent runner-up.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_192.wav|51|O Neill has delivered.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_147.wav|13|IT takes the biscuit.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_048.wav|75|Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_448.wav|50|Sentiment was helped by the sharp fall in debt.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_117.wav|98|He, too, is keen to redress the balance.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_179.wav|3|I would like to see the figures  for the second quarter.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_031.wav|38|It was no surprise.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_399.wav|36|It is hard to understand.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_223.wav|54|The parents will have a great time, too.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_247.wav|23|She is fulfilled by it.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_416.wav|64|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_086.wav|39|Thomson is expected to manage the business.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_076.wav|51|I have got a knife.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_014.wav|93|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_264.wav|95|She claimed the day was for young people.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_299.wav|19|The incident is being taken seriously.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_204.wav|87|The refund is fully justified.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_356.wav|69|Four policemen were wounded.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_054.wav|51|That, though, is the measure of the man.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_121.wav|30|The trial is set for February.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_398.wav|98|He put a lot of effort into it.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_220.wav|19|Some of the players have not progressed.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_005.wav|3|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_003.wav|90|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_077.wav|76|He was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_283.wav|61|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_004.wav|1|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_212.wav|53|It is going to change the world.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_197.wav|36|That would be my view.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_063.wav|9|It was all in a short period of time.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_311.wav|13|We've seen that time and time again.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_148.wav|22|The fellowship is much more than a commission, he said.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_330.wav|53|If I didn't go for the world record, I'd feel guilty.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_052.wav|84|I was released after six days.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_281.wav|52|Analysts believed the market would welcome the group's plan.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_333.wav|77|Is there a waiting list ?
DUMMY2/p301/p301_003.wav|91|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_350.wav|76|I shall be voting Yes to support him.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_385.wav|35|If you can get it.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_121.wav|87|Or so the story goes.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_179.wav|105|Everyone can be bought.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_264.wav|64|Eriksson did his countrymen a disservice.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_206.wav|86|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_388.wav|25|I was in jail for five years.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_169.wav|18|I am confident of the outcome this week.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_177.wav|18|It is simple, but profound.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_086.wav|21|Both sides have been hit by injury.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_133.wav|85|It was not a beautiful game, was it?
DUMMY2/p234/p234_009.wav|3|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_298.wav|39|Its body language is all wrong.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_345.wav|37|My daughter is an adult.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_026.wav|11|This isn't some form of commission.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_299.wav|2|They are wrong.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_105.wav|6|The play was to go straight ahead.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_253.wav|82|THE waiting game continues.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_256.wav|54|But there was a shift.
