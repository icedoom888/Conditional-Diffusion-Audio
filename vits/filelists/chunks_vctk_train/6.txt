DUMMY2/p274/p274_366.wav|32|Do not forget about Monaco.)
DUMMY2/p305/p305_179.wav|54|He urged people to forgive.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_133.wav|3|He had no money left to run the club.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_398.wav|20|What happened in the summer?
DUMMY2/p266/p266_009.wav|20|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_124.wav|78|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_059.wav|77|So is that it, then ?
DUMMY2/p297/p297_220.wav|42|The first is in Whitehall, the second in Brussels.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_060.wav|38|Or so everyone believed.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_416.wav|89|The people around me were fantastic.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_035.wav|8|Costs have got to be controlled.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_325.wav|77|However, Walker remains determined to fight the proposals.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_193.wav|88|I would say the risk is very small.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_193.wav|49|I am delighted with today's win.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_161.wav|4|They never got into the show this time.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_393.wav|8|Glasgow University declined to comment.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_054.wav|99|They had to explain it.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_006.wav|68|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_126.wav|22|Tony Blair should get out more.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_119.wav|52|I left five minutes after he had finished his round.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_142.wav|52|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_359.wav|60|He has never let them down.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_132.wav|19|He is expected to be interviewed by detectives.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_300.wav|94|It changed my life.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_325.wav|78|For the moment, however, the position is clear.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_240.wav|3|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_169.wav|50|It is really good news.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_232.wav|92|It is a very beautiful city.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_354.wav|46|We will learn lessons from what has happened.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_089.wav|68|It was his twenty-first birthday on Monday.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_399.wav|13|It is surprising to come back this way.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_415.wav|33|His first album was a hit.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_258.wav|92|This is your country.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_331.wav|47|We agreed to disagree.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_054.wav|80|Next league matches Celtic.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_373.wav|69|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_153.wav|7|That group reported just before Christmas.)
DUMMY2/p276/p276_203.wav|106|This is a frightening development.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_385.wav|49|I am not obsessed with sex.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_025.wav|2|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_343.wav|91|Bob Dylan is getting old.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_199.wav|85|However, he was later released without charge.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_308.wav|0|The tournament has now been cancelled.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_277.wav|50|Share prices have fallen for three years in a row.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_256.wav|63|Three weeks later, he resigned.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_352.wav|66|They are just bewildered and very concerned.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_287.wav|74|And that is very good indeed.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_011.wav|79|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_416.wav|8|This market has been neglected by the whisky industry.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_161.wav|105|I've learned from my mistakes.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_019.wav|18|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_030.wav|0|We will look into it.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_076.wav|58|We've always had three options, and none of them are perfect.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_201.wav|77|Getting this right is essential.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_368.wav|2|So there, we won.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_028.wav|41|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_202.wav|8|I came home by ambulance.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_416.wav|74|I was frustrated here.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_193.wav|65|Do they think anyone else wants them?)
DUMMY2/p261/p261_369.wav|100|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_096.wav|62|The test case is still awaiting action.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_368.wav|4|I just did not cope with the pressure.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_198.wav|64|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_201.wav|7|It caused a lot of upset.)
DUMMY2/p279/p279_170.wav|25|Nobody did in those days.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_198.wav|13|You saw the pain he was in.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_240.wav|0|You will have seen the adverts.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_042.wav|12|A recording contract is on the horizon.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_064.wav|20|Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_156.wav|46|They've got a sort of unwritten contract.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_096.wav|77|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_230.wav|27|It's not before time.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_013.wav|58|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_140.wav|82|It doesn't exactly have the same appeal.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_007.wav|87|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_351.wav|95|Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_095.wav|27|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_210.wav|14|Losing in that manner is very hard to take.)
DUMMY2/p252/p252_132.wav|55|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_308.wav|9|Scotland were beaten again.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_309.wav|36|Their condition was described as stable yesterday.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_219.wav|58|It is anything but erotic, but that is probably the point.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_236.wav|15|You mean he didn't get the girl?
DUMMY2/p244/p244_076.wav|78|She did that for the rest of her life.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_313.wav|105|I came into this world with nothing.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_033.wav|97|But don't expect an easy ride.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_174.wav|41|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_052.wav|5|Here's a clue.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_078.wav|7|It gave no further details.)
DUMMY2/p249/p249_188.wav|80|We are very concerned about controller fatigue.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_172.wav|78|Details will be published in The Herald in the coming weeks.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_187.wav|86|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_308.wav|50|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_022.wav|25|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_041.wav|67|It is not for any other purpose.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_231.wav|50|Paterson can afford to be generous.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_356.wav|13|It is time for a new approach.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_037.wav|105|It was ugly.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_049.wav|68|However, you have just got to adjust to it.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_067.wav|51|Let's see that increase over the years.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_073.wav|65|Confidence is as low as it can get.)
DUMMY2/p244/p244_040.wav|78|She was at the top.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_246.wav|49|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_126.wav|37|What do they want us to do ?
DUMMY2/p278/p278_145.wav|10|It was his job to check.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_229.wav|70|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_360.wav|47|However, it was well worth the wait.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_248.wav|76|I thought they could have made the gesture.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_061.wav|89|Next league matches Celtic.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_285.wav|10|This could put pressure on UK inflation.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_045.wav|62|I certainly hope not.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_300.wav|103|In all cases computer equipment was seized.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_327.wav|99|The train was on time.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_076.wav|0|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_218.wav|102|Roy Keane is certainly the best.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_204.wav|51|Drugs are getting through.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_362.wav|50|You did not see it.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_342.wav|67|Today she has been released.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_248.wav|69|Is that a serious question?
DUMMY2/p230/p230_093.wav|35|But I know the course.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_234.wav|33|The way forward is working with other disciplines.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_100.wav|65|His massive advantage was never under threat yesterday.)
DUMMY2/p273/p273_349.wav|56|He can handle it without any problem.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_078.wav|77|The cut is excellent news for the consumer.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_342.wav|96|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_187.wav|12|All were paid by the taxpayer.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_263.wav|81|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_328.wav|15|It will be a new experience.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_360.wav|48|That moment when the monster is being brought to life.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_248.wav|35|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_180.wav|69|They need to look after themselves.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_024.wav|93|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_123.wav|97|It is essential that we win the game.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_297.wav|74|I think they have got it completely right.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_015.wav|12|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_085.wav|96|It's all going to clear the debt.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_075.wav|21|The script was funny.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_136.wav|61|They made such decisions in London.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_017.wav|45|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_074.wav|92|Lothian and Borders police are appealing for witnesses.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_310.wav|14|A tribunal would then consider the seriousness of the incident.)
DUMMY2/p310/p310_290.wav|17|He was at home with his pals.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_388.wav|20|Does that put pressure on us?
DUMMY2/p230/p230_287.wav|35|You get a lot for your money.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_329.wav|74|They worked on it for three hours.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_116.wav|38|If you're going to do it, do it right.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_095.wav|23|Her presence was almost everywhere.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_404.wav|46|The members have clearly spoken.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_029.wav|36|It's not going to work out that way.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_329.wav|54|I would have dropped out otherwise.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_407.wav|32|Nobody will be forced to work.)
DUMMY2/p333/p333_090.wav|64|It's a true story.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_401.wav|94|My husband was born in Zimbabwe.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_367.wav|70|There wasn't a goal.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_071.wav|13|I didn't think they would be that stupid.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_290.wav|25|I asked for a positive response and I was given one.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_279.wav|1|It is always the same, isn't it?
DUMMY2/p244/p244_288.wav|78|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_205.wav|81|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_184.wav|20|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_213.wav|96|He is slightly confused.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_049.wav|22|Lord Sainsbury is not a newcomer.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_038.wav|76|I'm not allowed to say that, of course.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_377.wav|10|The major championships will always have a special place.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_223.wav|77|It will now take over the running of the estate.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_067.wav|97|Wagner was never like this.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_316.wav|93|Let's hope it's an investment in the future.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_263.wav|82|I'm pleased with some aspects of the performance.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_381.wav|34|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_282.wav|40|It was a virus.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_074.wav|29|Even the one she loved.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_025.wav|34|We've made a couple of albums.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_183.wav|0|Aberdeen had little to offer.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_394.wav|64|If not, he should go home.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_196.wav|106|I did not concentrate on my performance.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_305.wav|48|They have played their part.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_397.wav|58|Jack McConnell is the obvious choice.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_194.wav|55|A child is not a product.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_388.wav|37|His successor was only appointed last month.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_183.wav|83|They need to look after themselves.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_408.wav|106|It has to be enforced.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_267.wav|55|He did better then.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_275.wav|53|It is also seeking a national mortgage rescue plan.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_295.wav|40|The tournament has now been cancelled.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_131.wav|45|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_231.wav|31|Mental health is a massive issue.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_250.wav|100|It is now the big brother.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_110.wav|66|It was love of Helen and the children.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_118.wav|99|But the fans deserve to know!
DUMMY2/p306/p306_346.wav|12|English is the language of pop music.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_103.wav|52|We were under a bit of pressure.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_151.wav|87|The move follows a review of the Singapore
DUMMY2/p275/p275_098.wav|40|There will be no repeat of that performance, that I can guarantee.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_048.wav|50|There was no safety net.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_041.wav|106|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_192.wav|34|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_303.wav|30|My friends were very envious.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_136.wav|80|What will happen then?
DUMMY2/p270/p270_079.wav|8|I first met him last summer.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_320.wav|75|Cast Away now on general release.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_406.wav|100|He has been in a nursing home for two years.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_329.wav|102|Three bystanders were killed.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_373.wav|47|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_189.wav|16|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_113.wav|91|The conversion didn't go over either.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_299.wav|16|I was the sheep.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_180.wav|38|I'd love to be like Peter.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_107.wav|100|So, did she meet him ?
DUMMY2/p308/p308_244.wav|107|I'm back playing football, which is what it's all about.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_075.wav|3|The talks were announced yesterday by Brian Wilson, the foreign office minister.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_197.wav|40|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_191.wav|27|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_040.wav|57|My whole life has changed.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_341.wav|68|Dancing will help his ankles and his feet.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_053.wav|83|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_051.wav|34|What's it for?
DUMMY2/p329/p329_017.wav|103|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_396.wav|97|That doesn't mean the Cabinet has to endorse.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_133.wav|67|She really suffered for her art.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_338.wav|27|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_279.wav|34|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_158.wav|104|The Treasury denied the claims.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_040.wav|65|I am secure in my owns position.)
DUMMY2/p268/p268_308.wav|87|Friday night was a pretty good night.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_339.wav|24|SCOTLAND has shown the way.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_338.wav|22|It was frightening, intense, and primal theatre.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_362.wav|60|It's something he has worked very hard on.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_040.wav|15|They had a confession.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_192.wav|54|This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_136.wav|98|It's very hard to plan for it.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_055.wav|48|He is too weak to move.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_320.wav|46|I would welcome a proper, public discussion on this issue.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_419.wav|48|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_258.wav|107|This meeting is the path to salvation.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_013.wav|63|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_334.wav|0|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_075.wav|99|He got the same story.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_357.wav|45|The council said the house would have to be demolished.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_331.wav|104|I'm so happy that she did.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_044.wav|62|This is not a monument to the past.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_004.wav|105|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_487.wav|75|We have to go for a win.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_063.wav|99|It is not great art.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_322.wav|35|The party lasted all night.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_271.wav|97|We have all been shocked by her death.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_078.wav|87|We should be able to cope.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_134.wav|68|We have big ideas.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_290.wav|98|Fame and money followed.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_168.wav|48|I can see it now.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_249.wav|98|I don't have any regrets about the edit.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_351.wav|25|Hartley should know.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_265.wav|4|They said we were out of touch.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_161.wav|41|It has been a lovely family occasion.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_028.wav|1|Surely history will not repeat itself.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_100.wav|106|THE Farmer wants a new campaign.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_318.wav|36|That meant the search was unlawful.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_018.wav|34|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_035.wav|34|Last year, it was won by Jack McConnell, the first minister.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_193.wav|29|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_008.wav|77|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_333.wav|89|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_329.wav|64|I am not changing my event.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_313.wav|5|We have got no money to go anywhere.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_175.wav|76|It was that kind of night.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_192.wav|95|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_346.wav|78|The banking sector was weak.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_330.wav|82|WHO would have thought it?
DUMMY2/p298/p298_147.wav|68|I always knew she was funny.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_319.wav|28|They treated me with respect and courtesy.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_057.wav|23|This is far too high.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_152.wav|75|It would seem a natural progression.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_251.wav|52|However, the figures tell a different story.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_347.wav|54|We knew nothing about it.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_129.wav|2|It's not true.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_215.wav|92|The distinction is also supported by doctors.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_258.wav|27|That could be in place by next year.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_423.wav|51|How come it is so often unnoticed?
DUMMY2/p250/p250_063.wav|24|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_222.wav|41|The boy is no longer with us.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_272.wav|20|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_028.wav|33|My Dad is a hero.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_108.wav|71|"Maybe this battle has been."
DUMMY2/p312/p312_101.wav|62|The scheme is hopelessly failing.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_186.wav|84|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_320.wav|7|Authorities have to recognise the risk of paedophiles.)
DUMMY2/p281/p281_034.wav|36|He should emerge as the winner.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_118.wav|53|The idea is the shop within a shop.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_301.wav|89|The letters are going out today.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_311.wav|44|That was moving the goalposts.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_262.wav|105|We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_390.wav|13|This was not helpful.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_120.wav|98|It's almost certainly not going to help.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_164.wav|89|I will tell you.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_202.wav|102|Well that's very New Labour, isn't it?
DUMMY2/p240/p240_319.wav|93|They were fantastic.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_048.wav|51|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_244.wav|81|It was a hit.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_292.wav|102|Everyone knew where they were.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_046.wav|57|We need to chat.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_019.wav|72|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_041.wav|17|Buying our way out is not an option.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_414.wav|7|It is the nature of his party.)
DUMMY2/p360/p360_054.wav|60|That will be important.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_010.wav|82|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_363.wav|15|They went down together.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_294.wav|50|Once again, they would be wrong.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_007.wav|101|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_255.wav|20|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_308.wav|22|They will have to make changes.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_183.wav|23|The crucial strike was yet to come.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_472.wav|48|We need a visionary producer.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_175.wav|102|You cannot eat in the dining room.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_010.wav|67|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_087.wav|103|It is a difficult thing to explain.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_047.wav|75|Everything else is a bonus.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_170.wav|35|One season, they might do well.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_141.wav|42|It is easy to agree with him.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_353.wav|20|She is free.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_256.wav|3|This is a sensible and common sense approach.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_188.wav|74|Clearly he is keeping in touch.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_408.wav|65|That view was confirmed by Welsh coach Graham Henry.)
DUMMY2/p364/p364_260.wav|88|FIRST, we had the Battle of Britain.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_249.wav|44|We can just get on with our game.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_243.wav|74|We just did not want to believe it.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_249.wav|16|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_101.wav|35|Before the game we went for a pint.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_021.wav|53|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_230.wav|44|This could be one such case, he declared.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_160.wav|37|His job was not advertised.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_226.wav|104|Advice and counselling will be offered.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_187.wav|80|Everyone can be bought.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_362.wav|16|Yet he left a few days later.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_167.wav|48|We have reacted well to each other.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_119.wav|7|We have the mental strength.)
DUMMY2/p361/p361_365.wav|79|I don't think so.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_111.wav|9|The fire was above the hole.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_378.wav|60|The problems began a long time ago.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_100.wav|42|The body follows the mind.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_251.wav|14|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.)
DUMMY2/p323/p323_037.wav|34|They discussed how he might get involved.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_363.wav|77|The idea was first mooted a year ago.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_076.wav|83|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_163.wav|51|I'd say we should give it a week.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_064.wav|58|How could anyone take issue with that?
DUMMY2/p335/p335_404.wav|49|Friends of the family have given their support.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_279.wav|20|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_114.wav|86|We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_335.wav|51|Again the parallel with football can be drawn.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_271.wav|48|Each case is treated on merit.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_273.wav|28|We should savour this, because it's unlikely ever to happen again.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_090.wav|67|However, it did not end that way.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_188.wav|9|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_044.wav|20|A neighbour said.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_204.wav|43|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_018.wav|10|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_037.wav|29|This represents a tough game for us.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_367.wav|29|Does it matter ?
DUMMY2/p264/p264_031.wav|65|I feel I did not have enough time.)
DUMMY2/p273/p273_350.wav|56|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_194.wav|42|I'm sure you all can relate to that.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_031.wav|3|It is on the internet.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_449.wav|100|He deserves a second chance.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_213.wav|38|The house was full of smoke.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_345.wav|36|I have a moral dilemma.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_098.wav|60|The release attracted little attention.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_154.wav|42|The observer saw no evidence of fighting.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_048.wav|96|But it might have done.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_179.wav|42|The first time you read a play.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_348.wav|52|And that is the bottom line - box office.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_082.wav|63|This view was echoed by the other Scottish analyst.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_089.wav|98|But who was driving it?
DUMMY2/p251/p251_323.wav|9|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_270.wav|3|This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_273.wav|34|We have to break that cycle.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_114.wav|72|We need to chat.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_148.wav|27|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_355.wav|79|That would be unsafe.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_084.wav|3|It is not a story.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_254.wav|45|I've had no discussions with the chairman or the board.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_340.wav|15|O no it's not!
DUMMY2/p361/p361_404.wav|79|The message was clear.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_401.wav|7|She said they would appeal.)
DUMMY2/p270/p270_420.wav|8|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_170.wav|90|Does that put pressure on us?
DUMMY2/p237/p237_239.wav|61|The way he took his second goal was brilliant.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_344.wav|15|He was their leader.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_377.wav|107|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_279.wav|51|It could be a danger.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_218.wav|91|These findings would be made public.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_288.wav|21|The second aspect was the fear of failure.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_272.wav|35|They are interior designers and architects.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_322.wav|40|Off with their heads.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_131.wav|60|Scotland, is an increasing concern for young people.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_372.wav|31|Yesterday the company reported a further downturn in profits.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_365.wav|104|Such debate is pointless.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_417.wav|89|I wanted to help the poor people in Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_066.wav|91|And she doesn't feel like Annika is better.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_136.wav|26|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_130.wav|59|It is not just about pay.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_323.wav|94|The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_023.wav|54|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_230.wav|78|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_039.wav|54|He came close to signing for Rangers, too.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_393.wav|79|But we are not afraid of them.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_075.wav|10|Petrol prices were widely blamed.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_294.wav|103|The referee had been right.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_055.wav|69|He is too weak to move.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_236.wav|3|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_347.wav|2|There may be reasons for it.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_254.wav|107|We are at a crossroads.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_386.wav|72|Many other areas are coming up.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_330.wav|63|It is a road of death.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_142.wav|20|She died at her home.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_051.wav|26|We have not given up hope.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_170.wav|1|It was his twenty-first birthday on Monday.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_229.wav|18|I have always believed in myself.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_135.wav|18|That question was never asked.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_413.wav|92|This is a really serious issue.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_352.wav|5|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_411.wav|91|Still, the experience was amazing, she says.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_429.wav|32|I never had a childhood.)
DUMMY2/p313/p313_329.wav|76|This is the logic of punishment assaults.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_010.wav|47|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_072.wav|79|The problem is not confined to the UK.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_120.wav|106|Choice is a good thing.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_402.wav|34|You can say he gets a sizeable amount.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_128.wav|40|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_025.wav|98|I am very happy with the result.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_100.wav|71|"We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors."
DUMMY2/p254/p254_261.wav|41|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_161.wav|52|This man could yet win over Scottish hearts.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_244.wav|17|He saw it all as a big game.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_357.wav|19|It seems very odd.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_226.wav|38|Sullivan was later charged with her murder, which she denied.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_200.wav|97|How do you respond to losing your child?
DUMMY2/p292/p292_415.wav|13|It is my decision and my decision alone.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_315.wav|13|It should be equal.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_052.wav|74|These people are not big names.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_263.wav|94|I am very angry.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_172.wav|22|The answer is mayhem.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_285.wav|8|It left me with a sadness.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_400.wav|92|He's close friend of Gordon Brown.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_328.wav|99|You were very proud that day to be among their friends.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_321.wav|39|Action must be taken to slow down the traffic.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_088.wav|7|Do I have a favourite ?)
DUMMY2/p251/p251_012.wav|9|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_270.wav|107|The outstanding issues are still there.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_255.wav|43|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_278.wav|52|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_070.wav|4|It happens in many countries.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_339.wav|12|But their bodies were found at lunchtime yesterday.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_216.wav|27|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_246.wav|85|It will be fine.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_014.wav|27|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_242.wav|72|She said she would not welcome the flowers.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_344.wav|75|The idea was first mooted a year ago.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_347.wav|96|Sex offender programmes to be retained by public sector.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_015.wav|76|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_207.wav|15|Glasgow is a very welcoming place.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_043.wav|25|Dancing was her life.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_114.wav|21|After this, they were always in the driving seat.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_243.wav|49|It's a record label, not a form of music.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_351.wav|59|A report is the first step in a criminal case in India.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_370.wav|99|I am a wealthy person.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_300.wav|22|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_068.wav|90|They may yet have the last laugh.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_231.wav|3|He is a good friend.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_295.wav|58|I am not a free trader.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_387.wav|92|It worked well in Monaco.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_298.wav|27|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_295.wav|82|You have to count on other people.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_095.wav|19|Of course we know them, from their work in the theatre.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_326.wav|28|It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_275.wav|88|Horses have some sense.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_177.wav|88|It's very very frustrating.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_110.wav|57|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_184.wav|36|They know no other way.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_352.wav|92|Worse still, it can be infectious.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_002.wav|10|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.

DUMMY2/p306/p306_001.wav|12|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_352.wav|65|That would concern me lot.)
DUMMY2/p255/p255_078.wav|31|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_036.wav|10|Several investments have already been made.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_203.wav|40|But she might be.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_336.wav|16|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_322.wav|31|I came into this world with nothing.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_318.wav|98|Only New Zealand has seen a similar increase.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_004.wav|54|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_298.wav|16|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_385.wav|0|Safety was also an issue.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_076.wav|27|Then followed a bout of flu.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_304.wav|14|He will address the nation this evening.)
DUMMY2/p273/p273_034.wav|56|The staff are as good as any staff in the city.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_081.wav|51|It had a gigantic effect.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_058.wav|102|Mr Cook, a left-winger from Britain, would be ideally placed.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_397.wav|64|I get very excited by that.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_073.wav|3|It starts with the script.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_137.wav|105|Our intentions are real.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_310.wav|1|It is extremely popular with families.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_089.wav|45|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_411.wav|54|We believe the squad will stay together.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_129.wav|38|We are taking advice on this.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_169.wav|76|But what are the songs about?
DUMMY2/p351/p351_093.wav|33|Only he's not as young as he looks.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_108.wav|9|I came to complete.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_249.wav|48|This season has been a mixture of frustration and fulfilment.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_174.wav|9|The jury is still out.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_082.wav|11|I have great respect for all my players.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_366.wav|31|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_083.wav|90|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_439.wav|63|Strangely enough I felt very sharp.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_344.wav|83|It was only a matter of time before someone was killed.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_209.wav|45|We'll have to work hard today.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_176.wav|88|I learned that only yesterday.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_109.wav|75|New Year will be very busy.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_249.wav|51|I'm very pleased with what we have achieved.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_171.wav|91|The problem arises because he does so much.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_094.wav|12|You had better believe it.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_257.wav|61|Chambers said he would accept the place.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_136.wav|46|I don't want to come down.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_185.wav|38|And what was that like, as an experience?
DUMMY2/p299/p299_121.wav|58|Council officials are involved, along with the transport industry.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_184.wav|44|Lifeboat is at the Tron Theatre, Glasgow, tonight.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_346.wav|38|The story was being repeated across Scotland.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_391.wav|7|They have broken that promise.)
DUMMY2/p276/p276_085.wav|106|Carlton also declined to comment last night.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_213.wav|83|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_101.wav|47|I'm not depressed.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_433.wav|56|Strangely enough I felt very sharp.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_065.wav|34|What the Department of Transport will make clear.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_185.wav|69|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_137.wav|72|Broadcasting will be top of the agenda.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_152.wav|54|He must have sat down, relieved it was over.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_363.wav|72|She is still very poorly.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_016.wav|27|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_081.wav|37|We should be able to cope.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_007.wav|104|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_452.wav|14|Blair is very positive at European Councils.)
DUMMY2/p264/p264_217.wav|65|Now we have fresh hope.)
DUMMY2/p341/p341_057.wav|66|So the process was refined.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_335.wav|1|It could have been just a quick fix.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_370.wav|6|And there are others.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_031.wav|56|I feel so desperately sorry for Gordon and Sarah.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_122.wav|60|When she went off it was quite amazing.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_019.wav|76|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_047.wav|0|Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_134.wav|71|"It was typical."
DUMMY2/p255/p255_164.wav|31|It is so unfair.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_149.wav|100|The point is raised again that evening at the Assembly Rooms.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_152.wav|70|The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_206.wav|71|"I had relied on him."
DUMMY2/p270/p270_295.wav|8|The partnership was set up during the summer.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_388.wav|45|They are good.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_238.wav|9|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_026.wav|53|His secretary said it was a matter for Murray Financial to deal with.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_137.wav|97|Tony Blair's official spokesman said.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_291.wav|95|I should think so, too.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_302.wav|60|I would not descend to that level.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_021.wav|54|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_207.wav|64|We didn't know he was even out.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_208.wav|96|Now, it's all right.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_283.wav|93|People have no choice.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_229.wav|0|Murray Financial has fallen at the first hurdle.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_038.wav|75|That means an extra two years.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_294.wav|3|Of further privacy, he had no need.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_272.wav|59|It happens from time to time.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_002.wav|80|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_282.wav|92|He's in a lot of pain, it is very distressing.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_223.wav|41|The track is currently covered in snow.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_307.wav|17|This is a long-term discussion paper.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_358.wav|18|Thereafter they were again in control.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_245.wav|28|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_142.wav|104|Where are they?
DUMMY2/p255/p255_169.wav|31|However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_080.wav|81|Who will pay for this?
DUMMY2/p267/p267_184.wav|0|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_242.wav|83|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_050.wav|27|Every aspect of our play was first class.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_043.wav|27|I hate the word.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_299.wav|53|He could understand both points of view.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_377.wav|64|It's been like that for ages, according to the guys.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_254.wav|11|This is certainly not the case.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_055.wav|23|It does not even have a staff shortage.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_048.wav|93|That period was a struggle.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_021.wav|20|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_325.wav|6|Was this element always there?
DUMMY2/p293/p293_350.wav|23|Famously, though, there was a catch.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_018.wav|52|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_295.wav|24|We shall rely on human beings.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_241.wav|105|I should think so, too.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_269.wav|34|The same goes for Russia.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_328.wav|13|He wanted someone young and ambitious.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_210.wav|97|I COULD hardly keep up with Professor McKean.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_127.wav|52|Now the life of this orchestra is very difficult.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_191.wav|61|It's a joke.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_255.wav|58|Before he left, the skipper said the crew were brilliant.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_005.wav|18|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_004.wav|23|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_265.wav|56|He could see no other bidder.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_086.wav|65|Because I was a very physical person.)
DUMMY2/p272/p272_135.wav|69|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_159.wav|98|Who do you think you are?
DUMMY2/p323/p323_029.wav|34|However, on the other hand, in principle it is plainly wrong.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_114.wav|93|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_366.wav|86|He could face a jail sentence.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_186.wav|31|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_336.wav|47|Finally, he paid for the movie.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_149.wav|47|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_395.wav|50|A review is under way.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_090.wav|21|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_389.wav|54|He also was in debt to drug dealers.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_336.wav|80|The train was on time.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_244.wav|19|This was done by the council staff.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_086.wav|37|We should all be grateful.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_075.wav|42|If they don't, they can expect their funding to be cut.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_008.wav|19|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_339.wav|4|And suddenly it became a free-for-all.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_215.wav|90|A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_396.wav|15|It is patently true.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_210.wav|69|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_174.wav|64|It was large enough to fit the wall.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_417.wav|78|It had been on the cards.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_211.wav|19|I suspect that it will.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_168.wav|87|We have reacted well to each other.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_380.wav|65|I have been going through a lot of things.)
DUMMY2/p240/p240_154.wav|93|I was in daily contact.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_041.wav|33|Will we ever play together again?
DUMMY2/p228/p228_108.wav|57|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_172.wav|5|If that's the case, he will struggle.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_321.wav|19|But everyone is entitled to their own opinion.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_344.wav|33|Secondly, there are other options for patients.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_277.wav|61|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_365.wav|41|Now, though, he has an incentive.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_189.wav|37|This should begin in October.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_313.wav|102|Part of Johnny was found some days after.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_213.wav|25|The road was closed for several hours.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_032.wav|52|Thomson and his family left court without comment.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_299.wav|82|I was a local hero.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_067.wav|12|If convicted, they face the death penalty.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_340.wav|98|It is a terrible thing to have happened.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_415.wav|100|It does not even have a staff shortage.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_236.wav|95|The research is published in the journal, Nature.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_338.wav|15|There are a number of possible outcomes.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_380.wav|38|I don't have a problem with getting older.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_371.wav|68|Top-up fees are not on the agenda.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_435.wav|8|It is not an inquiry to clear the athletes.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_317.wav|23|I'm confident we can turn things around.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_420.wav|24|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_296.wav|56|Do I think about them often ?
DUMMY2/p237/p237_011.wav|61|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_284.wav|84|They were on holiday in Egypt.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_238.wav|69|There wasn't a goal.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_085.wav|49|He was extremely nervous.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_111.wav|42|What was it like playing real people?
DUMMY2/p257/p257_193.wav|105|There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_393.wav|1|Meantime, his appointment has been widely welcomed.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_329.wav|41|It would appear that it has not been a problem.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_392.wav|97|My only ambition is to enjoy my work.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_245.wav|85|However, he said the money had not been wasted.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_058.wav|19|In a way he was.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_179.wav|104|He could tell you.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_369.wav|21|The warning was lifted late last night.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_022.wav|99|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_217.wav|1|Are there muscular problems?
DUMMY2/p241/p241_244.wav|86|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_441.wav|24|There were a lot of emotions.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_165.wav|83|I've put my own money into this project.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_188.wav|99|What has caused the demise of singing?
DUMMY2/p361/p361_334.wav|79|He should emerge as the winner.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_267.wav|25|I am totally horrified by the sentence.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_207.wav|57|Ferguson should take note.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_415.wav|38|More likely, perhaps, is that he will stay in England.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_065.wav|45|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_398.wav|13|Several others were absent.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_145.wav|78|Actors like to be in the centre.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_308.wav|35|His job was not advertised.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_272.wav|41|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_055.wav|20|We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_404.wav|55|What do they want us to do ?
DUMMY2/p262/p262_168.wav|45|The post will be unpaid.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_173.wav|26|It should be easy.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_179.wav|56|I came home by ambulance.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_287.wav|40|Police were on the scene within minutes, but the killer had fled.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_180.wav|81|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_169.wav|104|I enjoy my work.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_288.wav|97|Scotland need to work on two key areas.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_334.wav|53|One royal, however, was himself criticised yesterday.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_285.wav|56|Authorities have to recognise the risk of paedophiles.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_296.wav|37|But there's an upturn in the sector.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_244.wav|91|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_377.wav|74|But we wouldn't want them any other way.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_120.wav|26|There will be no shortage of quality applicants.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_283.wav|44|Meanwhile, Rangers will continue to search for a striker.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_281.wav|4|I am very happy with life.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_084.wav|98|It will be easier for us.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_162.wav|90|It has to be now.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_272.wav|93|Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_035.wav|11|We are expecting a big crowd.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_195.wav|107|Public confidence was undermined by that terrible tragedy.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_392.wav|54|The love affair was over.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_078.wav|6|We did not deserve to go through.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_345.wav|76|Staff have been informed.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_239.wav|7|They are difficult awards to decide.)
DUMMY2/p263/p263_124.wav|39|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_381.wav|97|There will be two other areas of contention.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_174.wav|97|It obviously changes the prospects for getting agreement.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_247.wav|18|Did it work?
DUMMY2/p364/p364_037.wav|88|It isn't a free-for-all.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_309.wav|5|The minister is the engineer.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_313.wav|28|They should use it on the catwalk.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_293.wav|78|This idea has been around for four years.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_081.wav|85|The company yesterday refused to comment.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_107.wav|54|The research is published in the journal, Nature.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_312.wav|81|The letters are going out today.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_241.wav|42|Every game against New Zealand is.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_141.wav|44|It's a bit like a bereavement.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_299.wav|34|We were a little bit nervous.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_330.wav|15|She asked for the appointment with me.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_217.wav|28|He scored a touchdown.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_043.wav|86|That period was a struggle.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_256.wav|0|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_140.wav|69|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_191.wav|47|I wanted to put myself on the line.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_367.wav|51|Filtering through this material a composite finally emerges.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_293.wav|106|That would open the gates of hell.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_021.wav|41|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_267.wav|46|I'm quite embarrassed and ashamed of doing that.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_407.wav|54|See it while you can.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_259.wav|72|I felt he was excellent.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_423.wav|64|I don't know why you say goodbye.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_433.wav|8|We know about the crisis in cattle.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_082.wav|93|What has changed?
DUMMY2/p330/p330_373.wav|1|He scored a touchdown.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_146.wav|103|That left a bad taste in my mouth.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_201.wav|59|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_315.wav|29|His job was not advertised.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_348.wav|35|There was no time scale.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_339.wav|14|The election is total confusion and chaos.)
DUMMY2/p229/p229_061.wav|67|Art is extra.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_419.wav|103|We've come from a long way back.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_369.wav|77|It is a stroke of genius.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_310.wav|48|Racism has no place in any sport.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_372.wav|14|He had no previous convictions.)
DUMMY2/p285/p285_326.wav|2|He scored a touchdown.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_029.wav|54|Which brings us to the Scottish connection.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_050.wav|25|The judge said.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_247.wav|24|The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_146.wav|46|But the cost to his health was enormous.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_322.wav|58|Soon the whole country will be level.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_084.wav|54|This season has been great for me, it's been an experience.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_367.wav|34|But we're not the same person.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_075.wav|77|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_088.wav|45|This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_078.wav|95|Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_173.wav|88|England will be under a lot of pressure.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_386.wav|40|I love the thought of having a crack at the defending title.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_061.wav|61|I've had six days of rehearsal.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_403.wav|47|What would be the point?
DUMMY2/p263/p263_378.wav|39|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_375.wav|63|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_294.wav|71|"He has retired."
DUMMY2/p363/p363_257.wav|6|We would like to see them in court.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_201.wav|3|They have to get that sorted.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_329.wav|2|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_056.wav|50|Italy is a beautiful place.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_376.wav|41|We felt at the moment, it was not possible.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_344.wav|31|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_016.wav|36|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_014.wav|52|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_040.wav|2|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_094.wav|51|They are completely different from each other.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_251.wav|21|We will turn the corner.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_311.wav|61|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_220.wav|24|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_280.wav|81|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_105.wav|8|I understand the medical concerns.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_168.wav|4|The criteria have changed.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_375.wav|35|Scrutiny by European Parliament is limited.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_150.wav|94|She died at her home.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_251.wav|41|There will be widespread support on all sides.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_119.wav|66|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_178.wav|11|There's no reason for panic.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_126.wav|93|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_339.wav|106|Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_405.wav|76|The Open champion is back.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_356.wav|59|It's not that clear-cut.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_427.wav|48|This idea has been around for four years.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_037.wav|38|Darrell was, however, adamant.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_233.wav|82|The game was up.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_257.wav|78|It was really good in the first week.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_155.wav|24|Are you going to win ?
DUMMY2/p288/p288_321.wav|47|The home team had an amazing start.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_112.wav|38|It didn't take long.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_057.wav|61|I was inspired by two things.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_177.wav|71|"It is the whole package."
DUMMY2/p239/p239_028.wav|48|We are not aware of any British casualties at this stage.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_348.wav|43|Look at the witnesses.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_128.wav|45|Nobody in the world can get away from him.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_267.wav|88|We try to keep it right.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_157.wav|107|Smaller parties have reason to be pleased.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_412.wav|50|I will always remember the horrible images.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_294.wav|18|But it will not work again.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_183.wav|99|Four policemen were wounded.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_388.wav|58|She always wanted her own way.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_277.wav|49|There is great demand for human cloning.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_323.wav|93|Henman has been warned.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_416.wav|106|A succession of managers in the opera company resigned.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_330.wav|6|He was a national treasure.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_310.wav|37|We are trying to clarify the issues.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_357.wav|60|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_199.wav|6|Well, you might have a point.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_095.wav|15|Sure, this is a very important event for me.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_015.wav|72|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_020.wav|77|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_165.wav|4|There was nothing else to match it.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_110.wav|83|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_192.wav|88|Despite that, it was a great day for me.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_384.wav|104|We had our chances.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_243.wav|34|The result could be all down to turnout.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_078.wav|65|That is very important.)
DUMMY2/p279/p279_235.wav|25|It is set in Paris.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_364.wav|67|It was fit for royalty.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_173.wav|52|If successful, several records will be made.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_252.wav|103|I have no comment to make.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_273.wav|101|He has not created a Festival resource.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_101.wav|66|That meant the search was unlawful.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_416.wav|48|You're not getting any goodwill.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_009.wav|66|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_446.wav|95|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_041.wav|34|We know the quality of life goes up.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_016.wav|98|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_373.wav|74|War is not the action.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_230.wav|8|There's a chance they might come down.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_405.wav|74|He said no survivors had been found.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_301.wav|61|That could change.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_146.wav|62|It's easy to see why.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_079.wav|59|We have other options.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_391.wav|82|There is ample evidence.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_080.wav|2|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_313.wav|54|I feel privileged to be here.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_380.wav|54|He was released in March this year.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_037.wav|106|We speak about the performance.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_139.wav|41|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_314.wav|96|We are a peaceful people.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_084.wav|62|There are many children.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_394.wav|97|The committees are due to report next year.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_346.wav|28|It is also claimed that he was murdered.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_266.wav|60|He was pleased with his display.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_079.wav|35|By then, he was walking on water.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_030.wav|90|I was an athlete.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_141.wav|99|He has the edge.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_186.wav|44|Charles Clarke is an idiot.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_070.wav|93|We welcome the decision of Mr Byers.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_022.wav|24|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_318.wav|74|They have not changed at all.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_171.wav|54|It is scheduled to go ahead next Saturday.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_339.wav|92|However, that could alter following the latest case.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_298.wav|22|We are aware of the tribunal case.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_178.wav|86|I drove the ball well.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_339.wav|85|It's a national sport.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_441.wav|50|We shall not forget him.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_267.wav|60|The first time you read a play.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_192.wav|62|I was a bit nervous.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_313.wav|81|We want to play at the worlds.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_399.wav|94|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_298.wav|32|You have to expect this type of thing.)
DUMMY2/p261/p261_373.wav|100|What do they want us to do ?
DUMMY2/p246/p246_071.wav|5|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_247.wav|76|I wanted to put myself on the line.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_242.wav|92|Hopefully we can put in a performance.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_071.wav|84|She did that for the rest of her life.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_172.wav|91|The answer is mayhem.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_463.wav|63|We are now up against it.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_384.wav|27|It's a real problem.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_223.wav|80|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_134.wav|79|It's a matter for the Committee.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_150.wav|47|It was so new, so exciting.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_006.wav|33|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_224.wav|73|Until they came to do it.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_212.wav|60|Pensions are a long-term investment.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_228.wav|41|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_250.wav|66|I'll go back home and see my family.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_305.wav|69|We are a peaceful people.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_121.wav|80|This is the end of a chapter, and it is very sad.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_328.wav|96|They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_043.wav|33|He is keen to stay in public service.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_300.wav|86|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_064.wav|31|We welcome the decision of Mr Byers.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_299.wav|79|Again, there was no detail.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_199.wav|9|It's the same old story.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_287.wav|55|They were seriously after him.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_038.wav|46|We have nothing to say about that.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_266.wav|55|Look at a computer.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_058.wav|14|How are you, sir ?)
DUMMY2/p326/p326_094.wav|28|That'd be good for the whole city.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_232.wav|4|We have to defend ourselves.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_025.wav|102|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_425.wav|95|Yet the data is compelling.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_239.wav|92|His remarks appear to have had an effect.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_440.wav|50|They said they were only young men.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_356.wav|46|Again, this was genuine loyalty being recognised.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_248.wav|42|I've not said anything to them, they know.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_330.wav|19|We are now in an election period.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_384.wav|17|And they all had these other commitments.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_243.wav|31|We were awful.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_102.wav|30|Does it feel like the ideas and emotions?
DUMMY2/p374/p374_113.wav|11|We are at an advanced stage, and are now instructing counsel.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_029.wav|44|I was never going to play against Scotland.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_167.wav|106|Before the game we went for a pint.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_295.wav|106|We've made a couple of albums.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_178.wav|58|He admitted there were two aspects of fear.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_280.wav|67|I am an estate agent.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_315.wav|18|That is an entirely different discipline.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_093.wav|13|We are pursuing legal action against the government.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_270.wav|19|That's what we're trying to achieve.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_201.wav|88|Our destiny is in our own hands.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_452.wav|24|The villagers were shot in the head at short range.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_311.wav|90|This is the culture change in medicine.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_178.wav|26|They will run a mile.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_027.wav|79|He may not need to force that message.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_289.wav|9|We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_284.wav|65|It's not a small step.)
DUMMY2/p232/p232_405.wav|96|We have not yet received a letter from the Irish.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_207.wav|30|Why should we even be asked to share?
DUMMY2/p339/p339_243.wav|18|I could have been killed on that day.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_098.wav|99|Two of the team became ill.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_164.wav|72|And there is no cause for it.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_363.wav|14|It is understood the timescale for the refurbishment has slipped.)
DUMMY2/p305/p305_027.wav|54|We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_362.wav|89|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_130.wav|16|It plans to return to this field.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_079.wav|40|He had suffered a heart attack.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_225.wav|104|Gas is too expensive.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_395.wav|1|Mr Burrell was arrested almost a year ago.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_133.wav|31|The Scottish Socialist party is also expected to attend.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_359.wav|16|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_386.wav|11|For tragedy it is.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_081.wav|106|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
DUMMY2/p244/p244_423.wav|78|He's had to suffer for the last six years.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_143.wav|9|We just had a go.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_281.wav|11|We are delighted with that.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_131.wav|27|What will happen then?
DUMMY2/p253/p253_241.wav|70|The scene is about this?
DUMMY2/p247/p247_477.wav|14|The casting of her husband was an accident.)
DUMMY2/p275/p275_419.wav|40|There is no suggestion of any sinister intent on his behalf.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_282.wav|30|I see no need for change.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_027.wav|44|This was the classical period of Beethoven.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_280.wav|44|And who were they anyway, beforehand?
DUMMY2/p283/p283_442.wav|95|We shall not forget him.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_093.wav|38|There are a lot of unanswered questions.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_234.wav|74|They didn't find any substance.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_071.wav|33|It's really good, as long as we play well.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_370.wav|106|The Reporter appears to have undue influence on the panel.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_269.wav|70|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_271.wav|67|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_368.wav|87|Weather should not be a factor.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_167.wav|13|It was the first time they met.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_305.wav|83|The letters are going out today.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_435.wav|95|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_193.wav|56|It gave no further details.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_174.wav|17|He put a lot of effort into it.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_117.wav|63|But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_071.wav|82|I had to lie.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_168.wav|65|Everything people said about it was true.)
DUMMY2/p245/p245_137.wav|59|Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_032.wav|83|Help is needed.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_357.wav|78|They were impressive against France.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_406.wav|34|A decision about that will be made today.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_413.wav|85|I have never been overly ambitious.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_042.wav|55|We took part in a festival called Global Dance.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_046.wav|90|That period was a struggle.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_487.wav|24|The processing plant was closed yesterday.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_237.wav|22|Why does she suddenly win everything now?
DUMMY2/p374/p374_310.wav|11|And also, whatever he does, can he really win?
DUMMY2/p253/p253_299.wav|70|It could work.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_200.wav|17|They responded with victories.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_251.wav|8|I might get an injury very easily.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_013.wav|10|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_356.wav|103|We do not expect any surplus.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_302.wav|4|My position on the euro is quite clear.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_171.wav|65|It is a large number.)
DUMMY2/p340/p340_244.wav|74|The medal itself is not that important.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_207.wav|66|She told me to apply for the crest.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_213.wav|74|It was properly reported to us.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_296.wav|91|He or she will oversee the leadership contest.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_080.wav|37|We have to keep our clients.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_043.wav|50|He looks like an Afghan.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_162.wav|34|I don't know what we're doing wrong.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_154.wav|51|We haven't seen from the Bank of Scotland.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_038.wav|19|I'm not allowed to say that, of course.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_133.wav|57|This plan is an agenda for action.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_210.wav|89|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_315.wav|43|It was a question of patience.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_281.wav|94|He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_390.wav|24|After the match, do you ?
DUMMY2/p255/p255_022.wav|31|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_304.wav|15|He added, We are full of anger.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_284.wav|79|We have been here before.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_160.wav|27|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_089.wav|79|We all want to be left alone.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_224.wav|101|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_314.wav|18|They were following his orders.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_162.wav|36|It is a terrible tragedy.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_130.wav|82|As to rugby, well, no-one knows.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_283.wav|52|He may be ready for first team action in March.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_142.wav|51|That's the sort of game you want.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_205.wav|86|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_363.wav|62|He can do everything.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_111.wav|25|O Neill is caught between a rock and a hard place.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_352.wav|53|Sales will begin by the end of October.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_259.wav|106|Kingfisher reports interim figures tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_081.wav|2|It is a blow.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_078.wav|70|The party is up for it.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_254.wav|96|Some families have even requested to leave the city.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_208.wav|11|No, it's actually in a block of flats.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_122.wav|68|I've got no secret.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_281.wav|37|First, the programme was unbalanced.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_249.wav|38|That's why they go to the opera.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_158.wav|58|But we are severely limited in funds.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_346.wav|84|On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_276.wav|36|We feel very good about it.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_328.wav|48|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_284.wav|57|It changed my life.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_230.wav|67|Who was on the panel ?
DUMMY2/p230/p230_414.wav|35|It is the old story.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_064.wav|53|It also has a good labour supply.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_347.wav|38|An appeal was made to the presiding officer.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_147.wav|86|The home side didn't stand a chance.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_116.wav|94|My office is bare.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_146.wav|96|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_323.wav|84|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_416.wav|105|Rather than answer, she resigned.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_149.wav|74|And he listens to his artists as well.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_193.wav|23|This is simply unjust.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_448.wav|65|Powers looks straight ahead.)
DUMMY2/p318/p318_242.wav|19|I tried to push him away.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_327.wav|89|Two people were interviewed.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_240.wav|4|It's not that clear-cut.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_309.wav|99|He then asked if he could have her seat and she refused.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_078.wav|62|However, there would be no permanent displays.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_043.wav|82|However, there were some alarming findings.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_015.wav|93|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_410.wav|56|We decided we would go for a specialist inside centre.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_259.wav|91|We would love for him to stay, but he's going home.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_365.wav|67|We are looking for perfection.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_075.wav|49|We should do everything at a stroke.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_227.wav|76|That figure will always remain with me.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_342.wav|2|They should take their mobile phones.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_173.wav|33|Sadly, they don't seem to know.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_067.wav|29|I have proved that in the past.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_067.wav|73|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_385.wav|46|They didn't find anything.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_081.wav|29|By then, he was walking on water.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_026.wav|81|We will be homeless.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_021.wav|31|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_112.wav|35|We have the mental strength.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_210.wav|0|The course has helped a lot.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_095.wav|8|We should recognise that others have done a good job.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_248.wav|43|I was shocked.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_135.wav|20|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_144.wav|1|Was society doing enough?
DUMMY2/p335/p335_112.wav|49|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_364.wav|107|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_177.wav|77|People like to talk about these things.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_220.wav|53|I was independent but I am not now.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_166.wav|38|Scottish Women appear at Eden Court, Inverness, tonight.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_340.wav|66|Two years ago, the commission did not want to get involved.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_053.wav|6|So now we know.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_024.wav|69|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_124.wav|61|I felt very strongly that England should have it.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_155.wav|58|Nor does it have a stock of medicines.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_387.wav|13|Billy knew he was attracted to women.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_067.wav|98|For one thing, he was growing far too quickly.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_135.wav|48|Last weekend was extremely frustrating.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_017.wav|76|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_140.wav|47|The selection process is still at a very early stage.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_257.wav|69|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_399.wav|77|What do they want us to do ?
DUMMY2/p248/p248_019.wav|99|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_289.wav|43|This is a national crisis.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_214.wav|46|He has lost confidence and weight.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_244.wav|5|We will need to study the report before any decision is taken.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_242.wav|96|It's quite a line-up!
DUMMY2/p253/p253_089.wav|70|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_271.wav|15|This is not a crisis.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_464.wav|24|The damage is all inside.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_009.wav|47|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_060.wav|0|We need to increase the membership.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_022.wav|63|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_063.wav|30|The quality of life is difficult for them.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_082.wav|51|On that basis, he would set it aside.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_271.wav|36|On the contrary they stand to gain.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_356.wav|6|This place is outstanding.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_330.wav|49|The whole thing would be perfect.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_224.wav|24|What are you not good at ?
DUMMY2/p275/p275_270.wav|40|It was very fast.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_177.wav|44|There was pressure from elsewhere too.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_177.wav|31|Waiting times for these services are too long.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_328.wav|92|They have been contrasting years, certainly.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_169.wav|55|Traffic was also heavy around Strathclyde Park.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_281.wav|56|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_233.wav|95|This is a holy place.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_056.wav|99|But the law is very clear on this.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_034.wav|32|Several investments have already been made.)
DUMMY2/p266/p266_098.wav|20|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_223.wav|68|Now, however, it has undergone a dramatic decline.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_139.wav|93|It seems so long since I did the exams.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_402.wav|24|Theatre is not a museum.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_128.wav|66|It is crucial for both teams.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_041.wav|91|It doesn't make them evil.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_086.wav|68|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_137.wav|75|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_061.wav|98|It is not standing army.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_255.wav|60|Who would have thought it?
DUMMY2/p292/p292_343.wav|13|And right now, it isn't there.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_315.wav|42|The actor has met with Mandela.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_361.wav|62|It's been an extremely frustrating year for me.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_212.wav|101|After that nothing could save him.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_171.wav|73|It's an idea.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_114.wav|40|The mood is upbeat.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_214.wav|17|In her opinion, the rich are different.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_147.wav|5|I am just trying to do my job.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_389.wav|4|Normally, they have been a pack of lies.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_094.wav|38|Libya is an easy target.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_300.wav|79|Let the voters decide.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_234.wav|60|So what's it all about?
DUMMY2/p284/p284_187.wav|16|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_083.wav|103|I don't know why she is not here.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_296.wav|53|The strong performance is expected to continue.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_112.wav|64|It is a serious offence of reckless conduct.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_064.wav|39|I am pleased to be in them.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_375.wav|60|The whole family was in shock.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_138.wav|87|Absences should be carefully monitored.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_150.wav|40|We have the location, which is assured.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_139.wav|62|It's the same with us.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_299.wav|42|It has not yet opened to pupils.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_068.wav|20|I was as strong as a horse.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_012.wav|44|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_141.wav|32|But she was very human.)
DUMMY2/p364/p364_102.wav|88|This takes the pressure off.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_203.wav|98|The professor said the results were positive.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_443.wav|39|No decisions have been made in this respect.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_004.wav|53|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_375.wav|38|This is a huge boost for my confidence.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_171.wav|5|It is not either national standards or local control.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_144.wav|40|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_204.wav|58|I never made any offer to Mark.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_346.wav|6|You did not see it.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_030.wav|29|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_068.wav|17|This is about the Orange Order.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_246.wav|102|Around the building, the atmosphere is brittle and hung over.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_114.wav|95|Their attitude is all wrong.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_092.wav|71|"They are now divorced."
DUMMY2/p345/p345_007.wav|82|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_126.wav|8|But we could only help a handful of people.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_383.wav|100|They should take their mobile phones.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_073.wav|92|Where does he go from here?
DUMMY2/p364/p364_199.wav|88|On recent evidence, he will not be missed.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_059.wav|96|That's the truth.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_039.wav|6|That's probably the hard bit about being dropped.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_313.wav|66|Calderwood would agree with that.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_313.wav|37|Movie stars are public property.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_191.wav|101|People will ask about us.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_307.wav|50|You are a different people.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_113.wav|87|England were ahead until two minutes into injury time.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_346.wav|22|At this level, you have all to perform well.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_193.wav|107|Scottish fishermen condemned the decision.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_385.wav|77|Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_285.wav|39|Much of the equipment was new.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_001.wav|102|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_180.wav|47|It just came into my head that day.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_454.wav|95|That should be the subject matter of a public debate.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_139.wav|2|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_267.wav|15|Here he is, in effect, appointing himself a judge.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_216.wav|32|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.)
DUMMY2/p243/p243_268.wav|53|Last night Bush carried it rather easily.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_196.wav|84|I had a train to catch.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_318.wav|75|They have to be addressed.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_329.wav|7|I was just so determined.)
DUMMY2/p303/p303_190.wav|44|English rugby is on the brink of extinction, though, it's official.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_238.wav|28|I'm happy with the outcome.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_375.wav|99|The casualties were not named.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_355.wav|33|It's only tackling congestion.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_473.wav|24|Talks between directors have been underway since last month.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_356.wav|66|She had every right to read the warrant.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_385.wav|26|It is a temptation which should be resisted.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_108.wav|31|He was jailed for a year.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_354.wav|62|I feel really sorry for the Iraqi people.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_056.wav|75|You must have a government and a good civil service.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_357.wav|50|Look at the Liberal Democrats.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_013.wav|105|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_312.wav|86|Kids are terrible.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_421.wav|76|It appears to have been closed down.

DUMMY2/p333/p333_075.wav|64|Still, the experience was amazing, she says.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_194.wav|64|There was an element of jealousy.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_149.wav|54|They chose to side with terror.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_263.wav|80|They are never here.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_167.wav|72|Manchester United were still trying up to yesterday.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_173.wav|74|And did they have sex?
DUMMY2/p351/p351_128.wav|33|He has something in common with the Wallabies.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_345.wav|103|Brian Wilson, in case you didn't know, is a genius.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_253.wav|56|It makes no difference to their friendship.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_372.wav|86|By that time, however, it was already too late.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_115.wav|73|The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_165.wav|103|That's the way it is.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_287.wav|60|We know the fight is going to happen.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_273.wav|66|Having guidelines in advance is helpful.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_219.wav|105|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_020.wav|5|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_005.wav|0|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_194.wav|38|This is a step backwards.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_226.wav|60|His leader wanted to celebrate.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_194.wav|16|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_216.wav|63|This will be our new beginning.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_005.wav|81|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_398.wav|24|He has earned the right to their respect.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_210.wav|91|They always want to give a performance.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_201.wav|66|It's fun and challenging, but it is not easy.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_007.wav|33|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_190.wav|49|Broomfield was the centre of the town.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_186.wav|43|It just came into my head that day.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_100.wav|15|There's a strong involvement.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_268.wav|31|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_151.wav|61|The idea is simple.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_278.wav|95|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_253.wav|75|Pensions are a long-term investment.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_227.wav|56|It had so much to do with the output.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_089.wav|96|Now the system is right behind us.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_229.wav|50|So far, the problems have occurred in the US.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_458.wav|75|And it covers the spectrum.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_304.wav|89|My whole life has changed.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_082.wav|39|Two Israeli cabinet ministers were in the building at the time.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_199.wav|90|People acted too quickly.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_289.wav|96|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_057.wav|91|I keep my fingers crossed.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_122.wav|102|I will speak to Michael about this.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_363.wav|27|There was a substantial explosion.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_428.wav|105|It had been in place since last July.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_273.wav|1|However, many of their victories have been close affairs.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_345.wav|102|So we shall remain vigilant, and keep the pressure on him.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_232.wav|64|It is time for a more honest approach.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_003.wav|62|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_016.wav|37|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_064.wav|60|Most of the works are small in scale.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_146.wav|40|No-one in Downing Street can speak the language of the unions.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_028.wav|81|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_188.wav|54|It wasn't a flashy performance, it was very workmanlike.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_071.wav|90|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_080.wav|93|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_433.wav|89|We were used.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_301.wav|16|Nothing is safe.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_182.wav|83|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_345.wav|60|How did it all come about?
DUMMY2/p364/p364_161.wav|88|It is not illegal.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_013.wav|76|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_246.wav|63|This would include the GM food industry.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_361.wav|11|I hope that is the lucky break.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_262.wav|91|Scotland has been caught in the crossfire.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_119.wav|10|Ferguson will be a millionaire.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_258.wav|29|Nato was not a love affair.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_175.wav|58|Promises were not kept.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_235.wav|14|Truth is the child of time.)
DUMMY2/p336/p336_063.wav|98|Someone else has now got them.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_148.wav|76|A review of the decision is being sought.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_152.wav|102|We came across the first set of bodies.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_297.wav|89|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_180.wav|84|We've made a couple of albums.

DUMMY2/p256/p256_285.wav|90|It's like a high school play.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_144.wav|101|She will do for me.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_158.wav|28|It's not just a male agenda.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_038.wav|12|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_350.wav|27|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_256.wav|55|It is very much in the eye of the individual.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_199.wav|97|That's how she wants to remember him.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_041.wav|78|In London today, it was business as usual.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_142.wav|48|Absences should be carefully monitored.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_339.wav|32|There is a handful of rewarding paintings.)
DUMMY2/p314/p314_107.wav|51|You can expect a hell of a fuss.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_115.wav|45|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_271.wav|10|was everything done to save people ?
DUMMY2/p317/p317_406.wav|97|They will have to cut through the roof.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_185.wav|98|They are now out in the cold.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_394.wav|47|This is a major step forward for carers.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_157.wav|106|We made a world record together.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_178.wav|27|He was a crazy man.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_312.wav|17|Both agreed on the success of the event.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_313.wav|90|This wasn't the way it was supposed to be.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_225.wav|46|But Annika is just amazing.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_240.wav|80|It's a lovely, lovely film.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_062.wav|89|There was no safety net.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_154.wav|85|You look at that.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_237.wav|68|But one shouldn't go by that.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_126.wav|47|You've got to be vigilant.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_093.wav|42|I sincerely hope not.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_069.wav|1|This is a most serious matter.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_326.wav|22|It needs to be sorted out by Easter.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_101.wav|54|The party lasted all night.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_230.wav|83|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_366.wav|43|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_030.wav|7|I could not do it.)
DUMMY2/p232/p232_021.wav|96|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_018.wav|36|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_018.wav|38|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_281.wav|104|I've never seen them down here.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_309.wav|101|Are they free ?
DUMMY2/p293/p293_321.wav|23|The ministers are now to make their decision.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_439.wav|106|Today has been a good day for Northern Ireland.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_025.wav|90|It's a relief that a decision has finally been made.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_062.wav|104|Debate is not just talk.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_214.wav|100|They are looking at a flotation.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_317.wav|106|Aberdeen had little to offer.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_387.wav|20|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_295.wav|7|They must play for each other.)
DUMMY2/p341/p341_202.wav|66|NOW it is official, Barry Ferguson is staying with Rangers.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_140.wav|62|It's an awful lot of money.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_244.wav|16|It was a hit.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_279.wav|8|There's not much money in cycling.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_009.wav|107|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_038.wav|1|It is my nature.

DUMMY2/p343/p343_245.wav|21|They have not been named.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_127.wav|9|Some of the characters will not be played by humans.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_060.wav|47|Lancashire Police said they were not treating the death as suspicious.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_276.wav|80|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_025.wav|43|He has not been named.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_217.wav|97|We are in the hat.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_456.wav|63|They were good years for him.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_038.wav|91|That respect is missing in the Netherlands.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_049.wav|75|This is the interesting part.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_277.wav|45|His place in central defence was taken by John Anderson.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_202.wav|16|I am delighted for Simon.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_322.wav|45|It should be equal.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_116.wav|6|But that is not enough.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_104.wav|68|It's such a beautiful place, like a palace in Italy.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_094.wav|16|It is annoying.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_291.wav|55|I'm interested in interesting work.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_227.wav|15|No wonder he missed the conversion.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_088.wav|82|He was pronounced dead in hospital.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_145.wav|71|"It is like a football team."
DUMMY2/p280/p280_376.wav|52|It used to be all hard sell.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_274.wav|17|It seems to have worked.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_211.wav|39|We must keep our feet on the ground.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_339.wav|17|You need a reason for staying.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_251.wav|88|It was really surprising.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_049.wav|30|Happily we found it in the library.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_109.wav|55|We want the results as soon as possible before Thursday.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_138.wav|2|Who would be right?
DUMMY2/p233/p233_275.wav|84|It was an easy decision to come here.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_109.wav|8|I would be prepared to go anywhere.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_263.wav|46|In that case, we would be prepared to defend ourselves.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_045.wav|33|You had to go and see him.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_359.wav|39|There is a good example in this city.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_082.wav|73|It is a lifeline.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_093.wav|25|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_300.wav|13|The atmosphere was excellent.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_041.wav|56|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_198.wav|87|They have inherited the human rights abusers.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_176.wav|87|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_332.wav|38|Are you from the rugby?
DUMMY2/p280/p280_330.wav|52|If I didn't go for the world record, I'd feel guilty.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_424.wav|22|Nobody else was with me.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_166.wav|41|Tell it like it was?
DUMMY2/p335/p335_161.wav|49|It's been a good year.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_355.wav|35|We are encouraged by the news.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_221.wav|82|It's the right thing.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_409.wav|92|It is a very disturbing picture for men.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_020.wav|18|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_389.wav|84|What happened in the summer ?
DUMMY2/p255/p255_324.wav|31|They will be destroyed.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_198.wav|22|Her condition last night was described as critical.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_002.wav|45|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_027.wav|71|"He said the matter had been neglected in the past."
DUMMY2/p302/p302_211.wav|30|This is a one-year deal, but who knows?
DUMMY2/p233/p233_366.wav|84|They play together perfectly.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_011.wav|54|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_006.wav|95|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_252.wav|59|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_063.wav|91|Staff were invited to make their own proposals.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_305.wav|20|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_204.wav|97|McMaster is keen to draw attention to others.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_389.wav|1|If only we had known.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_110.wav|37|This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_142.wav|24|That is far too high.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_166.wav|21|His is a success story by any standard.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_283.wav|98|Awareness in Europe of Scotland is high.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_205.wav|50|Who was she ?
DUMMY2/p226/p226_077.wav|43|Tommy is not a problem.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_281.wav|67|People have no choice.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_205.wav|76|So she told him.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_301.wav|25|One was a lawyer.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_196.wav|35|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_035.wav|70|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_424.wav|77|Both promotions come as no surprise.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_312.wav|104|However, it seems that he got it wrong.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_280.wav|39|They must play for each other.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_367.wav|69|It was a funny game.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_226.wav|36|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_041.wav|74|We didn't deserve to win.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_222.wav|81|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_003.wav|18|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a sack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_320.wav|15|He's a good player, but he's not the only one.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_176.wav|95|He was asked to quit.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_105.wav|76|The quality of work is very impressive.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_391.wav|29|They will fight for everything.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_296.wav|28|Inclusion and Autism, Is It Working?
DUMMY2/p239/p239_133.wav|48|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
DUMMY2/p225/p225_176.wav|101|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_147.wav|73|Well, he should know.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_136.wav|57|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_267.wav|36|There will be widespread support on all sides.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_224.wav|19|There is no margin for error.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_129.wav|20|We had a great time when we came with Easy Rider.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_115.wav|12|There is no point in pushing it.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_126.wav|50|It is too pretty, it is too small.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_004.wav|21|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_340.wav|9|The police have to act to help them.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_138.wav|49|This is not presently the case.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_064.wav|59|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_163.wav|67|It was by the numbers.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_279.wav|10|I'd never run for them.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_224.wav|72|He was correct in everything he did.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_082.wav|44|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_024.wav|44|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_114.wav|67|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_019.wav|58|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_088.wav|93|Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_028.wav|28|It is believed he had been stabbed.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_291.wav|1|It's now down in black and white.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_091.wav|4|Some things in life you have to accept.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_112.wav|107|She will also get a pay rise.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_270.wav|88|For many, it had become a fact of life.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_074.wav|61|Painful, but only because it's true.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_087.wav|79|This is a personal decision for me.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_368.wav|17|But does the same thing happen with music?
DUMMY2/p306/p306_163.wav|12|I took a minibus into town.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_315.wav|91|We are ready for the long haul.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_137.wav|37|I won't make an official complaint.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_103.wav|70|Two of the team became ill.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_098.wav|5|Meanwhile, the Scottish Consumer Council yesterday offered support for the new Bill.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_046.wav|55|They seem too much of a sure thing.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_124.wav|2|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_331.wav|102|However, within five minutes they were able to celebrate.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_143.wav|102|He's been the key to everything.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_264.wav|50|What was the matter for concern ?
DUMMY2/p276/p276_047.wav|106|Mr Darling yesterday dismissed the criticism.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_279.wav|59|It's very safe.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_151.wav|21|He pleaded for caution.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_015.wav|4|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_082.wav|24|I've had it for the exams.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_374.wav|11|This is the goal.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_365.wav|34|Shyness has rarely sold in boxing terms.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_048.wav|71|"The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids."
DUMMY2/p345/p345_324.wav|82|But could it afford to run it?
DUMMY2/p330/p330_262.wav|1|I played really well on the back nine.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_153.wav|63|At last, in the third year, a letter has arrived.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_436.wav|89|They were not even allowed to see them.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_046.wav|99|No meaningful response was issued.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_089.wav|65|The savings can be dramatic.)
DUMMY2/p345/p345_273.wav|82|The distinction is also supported by doctors.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_324.wav|84|I saw some good things.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_137.wav|33|A career as a doctor is on hold.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_306.wav|68|Some have other commitments.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_392.wav|45|But, in fact, the reverse is true.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_137.wav|39|It is just a tax on employment.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_310.wav|21|Last night, the company could not be contacted.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_142.wav|39|Does the name matter ?
DUMMY2/p270/p270_231.wav|8|Yet the evidence is plain to see.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_206.wav|41|It is a small part, and it's very small in the book.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_077.wav|83|It is a job creation scheme.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_149.wav|36|It is not normal practice.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_323.wav|64|I'm quite embarrassed and ashamed of doing that.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_099.wav|49|That is nearly four people every day.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_033.wav|58|I am proud of moments like that.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_307.wav|78|It all started with a visiting rugby club.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_146.wav|86|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_154.wav|81|My Dad is a hero.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_224.wav|14|It was finally agreed on Saturday.)
DUMMY2/p314/p314_024.wav|51|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_278.wav|18|It does nothing for me.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_125.wav|76|I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_080.wav|78|How are you, sir ?
DUMMY2/p232/p232_087.wav|96|No progress has been made.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_355.wav|64|We have obviously got some work to do.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_286.wav|39|You get a lot for your money.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_288.wav|59|The goals will come.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_234.wav|12|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_316.wav|96|It should be equal.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_253.wav|24|There is no timetable for completing such inquiries.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_383.wav|70|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_267.wav|31|An appeal against the sentence was dismissed the following year.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_357.wav|85|Do you know who we are?
DUMMY2/p271/p271_267.wav|27|We shall rely on human beings.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_254.wav|60|It seems a shame to leave it.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_206.wav|53|He is particularly happy with the size of the gallery.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_079.wav|32|It is the only company of its kind in the UK.)
DUMMY2/p295/p295_063.wav|92|They have a car and cannot afford another.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_190.wav|16|Is that success?
DUMMY2/p248/p248_357.wav|99|Who was the mystery MP?
DUMMY2/p307/p307_046.wav|22|She added, It is the same story in both countries.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_364.wav|42|I was never alone with her, right?
DUMMY2/p280/p280_220.wav|52|I was independent but I am not now.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_174.wav|75|Are they free ?
DUMMY2/p273/p273_318.wav|56|Leading share prices have also fallen in Paris and Frankfurt.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_051.wav|35|I have made that offer.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_272.wav|82|This action could have been avoided.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_360.wav|16|She is free.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_454.wav|65|He was then replaced by Ross.)
DUMMY2/p230/p230_074.wav|35|However, he stressed that no decision had yet been made.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_104.wav|6|It's somewhere in between.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_160.wav|48|Nato has left them with no other option.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_060.wav|94|They're appalled by that.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_169.wav|60|It is about the script for me.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_203.wav|35|The sanctions are about collective punishment.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_226.wav|89|There is no excuse.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_118.wav|50|Then again, we could have.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_271.wav|52|That's been the difference between the sides.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_352.wav|59|The parents are not alone in their concerns about the proposals.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_194.wav|41|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_072.wav|4|But the cost to his health was enormous.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_308.wav|38|They must be kept on the ground.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_268.wav|50|I've had the time of my life.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_053.wav|40|It is unique.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_125.wav|54|Everyone needs a holiday, even the Salvation Army.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_319.wav|21|It is not easy to live in Russia.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_139.wav|42|It's not a great art.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_201.wav|10|I wanted to put myself on the line.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_079.wav|49|It plans to return to this field.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_087.wav|55|Scotland has great assets.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_025.wav|9|Johnson was pretty low.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_027.wav|74|We've just decided to do something about it.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_098.wav|75|We created so many chances.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_153.wav|30|I'm afraid to say anything.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_404.wav|105|It is simple, but profound.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_213.wav|75|The service from the other players was super.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_375.wav|6|Just look at his record.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_171.wav|71|"Waiting times for these services are too long."
DUMMY2/p249/p249_302.wav|80|They are wrong.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_383.wav|97|Surely, if anything, it would be the other way round.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_357.wav|24|Finally came the moment of truth.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_128.wav|57|It is a delight on every level.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_377.wav|69|I didn't know that I had a court appearance on Wednesday.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_346.wav|24|He has made his base in Spain.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_324.wav|78|However, the devil is in the detail.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_107.wav|90|But it was a pleasure.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_337.wav|95|The songs are just so good.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_148.wav|43|Three penalties were given.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_106.wav|58|That was the light relief.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_100.wav|27|They are now divorced.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_238.wav|96|And thought we would get away with it.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_233.wav|38|The hearing in Edinburgh continues.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_246.wav|68|There are just two tournaments remaining.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_285.wav|94|It happens from time to time.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_368.wav|15|You can't really compare.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_177.wav|82|That will be the case.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_100.wav|24|And does it ?
DUMMY2/p240/p240_008.wav|93|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_072.wav|23|You see, my back has gone.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_316.wav|7|The record companies have gone through the floor.)
DUMMY2/p229/p229_307.wav|67|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_121.wav|37|What are they for ?
DUMMY2/p334/p334_261.wav|38|He was sentenced to seven years.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_328.wav|68|Who is going to be penalised?
DUMMY2/p257/p257_098.wav|105|They are now divorced.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_276.wav|34|Scotland had great assets.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_313.wav|40|The Premier League has been a huge success.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_293.wav|76|This year, it was a little different.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_490.wav|65|We've got good options.)
DUMMY2/p254/p254_278.wav|41|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_072.wav|70|Robin Williams is very subdued.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_075.wav|98|But we will learn from that.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_264.wav|58|So there's a double whammy.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_169.wav|48|Having guidelines in advance is helpful.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_087.wav|61|Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_141.wav|38|And that's good news for the magpies.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_363.wav|56|They should take their mobile phones.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_125.wav|80|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_223.wav|13|I'm pleased with some aspects of the performance.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_200.wav|1|This is a good result for them.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_008.wav|107|They take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_301.wav|7|This could put pressure on UK inflation.)
DUMMY2/p270/p270_313.wav|8|I was brought up in a mining background.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_086.wav|57|Nothing is yet confirmed.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_088.wav|71|"Then came the crunch."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_016.wav|33|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_131.wav|32|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.)
DUMMY2/p269/p269_166.wav|94|I've put my own money into this project.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_341.wav|42|I'm wondering what you feel about the youngest.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_052.wav|41|That should do it.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_213.wav|67|He has a lot of experience as captain in his career.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_111.wav|77|And does it ?
DUMMY2/p336/p336_319.wav|98|This is a problem we have to tackle.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_271.wav|54|Whoever said that cannot have seen it.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_228.wav|23|These will be finally corrected by next week.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_387.wav|96|It was as if it was all happening at a garden party.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_102.wav|11|Two and a half million people have died.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_256.wav|45|At the end of the day, one has to be careful.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_040.wav|85|He is looking for a sporting challenge.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_308.wav|84|I was in daily contact.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_214.wav|83|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_218.wav|48|IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_392.wav|37|Those overseas offices were great.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_273.wav|85|I began to pray.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_108.wav|48|He was a lovely man.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_122.wav|26|It has removed a bit of guilt.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_281.wav|103|I have beaten her a few times.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_308.wav|95|The target is to break even by Christmas.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_055.wav|54|The study, carried out by the consumer magazine Which?
DUMMY2/p251/p251_183.wav|9|We did everything by the book.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_357.wav|16|I first met him last summer.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_011.wav|77|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_128.wav|68|A lot of people were in tears.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_275.wav|80|People have no choice.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_008.wav|95|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_346.wav|2|I HAVE a dream.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_100.wav|97|But don't worry just yet.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_003.wav|69|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_048.wav|42|What do we do for an encore?
DUMMY2/p313/p313_235.wav|76|My body is exhausted.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_293.wav|30|I shall be voting Yes to support him.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_191.wav|5|Is that success?
DUMMY2/p297/p297_105.wav|42|Sub Not Used, McArthur.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_391.wav|58|Everything is surrounded by confusion.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_443.wav|32|Last week against Nelson, we allowed them several opportunities.)
DUMMY2/p316/p316_142.wav|85|However, it was a different story in the final.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_244.wav|83|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_328.wav|80|My view has now completely changed.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_125.wav|2|No production was achieved.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_188.wav|36|The new scheme will have its own terms and conditions.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_061.wav|52|Talks have continued at many different levels.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_208.wav|74|We lost out a little bit.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_081.wav|22|He came in an army uniform.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_423.wav|24|Russell is delighted with them.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_478.wav|75|These people attack the core of my beliefs.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_349.wav|17|He showed he has some things to learn.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_467.wav|100|Phil Mickelson did that last year.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_123.wav|87|Others may have, but I'm a fighter.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_309.wav|59|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_187.wav|67|The home was now under new management.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_326.wav|92|It was hugely popular decision.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_345.wav|64|He's got a great chance of making it.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_016.wav|88|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_380.wav|7|He can handle it without any problem.)
DUMMY2/p339/p339_307.wav|18|They need to look after themselves.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_285.wav|11|Later we discovered it was a hoax.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_070.wav|56|Even the one she loved.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_184.wav|79|There was nothing she could do.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_126.wav|12|There is a lack of chemistry.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_449.wav|89|When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_052.wav|91|She is now planning a visit.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_302.wav|1|Chris is big and jolly.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_164.wav|21|Staff have been informed.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_069.wav|88|It lasted longer than we thought.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_217.wav|87|However, this concern appears to be misguided.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_352.wav|28|I think, at last, the company will find itself again.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_254.wav|81|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_290.wav|44|If Glasgow is so interested, they have the right to bid.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_193.wav|64|The boat was fully equipped with safety equipment.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_032.wav|38|It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_234.wav|10|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_105.wav|13|What did we learn?
DUMMY2/p231/p231_451.wav|50|We went straight into the bedroom.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_293.wav|101|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_195.wav|15|I never had any real direction at school.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_274.wav|10|Is it in the right place ?
DUMMY2/p263/p263_003.wav|39|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_394.wav|1|They will now get that support.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_425.wav|8|It was a breathtaking moment.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_349.wav|102|She has seen, or heard, it all.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_170.wav|21|Do they have to create seven majors?
DUMMY2/p241/p241_034.wav|86|And we have a singer.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_090.wav|5|This one did.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_266.wav|103|I hope he stays.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_149.wav|44|I expected these kind of questions.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_172.wav|17|His track record is not promising.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_253.wav|10|It might be sad, but it's a fact.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_360.wav|25|He put some colour into Scottish history.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_278.wav|88|Visiting fans were banned from attending the game.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_353.wav|67|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_058.wav|33|The jury is still out.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_239.wav|20|You can feel at home in China.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_419.wav|79|Everyone in Britain is proud of this team.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_168.wav|103|I am not a magician.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_138.wav|106|The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_317.wav|16|The Premier League has been a huge success.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_258.wav|26|Chelsea was a great club.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_319.wav|51|Lucky for us, he enjoyed the experience.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_180.wav|10|You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_143.wav|18|Rangers must be winners, it says.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_270.wav|65|I knew him well.)
DUMMY2/p345/p345_006.wav|82|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_229.wav|81|There is no excuse.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_208.wav|68|I don't honestly know how to describe it.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_005.wav|46|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_139.wav|23|The house was so well alight.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_287.wav|34|Tony Blair should get out more.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_045.wav|98|That, though, was just the start of it.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_049.wav|65|I only signed this morning.)
DUMMY2/p250/p250_421.wav|24|I wouldn't want to miss that chance.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_193.wav|31|Four policemen were wounded.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_259.wav|82|The observer saw no evidence of fighting.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_121.wav|94|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_325.wav|58|I'm not interested in coming up with answers.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_200.wav|80|Last night was a key episode.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_078.wav|67|Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_141.wav|15|That is my dream.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_374.wav|22|Scottish life can be like this, too.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_220.wav|88|That suggests that out fitness is good.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_083.wav|89|It is a job creation scheme.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_137.wav|56|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_140.wav|89|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_048.wav|31|I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_182.wav|6|Now is the time for action.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_157.wav|53|When it happened, he could hardly believe it.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_296.wav|1|For now, we must take one game at a time.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_149.wav|90|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_369.wav|96|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_013.wav|104|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_028.wav|50|There was a rush of water.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_093.wav|8|The move follows a review of the Singapore
DUMMY2/p278/p278_113.wav|10|Football is a passion for many.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_374.wav|2|I'm still an amateur in that sense.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_054.wav|43|I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_096.wav|22|We did not even get a free kick.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_217.wav|44|They had given up on him.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_244.wav|50|He is due in Israel tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_182.wav|14|His team management was protective.)
DUMMY2/p251/p251_042.wav|9|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_367.wav|53|The dead woman and the injured man have not yet been named.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_203.wav|51|We just want to get stuck in now.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_061.wav|81|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_344.wav|95|Cast Away now on general release.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_033.wav|74|We don't find any danger from them.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_087.wav|64|The Hague is too good for him.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_015.wav|47|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_384.wav|50|Does it matter ?
DUMMY2/p314/p314_419.wav|51|THE pain was almost too much to bear.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_341.wav|94|It is a strong case.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_202.wav|93|Who will pay for this?
DUMMY2/p262/p262_374.wav|45|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_296.wav|61|I intended to look for another club on loan.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_274.wav|39|I can't get a job.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_290.wav|82|It starts to get you down.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_149.wav|67|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_020.wav|49|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_084.wav|55|He has a real potential.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_294.wav|28|So what is it with Nato?
DUMMY2/p304/p304_215.wav|72|Pupils will be the losers.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_236.wav|49|I don't have any answer for them.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_365.wav|68|That kind of growth is the important thing.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_315.wav|4|Nobody should believe this story.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_299.wav|10|You have to expect this type of thing.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_101.wav|75|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_108.wav|54|She is a double victim.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_345.wav|14|Is there a waiting list ?)
DUMMY2/p287/p287_144.wav|77|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_266.wav|32|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.)
DUMMY2/p301/p301_409.wav|91|Princess Margaret is being buried on that day.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_075.wav|1|This is purely financial.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_179.wav|52|Nato has left them with no other option.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_011.wav|103|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_122.wav|80|Does this mean.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_046.wav|40|Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_222.wav|11|All of the names are familiar to me.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_048.wav|58|It's to do with play.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_021.wav|90|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_067.wav|82|Who would have known.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_337.wav|21|That fight begins today for the freedom and liberty.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_226.wav|91|If not, a deal could take many months.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_267.wav|68|I feel very strongly about that.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_117.wav|50|It is much as it has been described.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_402.wav|13|We all thought we were going to die.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_138.wav|41|Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_190.wav|35|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_390.wav|33|But it didn't happen.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_059.wav|107|Within six minutes, they were two goals down.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_409.wav|106|Many farmers cannot even agree within their own families.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_119.wav|44|Council officials are involved, along with the transport industry.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_048.wav|6|He will never be forgotten.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_433.wav|24|First Minister Donald Dewar will respond.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_146.wav|102|They said to me, Why don't you get into acting, Tommy?
DUMMY2/p299/p299_378.wav|58|He has never even been to Ireland.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_269.wav|23|It's part of your life.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_050.wav|83|A neighbour said.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_437.wav|48|Things are going to change over the next six months.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_056.wav|101|Clearly, it can go either way.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_276.wav|33|We have been very patient.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_355.wav|45|A man has since been charged with his murder.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_252.wav|70|they fail to engage.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_250.wav|88|We just need the Government to act.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_078.wav|85|Robin Williams is subdued.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_046.wav|66|Moray Council could not be contacted last night.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_118.wav|35|It is too pretty, it is too small.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_192.wav|60|But there was no going back.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_278.wav|64|You were the kidnappers.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_310.wav|29|We are not increasing the number.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_367.wav|79|By hard work, is the answer.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_467.wav|48|Dunfermline manager Jimmy Calderwood was candid.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_093.wav|86|A council spokesman said that they could not comment on the issue.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_159.wav|58|In some cases, the nation should be grateful.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_231.wav|52|I felt we played some excellent football in the first half.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_400.wav|55|We will miss him against Celtic.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_363.wav|89|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_383.wav|48|North African countries are also seen as potential customers.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_039.wav|88|I was not fit enough and it showed.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_303.wav|46|A review of the decision is being sought.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_158.wav|86|But we have not heard a thing from Diego.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_199.wav|47|But she might be.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_222.wav|4|The professor said the results were positive.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_105.wav|99|That all hope is never lost.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_118.wav|15|You see, my back has gone.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_288.wav|37|Says the Duke of York.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_027.wav|8|Smoking is also very important.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_269.wav|77|The morale of the Yugoslav army is beginning to crack.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_101.wav|68|The election is total confusion and chaos.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_325.wav|66|That did not go down well.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_374.wav|36|It would be quite nice.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_037.wav|41|They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_101.wav|103|Drugs and housebreaking are linked.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_220.wav|76|Some of the players have not progressed.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_258.wav|56|It was a minor incident.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_176.wav|38|But we have come under attack.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_286.wav|84|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_390.wav|53|His record on Government has always been highly effective.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_162.wav|30|The red card was okay.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_161.wav|97|They make a selective perception process.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_184.wav|95|I am a good player.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_248.wav|86|He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_218.wav|69|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_083.wav|105|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_413.wav|20|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_307.wav|7|We have a high quality product.)
DUMMY2/p361/p361_338.wav|79|It is their day.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_367.wav|64|There was a great support all round the route.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_057.wav|96|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_295.wav|99|Davis is very supportive, as a director.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_098.wav|79|What kind of person is he?
DUMMY2/p239/p239_387.wav|48|She asked for the appointment with me.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_237.wav|25|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_348.wav|76|On reflection, it was really quite exciting.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_211.wav|18|It's a big challenge for the audience.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_070.wav|39|I was very pleased with them today, though.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_100.wav|100|It is a good lifestyle.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_387.wav|37|Pensions are a long-term investment.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_197.wav|58|The rear of the plane was on fire.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_349.wav|86|A report is the first step in a criminal case in India.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_399.wav|75|Do I have a favourite ?
DUMMY2/p281/p281_050.wav|36|I had come back from London.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_002.wav|22|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_057.wav|38|It could take three days.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_390.wav|100|The result is called a patent.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_289.wav|44|Mr Blair was in Washington a week later.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_106.wav|95|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
DUMMY2/p244/p244_142.wav|78|That was the first step.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_127.wav|73|I was dead.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_088.wav|99|Global Scotland will be held at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_317.wav|43|It's about my time as a guitarist.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_341.wav|46|I always said No.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_356.wav|92|So what could be better than becoming captain?
DUMMY2/p233/p233_363.wav|84|Safety was also an issue.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_283.wav|73|So I did.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_043.wav|48|This matter has still to come before the European Parliament.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_420.wav|98|What is going on?
DUMMY2/p258/p258_140.wav|26|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_277.wav|100|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_101.wav|22|But his attendance is not guaranteed.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_437.wav|8|Their condition is described as satisfactory.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_183.wav|18|Did they give any good advice?
DUMMY2/p362/p362_091.wav|15|It's not my fault.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_286.wav|9|He has not created a Festival resource.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_324.wav|54|Scottish public finances emerge from this review enhanced.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_052.wav|37|He is too weak to move.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_340.wav|47|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_087.wav|66|The composer therefore believes he can do it.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_288.wav|17|A formal decision will be announced within months.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_160.wav|49|This is good news for the Western Isles.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_078.wav|42|Football is very easy, you have to work for the team.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_408.wav|48|It seems a waste of talents.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_081.wav|81|He had taken everything from me.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_040.wav|46|I'll have to go out and impress.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_288.wav|95|Paterson can afford to be generous.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_011.wav|68|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_272.wav|19|There was still more disquiet in Israel.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_455.wav|36|She has now been registered as disabled.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_321.wav|57|Robert is a special talent.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_121.wav|29|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
DUMMY2/p284/p284_371.wav|16|They believed it worked.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_280.wav|76|One thing is sure.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_338.wav|61|There was a bit of urgency in the second half.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_186.wav|105|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_027.wav|53|I've got the same feeling as I had last week in Germany.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_248.wav|80|I was shocked.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_059.wav|91|It's the best of both worlds.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_384.wav|95|Does it matter ?
DUMMY2/p284/p284_154.wav|16|My Dad is a hero.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_411.wav|96|You wanted the evidence.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_091.wav|28|At that time, there was no infection within five miles.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_354.wav|83|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_258.wav|51|He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_180.wav|37|Since then, things have improved.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_032.wav|74|But someone has to take them.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_200.wav|47|It's all about money, money, money.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_218.wav|92|She is also claiming constructive and unfair dismissal.
