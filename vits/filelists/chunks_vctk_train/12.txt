DUMMY2/p267/p267_054.wav|0|Four other charges were dropped.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_115.wav|107|The move is considered a major breakthrough.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_232.wav|55|It's used by Ayr Technical College.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_185.wav|100|I had too much to drink.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_463.wav|48|We will provide immediate access.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_203.wav|52|Full details are expected to be released in June.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_341.wav|89|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_005.wav|86|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_074.wav|88|This was a massive result for us.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_269.wav|93|This is a question of Islam.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_023.wav|90|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_385.wav|52|Why do it otherwise ?
DUMMY2/p273/p273_155.wav|56|They could not match it.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_198.wav|29|If the director is with you.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_420.wav|36|I am delighted for them.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_102.wav|98|That is a mark of what you are.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_257.wav|101|My son was too young to die.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_112.wav|80|It is a good lifestyle.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_199.wav|32|He should emerge as the winner.)
DUMMY2/p374/p374_058.wav|11|The net is closing.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_242.wav|32|It will now be revived.)
DUMMY2/p287/p287_349.wav|77|It is a strong case.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_029.wav|25|Is this accurate?
DUMMY2/p250/p250_385.wav|24|We will win the argument.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_132.wav|18|We are still waiting.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_365.wav|26|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_246.wav|42|However we're capable of beating them.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_360.wav|87|I am not ready for Lennox Lewis.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_176.wav|80|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_055.wav|87|I knew my contract was up this year.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_076.wav|4|We don't do this for everyone, of course.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_316.wav|51|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_270.wav|36|That could be in place by next year.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_041.wav|53|Hearts hit back with two goals in four minutes.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_278.wav|65|I'm interested in interesting work.)
DUMMY2/p239/p239_500.wav|48|Iain Duncan Smith is wrong.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_062.wav|57|They're appalled by that.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_255.wav|75|On Wednesday, it is the turn of Cable Wireless.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_301.wav|53|So what is the campaign about ?
DUMMY2/p313/p313_102.wav|76|There was no trouble at all.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_107.wav|34|It's up to their parents to choose.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_059.wav|88|The family is so happy for him.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_084.wav|91|It was published yesterday on the internet.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_131.wav|62|Frustration is not the word.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_121.wav|0|Tiger is not the norm.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_384.wav|25|I can lead by example.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_242.wav|14|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.)
DUMMY2/p312/p312_064.wav|62|I've not said anything to them, they know.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_053.wav|93|Hopefully, it will be built by next year.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_283.wav|65|She now lives in London.)
DUMMY2/p239/p239_211.wav|48|I would be surprised if he decided to give up.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_281.wav|76|It was a foolhardy decision.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_044.wav|81|The shift in public perception about the disease is amazing.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_306.wav|3|They are not going the length of the pitch.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_283.wav|5|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_358.wav|12|You see, my back has gone.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_094.wav|100|All the pressure will be on him.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_042.wav|89|A quality audit officer has also been appointed.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_287.wav|30|I'd love to be like Peter.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_177.wav|63|They could not match it.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_291.wav|36|He was also married with two children.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_268.wav|94|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_358.wav|103|Just don't go looking to be shocked.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_254.wav|92|We're all involved in creating the work.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_501.wav|75|Our idea is to share and lower the cost.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_059.wav|50|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
DUMMY2/p362/p362_307.wav|15|Of course it is.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_288.wav|45|The mood is good.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_040.wav|101|You'd better believe it.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_124.wav|0|It would make a lot of sense.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_364.wav|65|They had to have hospital treatment.)
DUMMY2/p326/p326_092.wav|28|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_264.wav|0|I can't get a job.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_134.wav|21|I haven't been able to do it since.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_002.wav|79|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_115.wav|96|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_099.wav|93|I see no need for change.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_243.wav|46|Glasgow is making inroads in some areas.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_018.wav|2|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_313.wav|6|It will be very damaging for research.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_369.wav|22|Moving from Manchester to London was upheaval enough.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_194.wav|9|Mr Kennedy is not a candidate for the Scottish Parliament.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_053.wav|54|Her mother said she fell off a swing.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_163.wav|44|It's now down in black and white.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_060.wav|56|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_333.wav|50|However, the groups denied the claims.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_062.wav|28|For the other parties, it is back to business as usual.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_248.wav|16|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_249.wav|71|"I am very angry."
DUMMY2/p227/p227_194.wav|29|Trading conditions have not been that bad.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_310.wav|40|The letters are going out today.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_027.wav|49|I believe in the Church.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_018.wav|77|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_332.wav|74|People are using it in their daily lives.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_122.wav|52|England were ahead until two minutes into injury time.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_061.wav|41|This is a club on the rise.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_187.wav|89|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_254.wav|88|We can do it.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_080.wav|47|It's all going to clear the debt.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_337.wav|0|There was no time scale.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_373.wav|11|This is not a struggle against Islam.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_175.wav|55|I made my mind up before we came on tour.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_166.wav|99|It's that sort of night.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_394.wav|34|I want to go home.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_253.wav|101|Clearly, the need for a personal loan is written in the stars.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_156.wav|65|It gives a commitment.)
DUMMY2/p238/p238_157.wav|37|The following are the principal provisions.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_224.wav|30|And we're not there yet.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_417.wav|85|This is your country.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_414.wav|24|The choice is strictly personal.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_253.wav|79|It is not just the agencies.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_046.wav|84|The man became a reporter.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_394.wav|45|His remarks appear to have had an effect.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_031.wav|22|I saw the explosion and panicked.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_385.wav|79|Father is on the train.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_083.wav|19|I've invented a village in East Lothian.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_256.wav|93|He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_157.wav|92|We must get the three points.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_286.wav|53|In fact, I have been a bit of a terrorist to the council.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_092.wav|70|We are on the path of change.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_343.wav|74|Well, there can be no complaints about this one.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_246.wav|88|I believe in having difficult times.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_179.wav|66|And does it?
DUMMY2/p254/p254_316.wav|41|The parents will have a great time, too.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_274.wav|80|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_158.wav|53|They let you see the world through a fresh pair of eyes.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_081.wav|66|Robert is a special talent.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_141.wav|104|He invented the language.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_074.wav|81|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_345.wav|105|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_284.wav|41|You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_123.wav|100|The deal was presented yesterday as a merger.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_105.wav|9|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_256.wav|1|It could have been a hammering by now.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_019.wav|36|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_231.wav|85|Its future is uncertain.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_377.wav|78|However, the appeal judges rejected the argument.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_263.wav|39|A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_403.wav|87|We're looking for unity in the council.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_029.wav|72|I know my job.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_369.wav|85|It left me with sadness.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_341.wav|53|Put another way, they just won't do it.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_328.wav|36|The actor has met with Mandela.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_102.wav|4|Which he is, too.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_141.wav|18|It will be for the committee to decide.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_066.wav|7|Last night, the move was bitterly denounced by France Telecom.)
DUMMY2/p241/p241_207.wav|86|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_105.wav|18|We have been so lucky.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_273.wav|11|We can only do that for so long.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_065.wav|31|The end result is precisely the same.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_080.wav|97|That must be left to the Parole Board.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_174.wav|99|The jury is still out.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_361.wav|91|And that match was played in June.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_373.wav|104|Try to save us.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_169.wav|52|We had to work very hard for our points.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_301.wav|51|Check that he is dead.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_145.wav|52|All eight victims were based in Germany.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_224.wav|27|He seemed to lose his focus.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_071.wav|11|Yesterday, one, from Aberdeen, was postponed.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_124.wav|25|You can spend money on housing.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_266.wav|68|There is no such thing.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_320.wav|62|It is not illegal.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_236.wav|12|The success story shows no signs of stopping.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_373.wav|72|I'm just a piece in the jigsaw.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_148.wav|12|I was in the train station overnight.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_208.wav|19|It was good to score the goal today.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_247.wav|10|It had so much to do with output.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_233.wav|61|I'd never seen a play about me.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_429.wav|36|John Daly has a burning ambition.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_403.wav|106|After the match, do you ?
DUMMY2/p231/p231_432.wav|50|I never had a childhood.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_124.wav|27|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_380.wav|107|She was released from hospital yesterday.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_012.wav|2|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_302.wav|38|I just need a bit of luck.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_262.wav|107|It's not one for the purists.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_134.wav|65|This man could yet win over Scottish hearts.)
DUMMY2/p246/p246_334.wav|5|I've got no secret.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_139.wav|56|It was a terrible combination of factors.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_025.wav|84|We are a service industry.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_147.wav|6|I doubt it would be genuine.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_182.wav|100|I will be in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_077.wav|37|I have made that offer.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_353.wav|28|And that gives a kind of freedom.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_233.wav|22|Its workforce is to be made redundant.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_124.wav|67|I joined a group.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_308.wav|107|The list is too long for this piece.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_066.wav|52|Do not give your details to anyone.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_153.wav|6|It has no chance.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_221.wav|97|Other people also tried.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_030.wav|101|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_398.wav|15|But don't just take my word, for it.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_120.wav|99|They've got to account for it.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_105.wav|81|Oil embargo endorsed.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_319.wav|59|My view has now completely changed.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_292.wav|45|Mr Campbell received a phone call.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_065.wav|10|The judge was really nice.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_286.wav|90|Scotland were beaten again.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_053.wav|59|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_290.wav|105|It just came into my head that day.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_018.wav|82|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_203.wav|17|But first it goes out on TV.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_165.wav|17|Four minutes later, the show was over.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_436.wav|75|It looked like a war zone.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_234.wav|49|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_363.wav|50|We live on an island.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_181.wav|10|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_037.wav|63|Costs have got to be controlled.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_300.wav|47|Nothing is safe.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_013.wav|68|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_245.wav|39|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_169.wav|83|We have a budget in March.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_394.wav|85|There may be hope this year, however.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_317.wav|12|I enjoy playing with both of them.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_063.wav|79|For that much we must be grateful.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_035.wav|37|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_001.wav|92|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_211.wav|31|We will give a formal response to the report in due course.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_344.wav|3|We do not have the papers.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_191.wav|34|However, within those figures, income from overseas visitors increased.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_239.wav|101|In fact, he is not even in the squad for the game.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_067.wav|37|Then they scored two goals to win.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_212.wav|44|Suspension will come into force at midnight.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_415.wav|64|I want to win this thing.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_168.wav|23|So, easy does it.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_120.wav|92|The whole thing in general is moving on.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_258.wav|21|It went on forever.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_078.wav|104|Subs not used, McGraw.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_047.wav|57|We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_211.wav|78|He is believed to live in Britain.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_359.wav|56|Are they free ?
DUMMY2/p294/p294_328.wav|104|There are so many unanswered questions.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_230.wav|7|January is a bad time of year.)
DUMMY2/p303/p303_281.wav|44|What is the Working Families Tax Credit?
DUMMY2/p231/p231_312.wav|50|I thought it was my only chance.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_330.wav|68|The Government, however, insists the company is not for sale.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_377.wav|21|He took away my childhood.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_083.wav|28|There will be tough opponents to this report.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_346.wav|44|I can't blame the fans for getting frustrated.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_297.wav|60|And Michael was just great.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_329.wav|50|The problems began a long time ago.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_387.wav|58|Mary is, as it were, the cause of her mother's death.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_339.wav|79|They are a very good side, without a doubt.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_124.wav|45|Our intentions are real.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_223.wav|66|I've been thinking about it for a year.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_093.wav|74|The teenager had been missing for six months.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_376.wav|13|We were given a break.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_162.wav|27|These days are long gone.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_293.wav|77|The partnership was set up during the summer.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_117.wav|80|It's a long process.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_331.wav|9|They had a confession.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_317.wav|105|I saw some good things.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_160.wav|7|People were actually not on his side.)
DUMMY2/p241/p241_255.wav|86|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_173.wav|92|They are in the euro.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_298.wav|19|We did discuss the Lockerbie issue.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_065.wav|35|Both sides have been hit by injury.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_367.wav|31|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_320.wav|69|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_072.wav|98|Still, some additions are inspired.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_048.wav|17|We're talking about creating an attractive neighbourhood.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_162.wav|24|It is not just about pay.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_187.wav|83|Our team is just so young.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_275.wav|48|It's going to be very closely watched.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_054.wav|14|Italy is a beautiful place.)
DUMMY2/p374/p374_090.wav|11|We have no idea what caused the derailment.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_401.wav|48|Everything has its place and purpose.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_264.wav|46|Players want to know what is on offer.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_248.wav|48|Adams is surely worth a chance.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_211.wav|56|He remains a main board director of Royal.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_274.wav|87|Luckily, our patient was stable.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_305.wav|4|That was me today.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_383.wav|103|He added, however, that all options are under review.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_087.wav|83|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_350.wav|34|However, pensions and salaries have yet to be settled.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_151.wav|58|I love the tradition of vaudeville.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_141.wav|61|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_384.wav|76|We have been preparing all year.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_125.wav|17|Meanwhile, Rangers will continue to search for a striker.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_348.wav|10|It looks as though the issue, with The Scotsman is too sensitive.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_099.wav|31|Two of the team became ill.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_423.wav|18|Couldn't see the point.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_045.wav|76|I never had a childhood.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_029.wav|66|The injuries are not too serious.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_404.wav|78|The service is expected to be introduced in December.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_193.wav|86|Off I went.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_124.wav|44|John Reid, the Scottish secretary, also welcomed the news.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_247.wav|31|It's quite a line-up!
DUMMY2/p262/p262_219.wav|45|We have not given up hope.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_458.wav|8|If that's the case, he will struggle.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_237.wav|61|They are the innocent victims.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_138.wav|64|It is never an easy game.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_069.wav|61|It is like a river running by my home.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_174.wav|77|They bought the property four years ago.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_163.wav|18|I believe the gap is nearly there.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_348.wav|39|Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_189.wav|85|Police are treating the incident as attempted murder.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_157.wav|100|The bank was now involved.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_359.wav|84|He could make it.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_382.wav|2|Yet the data is compelling.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_335.wav|48|From there, they can go anywhere.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_116.wav|30|I can assure you, the new Augusta National is exactly that.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_236.wav|53|That is the last thing they need.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_021.wav|102|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_420.wav|16|He was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_014.wav|36|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_207.wav|41|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_249.wav|12|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_401.wav|75|I didn't know that I had a court appearance on Wednesday.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_172.wav|0|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_439.wav|7|There is a solution, she believes.)
DUMMY2/p262/p262_285.wav|45|He will address the nation this evening.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_046.wav|64|It does make a big difference.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_048.wav|13|We suffered a lot for seven years.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_003.wav|67|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_234.wav|38|He took my breath away.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_252.wav|87|I've come here for the jersey.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_023.wav|69|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_212.wav|56|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_306.wav|88|Sub Not Used, McKee.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_285.wav|59|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_351.wav|33|There was no basis for their arrest.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_127.wav|22|We didn't enjoy the first game, but today they were excellent.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_454.wav|48|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_390.wav|84|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_377.wav|14|Two things were clear from the new programme.)
DUMMY2/p247/p247_149.wav|14|Are you going to win ?)
DUMMY2/p241/p241_278.wav|86|We have to break that cycle.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_138.wav|90|We never said that we would walk through the third division.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_055.wav|17|Alcohol, of course, is strictly forbidden in Iran.

DUMMY2/p285/p285_391.wav|2|They are good.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_054.wav|38|But, by that time, of course, it is again.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_401.wav|37|He left the hospital without receiving any medication.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_008.wav|79|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_099.wav|19|He wouldn't allow that to happen.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_135.wav|11|The contest was already over.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_087.wav|63|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_349.wav|107|The hotel was now for sale.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_067.wav|21|Funding needs to be long term.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_145.wav|76|However, it's not all bad news for women.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_027.wav|83|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_248.wav|28|I enjoy playing with both of them.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_275.wav|101|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_065.wav|101|There is no pressure on us.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_109.wav|13|It's nice to be involved.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_204.wav|96|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_193.wav|14|You know the sort of thing.)
DUMMY2/p362/p362_063.wav|15|Policing the profession is important.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_184.wav|28|I love the Scottish and the Irish people.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_198.wav|79|It was just a feeling.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_063.wav|8|Have a look at our accounts.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_188.wav|1|It's such a beautiful place, like a palace in Italy.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_392.wav|10|I always knew she was funny.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_227.wav|7|The move follows a review of the Singapore)
DUMMY2/p297/p297_099.wav|42|The scheme is hopelessly failing.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_212.wav|49|We are not ruling it out.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_248.wav|84|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_065.wav|20|Painful, but only because it's true.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_341.wav|7|The songs are just so good.)
DUMMY2/p310/p310_187.wav|17|This guy is never going to give up.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_285.wav|40|It was good.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_096.wav|66|The death rates are still as high.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_426.wav|32|Being captain of this club is fantastic.)
DUMMY2/p326/p326_333.wav|28|Many innocent people will die.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_181.wav|65|Neil has worked hard throughout his career.)
DUMMY2/p297/p297_011.wav|42|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say that he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_259.wav|99|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_397.wav|47|Emotions were complex.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_331.wav|60|This plan is all about respect.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_391.wav|14|He will consult the right people.)
DUMMY2/p302/p302_156.wav|30|These men could be anywhere in the world.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_389.wav|10|Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_381.wav|18|He was at the outset of his career.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_145.wav|51|We are trying to clarify the issues.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_191.wav|41|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_029.wav|73|We speak about the performance.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_055.wav|40|There's a danger.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_170.wav|54|I got off to a great start.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_309.wav|66|They were the better side on the day.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_354.wav|101|This action reflects a slump in bookings.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_254.wav|3|From there, they can go anywhere.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_048.wav|54|I've been asked that already, this morning - on the radio.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_250.wav|53|He has many offers from the English Premiership.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_061.wav|86|It was all in a short period of time.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_054.wav|56|The situation is not easy, but we will prevail.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_056.wav|82|We expect them to deliver for us.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_048.wav|69|We will push.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_236.wav|81|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_123.wav|59|Is that it?
DUMMY2/p250/p250_243.wav|24|A career as a doctor is on hold.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_234.wav|72|We were desperate to get the game on.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_046.wav|28|It is a good result for Great Britain.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_316.wav|17|It will be the final push.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_255.wav|44|We have reacted well to each other.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_321.wav|18|I would love to do that.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_278.wav|91|That doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_247.wav|96|She is well balanced.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_348.wav|73|A review is under way.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_201.wav|71|"I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling."
DUMMY2/p295/p295_415.wav|92|Scotland needs to hear it, too.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_078.wav|56|We have to offer value for money.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_006.wav|31|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_093.wav|0|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_269.wav|9|Kirkwood was arrested.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_126.wav|59|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_332.wav|63|The party lasted all night.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_048.wav|52|After the match, do you ?
DUMMY2/p265/p265_286.wav|73|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_125.wav|13|Britain has never had it so good.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_341.wav|72|There were many positives for this club.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_299.wav|85|I am quite excited about it.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_076.wav|94|It is a job creation scheme.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_406.wav|89|They recorded their debut album in New York.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_155.wav|46|I certainly believe we can do it.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_275.wav|77|Do I think about them often ?
DUMMY2/p311/p311_050.wav|4|They are already on the way there.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_333.wav|47|Donald was his friend.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_106.wav|33|We have no excuses.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_229.wav|32|The output price index in December was unchanged on November.)
DUMMY2/p249/p249_155.wav|80|The weaknesses are few.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_455.wav|24|It is a tough game but we have a chance.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_038.wav|66|There is no escape.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_156.wav|60|No, we were not exactly favourites.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_090.wav|23|Will he be given time?
DUMMY2/p232/p232_259.wav|96|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_396.wav|75|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
DUMMY2/p364/p364_027.wav|88|That would be a big step forward.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_078.wav|19|We are confident of taking that back.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_274.wav|24|Messages have to be reinforced.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_227.wav|49|This is wonderful news.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_052.wav|36|The cuts were made within an hour of each other.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_180.wav|34|They were later released, and last night were staying with relatives.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_044.wav|105|I hate the word.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_080.wav|92|People are already enjoying it.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_130.wav|100|He is a great addition to our team.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_118.wav|39|It was won on the issue of the land.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_157.wav|81|He can do no wrong.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_047.wav|62|I feel pretty good.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_400.wav|78|It is the last meeting of the season.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_299.wav|63|That has been described in some quarters as nonsense and arrogance.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_333.wav|40|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_197.wav|10|However, this idea is never developed.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_034.wav|89|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_247.wav|71|"Chelsea was a great club."
DUMMY2/p360/p360_126.wav|60|Or was it?
DUMMY2/p298/p298_331.wav|68|Just see where the blood is coming from.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_324.wav|32|So what happens next ?)
DUMMY2/p341/p341_285.wav|66|If they don't, they won't get what they want.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_167.wav|83|Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_208.wav|6|That decision is now being appealed.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_125.wav|78|We had a great time.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_051.wav|105|I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_260.wav|93|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_243.wav|6|It is also claimed that he was murdered.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_171.wav|37|I've no idea how it works.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_141.wav|19|That sort of thing is long gone.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_103.wav|101|Everyone deserves to share in this success.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_418.wav|40|We have to expand.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_289.wav|26|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_326.wav|68|What is the truth about the cow?
DUMMY2/p303/p303_104.wav|44|It's such a beautiful place, like a palace in Italy.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_164.wav|81|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_260.wav|28|I never had any confidence in it afterwards.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_132.wav|7|I am totally devoted to this job.)
DUMMY2/p312/p312_012.wav|62|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_059.wav|73|Robin Williams is very subdued.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_400.wav|38|The track is currently covered in snow.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_376.wav|7|Neither man has been charged.)
DUMMY2/p310/p310_376.wav|17|So what does one do?
DUMMY2/p239/p239_034.wav|48|Drink and petrol prices remain untouched.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_299.wav|100|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_357.wav|15|The programme was awful.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_126.wav|40|She really suffered for her art.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_191.wav|23|So he was anxious to try something new.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_082.wav|1|I am here to play football.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_080.wav|87|Autumn is the time of fulfilment.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_201.wav|83|It's all about money, money, money.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_103.wav|32|I'm delighted for everyone at Stirling.)
DUMMY2/p336/p336_153.wav|98|It's like an extension of your body.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_073.wav|90|It should be devolved.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_365.wav|103|We have been preparing all year.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_100.wav|67|They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_060.wav|31|Hopefully, we have learned a lot from that game.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_169.wav|77|His son is a local legend.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_222.wav|89|However, no further action was taken by police.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_204.wav|102|Donald was a man with many friends.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_135.wav|66|Yet he chose to do something different.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_310.wav|74|The difference was amazing.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_143.wav|36|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_435.wav|37|I also had a lot of injuries, which did not help me.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_366.wav|57|But I managed.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_360.wav|72|It's a drop in the bucket.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_123.wav|73|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_205.wav|33|It's not a new device.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_196.wav|86|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_062.wav|31|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_203.wav|29|It was served by sheriff officers.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_400.wav|26|The car was just there.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_337.wav|8|The next week is crucial.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_016.wav|87|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_025.wav|47|She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_338.wav|28|It's our worst nightmare.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_368.wav|23|The men are safe and unharmed.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_292.wav|60|I am in a good position.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_123.wav|22|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_215.wav|24|British Midland has applied for permission to fly to the US.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_162.wav|38|But he was a full, working member of our staff.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_004.wav|66|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_034.wav|83|It is marvellous.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_276.wav|35|It succeeds in a direct and convincing manner.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_059.wav|26|We welcome the decision of Mr Byers.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_315.wav|69|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_288.wav|98|Yet he remains confident enough.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_379.wav|21|The call was ignored.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_257.wav|48|We have a budget in March.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_179.wav|28|He didn't have long to wait.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_393.wav|46|Even for a British Open, this is different.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_271.wav|47|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_048.wav|3|It is all starting to come together.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_072.wav|35|Why do it otherwise ?
DUMMY2/p237/p237_201.wav|61|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_461.wav|48|Inventories are coming under control.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_197.wav|59|His third goal was superb.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_333.wav|105|Like his acting, it was an accident.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_181.wav|105|They need to look after themselves.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_169.wav|68|For athletes in our current climate, their sport is their livelihood.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_380.wav|47|Colour was at the core of his life.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_243.wav|88|The car driver was not injured.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_052.wav|101|Already, he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_020.wav|43|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_004.wav|26|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_336.wav|25|The composer will conduct.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_419.wav|77|It was important to win the singles.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_272.wav|54|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_391.wav|103|I'm happy to contribute to that.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_389.wav|2|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_408.wav|37|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
DUMMY2/p279/p279_155.wav|25|He then asked if he could have her seat and she refused.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_014.wav|38|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_354.wav|91|Clearly, she says, she would never resort to such devices.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_145.wav|27|He realises his mistake.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_346.wav|4|It seemed so personal.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_416.wav|63|Three years ago he would have been.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_175.wav|90|If that's the case, he will struggle.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_317.wav|66|You will never forget the clutching horror.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_237.wav|51|This is wonderful news.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_401.wav|103|We are now open.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_167.wav|15|Not that he's declined.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_354.wav|104|We didn't mean to kill him.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_130.wav|54|McMaster is keen to draw attention to others.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_052.wav|10|He also presented You Bet!
DUMMY2/p258/p258_186.wav|26|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_106.wav|72|Jim Wallace has been running the Government.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_184.wav|43|It's a portrait of Glasgow, not the portrait.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_418.wav|15|As indeed it did.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_118.wav|31|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_199.wav|63|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_146.wav|63|He will get his chances.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_239.wav|10|So far, the problems have occurred in the US.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_373.wav|51|They want to avoid a flashpoint.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_353.wav|107|Investment in quality, service and marketing were the only way forward.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_172.wav|11|Councillor Gordon has refused to stand down.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_347.wav|0|He was then replaced by Ross.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_313.wav|23|Such adjustments have been the salvation of United.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_175.wav|57|As far as we were concerned the deal with Kennedy was dead.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_489.wav|65|That time may never be broken.)
DUMMY2/p245/p245_083.wav|59|Global Scotland will be held at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_239.wav|97|You must be ready to play anyone.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_033.wav|89|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_372.wav|85|It was our time maybe.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_279.wav|57|He will address the nation this evening.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_350.wav|83|That would help.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_273.wav|44|It is now very clear that that doesn't work.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_232.wav|22|That's the key issue isn't it?
DUMMY2/p299/p299_120.wav|58|You can see their point.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_266.wav|20|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_247.wav|25|We will need to study the report before any decision is taken.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_291.wav|19|It's never over until it's over.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_358.wav|21|It is a gamble.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_380.wav|60|What other retailer would do this?
DUMMY2/p363/p363_407.wav|6|There's nothing she can't do.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_353.wav|94|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_336.wav|60|I am very happy.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_221.wav|106|You've got to be vigilant.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_050.wav|71|"It has been a horrible, horrible time."
DUMMY2/p239/p239_004.wav|48|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_337.wav|26|He did a good job.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_163.wav|36|Shareholders may have to wait until June to be paid.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_217.wav|7|This will be our new beginning.)
DUMMY2/p361/p361_223.wav|79|We tried to get them down.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_067.wav|10|The fans would love it.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_080.wav|5|A play is a set of actions.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_286.wav|59|But it is understood to have happened after weeks of arguments.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_244.wav|28|His sister added, We expected him to be jailed.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_071.wav|2|It's now down in black and white.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_042.wav|63|He looks like an Afghan.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_112.wav|103|They could not hear.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_034.wav|7|She is employed on short-term contracts.)
DUMMY2/p228/p228_259.wav|57|They must play for each other.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_027.wav|1|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_195.wav|17|Smuggling is an increasing problem for the Government.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_116.wav|103|She had been sexually assaulted.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_136.wav|47|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_415.wav|105|We shall be victorious.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_002.wav|67|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_187.wav|58|The project is entitled The Composer in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_195.wav|7|But there's an upturn in the sector.)
DUMMY2/p230/p230_417.wav|35|We have to build a new team in the minimum of time.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_367.wav|75|The work with Alison was a great experience.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_149.wav|76|It will be about commitment, not compliance.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_273.wav|33|All my family are in Scotland, from Glasgow.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_002.wav|76|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_101.wav|58|It's amazing it happened in the daytime.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_112.wav|21|I would love to play in Europe again.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_294.wav|72|He met his wife and married in England.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_313.wav|94|They are wrong.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_292.wav|67|We have other options.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_312.wav|79|I knew him well.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_370.wav|100|The idea was first mooted a year ago.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_449.wav|50|And we might go back.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_377.wav|49|Only local people are helping.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_130.wav|75|I love the spectacle of cinema.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_398.wav|37|Standard Life has also highlighted ambitions in this market.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_403.wav|56|It is a large number.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_277.wav|62|Our legal advice is clear.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_282.wav|32|It is also very valuable.)
DUMMY2/p261/p261_323.wav|100|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_050.wav|43|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_296.wav|55|Friday night was a pretty good night.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_102.wav|107|Does it feel like the ideas and emotions?
DUMMY2/p267/p267_020.wav|0|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_360.wav|1|It is simple and easy to use.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_241.wav|56|Defensive stocks attracted some interest.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_222.wav|29|They have known the hard times.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_030.wav|47|I was an athlete.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_344.wav|64|His name is Michael Owen.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_356.wav|95|He declined to reveal the offer price which was accepted.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_221.wav|84|The FBI could become involved.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_327.wav|78|He is already in place.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_100.wav|92|You can take it almost anywhere and practise.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_405.wav|98|Is it any good?
DUMMY2/p243/p243_092.wav|53|Clark was delighted with the effort of Jones.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_076.wav|34|He had just returned to Thailand from Canada.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_313.wav|62|And they did just that.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_167.wav|85|It will be too hot.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_070.wav|53|But during the bid process, that changed completely.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_135.wav|62|But what lies ahead?
DUMMY2/p312/p312_109.wav|62|Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_481.wav|65|The parties include the Scottish Executive.)
DUMMY2/p231/p231_140.wav|50|I think he's the favourite, no question.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_304.wav|12|We've always had three options, and none of them perfect.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_016.wav|6|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_278.wav|7|I'm not making any specific attempt on the world record.)
DUMMY2/p329/p329_297.wav|103|She admitted the theft of letters and deception.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_268.wav|9|They are interior designers and architects.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_406.wav|1|We will deal with the refugees.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_398.wav|14|It is a simple equation.)
DUMMY2/p307/p307_162.wav|22|I understand the medical concerns.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_066.wav|68|Who, then, is going to be captain of Europe?
DUMMY2/p300/p300_276.wav|102|The threat to rural areas is real.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_234.wav|46|There were two things going on at once.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_268.wav|35|Scoring in our first game was a bonus for me.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_255.wav|38|I couldn't see any reason not to die.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_101.wav|104|It's annoying in a way.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_037.wav|104|He was taken to hospital, but later died.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_238.wav|52|The children were later able to leave by bus.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_079.wav|53|The squad spent the night at police headquarters.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_082.wav|9|You will be.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_091.wav|43|Someone who cares
DUMMY2/p245/p245_002.wav|59|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_336.wav|44|Thankfully, we have started to listen to our customers.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_329.wav|96|We agreed to disagree.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_191.wav|70|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_391.wav|100|It's as wide as a church in here.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_050.wav|30|I know a lot of people who don't.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_248.wav|25|He's a lovely young man.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_393.wav|87|Calvin was always recognised as a player with potential.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_064.wav|35|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_039.wav|8|This represents a tough game for us.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_368.wav|96|It was one in the afternoon.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_399.wav|107|It remains in public ownership.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_220.wav|86|A career as a doctor is on hold.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_096.wav|55|Now comes the hard part.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_076.wav|36|There could be a lot of confusion.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_206.wav|79|We will be working on that this week, all right.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_170.wav|94|We have to move forward.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_410.wav|104|Mr Wilson has received no such request.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_225.wav|45|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_108.wav|6|He is obviously very dangerous.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_384.wav|2|It's just outrageous.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_278.wav|104|It is a very disturbing picture for men.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_103.wav|51|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_164.wav|88|I don't want to use the term.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_097.wav|13|That, though, is an old story.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_414.wav|18|Now we must look to the future.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_148.wav|54|This event allows us to emphasise the positive.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_384.wav|77|The pair are very much in love.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_012.wav|33|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_169.wav|42|I'm going to buy a car.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_039.wav|89|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_344.wav|20|Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_313.wav|60|The response from everyone was wonderful.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_025.wav|62|Perhaps that was their mistake.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_285.wav|89|The songs are just so good.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_309.wav|73|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_402.wav|78|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_457.wav|63|It was his job to check.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_030.wav|5|There's a story, too.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_036.wav|25|They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_396.wav|107|At present it is fairly uncommon, but its incidence is increasing.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_026.wav|72|Who cares about that?
DUMMY2/p267/p267_318.wav|0|People can really get themselves in a mess.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_096.wav|53|Earlier, both main parties had agreed a crucial stage had been reached.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_051.wav|75|They just thought it was extremely good acting.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_070.wav|18|It has only been rumours.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_049.wav|9|Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_074.wav|54|I've come here for the jersey.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_418.wav|63|But demand for space in Edinburgh is still strong.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_383.wav|11|It's the only thing.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_373.wav|41|It's a record label, not a form of music.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_364.wav|0|There may be reasons for it.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_069.wav|56|Stephen has never considered the question of compensation.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_100.wav|12|My office is bare.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_087.wav|88|I support the stand that they are making.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_385.wav|34|But is it ethical to practice in humans?
DUMMY2/p288/p288_250.wav|47|Scotland has competed in its own right in cycling.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_321.wav|5|It's too horrible to think.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_274.wav|37|He is a right bastard.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_269.wav|16|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_266.wav|99|Of course, that is not the whole story.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_106.wav|27|They make a selective perception process.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_076.wav|20|Today she has been released.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_270.wav|37|It's never great to finish second.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_152.wav|3|But it is different in different regions.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_110.wav|32|We have a team to reach the final.)
DUMMY2/p276/p276_095.wav|106|He's not getting into any games.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_122.wav|41|This is a scheme that has a lot of potential.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_363.wav|79|It was up to him.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_013.wav|27|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_127.wav|75|They made such decisions in London.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_127.wav|47|The goals were good.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_144.wav|95|Glasgow is a friendly city.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_276.wav|21|She is a valuable member of Government.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_014.wav|79|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_210.wav|80|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_385.wav|74|That is to miss the point.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_404.wav|107|I leave tonight for England.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_271.wav|86|But he is caught between a rock and a hard place.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_380.wav|32|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.)
DUMMY2/p231/p231_198.wav|50|It was a moment of madness.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_214.wav|58|Here are some possible solutions.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_110.wav|5|It is so sad.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_056.wav|88|Our commitment is to move forward.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_095.wav|32|It is for policy Ministers to defend their policies.)
DUMMY2/p229/p229_080.wav|67|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_219.wav|16|I didn't play too well in the third quarter.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_004.wav|95|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_027.wav|86|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_371.wav|67|He later became a respected High Court judge.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_122.wav|56|You are a gambling man.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_250.wav|38|Well, it's not before time, is it?
DUMMY2/p266/p266_101.wav|20|Tomorrow he will make a keynote speech on Europe.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_381.wav|54|The Chosen One doesn't always excel.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_229.wav|97|It would have very little impact on them.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_050.wav|33|Instead we were shot in the back.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_039.wav|103|We're still talking with a few people.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_201.wav|15|When it is ready, it will be signed.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_226.wav|47|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_082.wav|30|PR for Westminister is their holy grail.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_309.wav|87|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_170.wav|6|So what's in store?
DUMMY2/p225/p225_279.wav|101|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_411.wav|56|We can produce a blueprint for farmers to follow.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_124.wav|34|It will also take evidence from consumers.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_306.wav|30|We are determined to establish the facts.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_127.wav|17|Both offices were closed yesterday.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_241.wav|86|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_067.wav|49|I go home only once.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_027.wav|22|You need a long-term strategy in football.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_116.wav|85|This is totally untrue.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_142.wav|81|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_195.wav|58|We've got a great defensive club.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_180.wav|107|I foolishly had done nothing about it.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_339.wav|38|Last night was a key episode.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_258.wav|71|"That review will look at management across the sector as a whole."
DUMMY2/p262/p262_318.wav|45|It's about my time as a guitarist.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_257.wav|33|We had a court hearing in London yesterday.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_145.wav|3|I can't even get into the A team.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_078.wav|91|He accused the Prime Minister of dithering.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_270.wav|39|We were not allowed to go to help them.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_323.wav|41|My first concern is for the safety of the public.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_175.wav|69|As we worked.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_045.wav|87|Overall it has been deeply frustrating and disappointing.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_295.wav|17|The balance isn't there at EMI.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_387.wav|14|The team hadn't been picked.)
DUMMY2/p249/p249_291.wav|80|These figures are truly awful.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_314.wav|1|There's a lot of hysteria.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_126.wav|73|It is a time bomb.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_213.wav|31|We'll have to work hard today.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_215.wav|14|And they were being paid ?)
DUMMY2/p243/p243_123.wav|53|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_184.wav|67|They thought they had found a home.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_092.wav|0|They were a lovely couple.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_188.wav|91|I hope you miss the cut.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_131.wav|23|Well, it was part of our ongoing discussions.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_314.wav|8|Job losses were also announced.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_349.wav|50|What are they for ?
DUMMY2/p277/p277_438.wav|89|Horses are drawn by ballot.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_191.wav|54|We want to keep the pound.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_031.wav|20|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_307.wav|73|It's too horrible to think.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_308.wav|43|This is a war over our home.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_015.wav|95|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_322.wav|48|There were also some interesting questions and answers.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_268.wav|21|We are all suffering.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_162.wav|100|I would probably have to agree with him.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_138.wav|85|The case was taken on by his brother.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_330.wav|47|They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_245.wav|88|Colin Cameron was excellent.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_405.wav|100|After the match, do you ?
DUMMY2/p326/p326_269.wav|28|It will not be a long campaign.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_255.wav|35|Kingfisher can afford to wait.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_373.wav|49|We were short of athletes.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_312.wav|18|He did not report it.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_069.wav|67|Ferguson should take note.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_275.wav|23|Life becomes a song.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_267.wav|80|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_062.wav|51|Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_168.wav|84|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_311.wav|52|He is keen to stay in public service.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_353.wav|54|The fans will support us.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_086.wav|56|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_338.wav|98|I was in tears in the street.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_148.wav|6|It would be a masterclass.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_030.wav|8|He has the courage of the unaware.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_263.wav|9|It was a hit.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_260.wav|89|He was also married with two children.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_330.wav|4|If he could've prevented it happening, he would have.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_076.wav|63|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_248.wav|70|That could be in place by next year.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_202.wav|49|I looked forward to it.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_393.wav|49|From then on, Scott has never looked back.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_011.wav|97|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_103.wav|80|Until you hit the big games.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_086.wav|97|What did you learn in school today?
DUMMY2/p280/p280_339.wav|52|So is that it, then ?
DUMMY2/p285/p285_126.wav|2|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_323.wav|73|I would like to focus on a structure and a target.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_240.wav|48|They should stop the bombing.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_256.wav|106|Finding suitable replacements would not be easy.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_429.wav|40|However, he held out little hope that the Government would take action.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_092.wav|85|Today she has been released.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_237.wav|93|It is not the message alone.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_259.wav|19|Perhaps we should do the same.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_395.wav|82|I won't go back to Holland.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_016.wav|49|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_398.wav|69|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_142.wav|43|Government will intervene.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_218.wav|64|Or some thought that they have.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_191.wav|95|It's nice to be nice.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_203.wav|54|I think it was briefly considered.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_008.wav|29|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_091.wav|14|We have to offer value for money.)
DUMMY2/p248/p248_204.wav|99|Today was first class.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_110.wav|77|So what is the campaign about ?
DUMMY2/p278/p278_071.wav|10|It was a unanimous decision.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_108.wav|44|Today, however, half of them get this financial help.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_200.wav|95|I'm just going to hit the shot.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_153.wav|79|It has still to be recovered.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_189.wav|66|I've already done that.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_384.wav|4|He didn't really, we just made that up.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_215.wav|100|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_231.wav|70|We are so proud.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_116.wav|1|So, how will it be received in the US?
DUMMY2/p275/p275_211.wav|40|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_402.wav|94|The car was just there.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_277.wav|82|It was like the old days.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_450.wav|63|We make this offer to the parliament.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_043.wav|76|We are not moving in.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_389.wav|62|That's an old idea.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_372.wav|87|I have little time for analysts.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_185.wav|75|It is not either national standards or local control.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_003.wav|88|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_369.wav|24|He had no access to the database.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_006.wav|10|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_098.wav|18|This was dismissed as absolute nonsense.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_330.wav|42|There will have to be a full inquiry.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_262.wav|4|There are many questions to be answered.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_257.wav|24|Many farmers cannot even agree within their own families.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_305.wav|54|He admitted there were two aspects of fear.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_304.wav|22|They tried to give her advice.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_035.wav|52|It is about control of our economy.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_222.wav|58|Nato would ensure they could return home, he said.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_371.wav|27|It seems a long time ago.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_294.wav|19|That, though, is to miss the point.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_228.wav|93|It is a gamble.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_133.wav|54|You can never have enough money.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_033.wav|28|Roy Keane is certainly the best.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_312.wav|83|Henman has been warned.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_133.wav|90|Who will attend?
DUMMY2/p306/p306_083.wav|12|They are not an item.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_010.wav|58|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_074.wav|76|But you can go beyond that condition.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_299.wav|106|First, the programme was unbalanced.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_072.wav|87|We deserved the three points.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_258.wav|88|We deserved to get the victory today.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_077.wav|73|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_357.wav|36|It should be a great game, though.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_278.wav|60|The warning is timely.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_243.wav|29|My wife and family are the support system.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_404.wav|14|The BBC was a disgrace.)
DUMMY2/p323/p323_391.wav|34|Later they changed their minds.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_438.wav|39|I can't wait for the season to end.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_119.wav|4|He decides to do something about it.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_020.wav|107|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_287.wav|58|Quite simply, no-one else is willing to do so.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_088.wav|10|But they must believe in themselves.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_253.wav|66|I have heard the stories from Scotland.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_351.wav|85|There is a review outgoing at the moment.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_140.wav|36|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_462.wav|8|Something happened on that island.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_062.wav|97|This wasn't just a big crowd.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_110.wav|74|That's the way it goes.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_209.wav|47|It had all been arranged.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_211.wav|64|They must be kept on the ground.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_103.wav|57|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_348.wav|11|We won't go down without a struggle.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_222.wav|7|This decision will prove to be the opposite of a standstill.)
DUMMY2/p304/p304_037.wav|72|We have a strong team at the moment.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_054.wav|42|January is a bad time of year.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_341.wav|38|Looking at him is proof of the pudding.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_387.wav|40|They are good.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_198.wav|81|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_332.wav|1|Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_008.wav|38|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_119.wav|98|We just try to make great records.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_109.wav|29|You can spend money on housing.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_413.wav|17|People ask about the concept of a team.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_181.wav|30|Again, this was genuine loyalty being recognised.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_034.wav|94|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_260.wav|107|I started on fire a couple of times.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_299.wav|40|There were no passengers on board.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_381.wav|25|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_114.wav|5|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_225.wav|41|It's so special.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_251.wav|102|I am totally horrified by the sentence.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_027.wav|16|Is this accurate?
DUMMY2/p228/p228_028.wav|57|There's a story, too.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_001.wav|0|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_098.wav|59|Now, though, he believes that the new formation has helped his form.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_391.wav|27|I love the thought of having a crack at defending the title.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_110.wav|60|They offered to make an investment into it.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_338.wav|42|That was one very hard game.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_068.wav|24|The Farmer wants a new campaign.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_140.wav|22|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_157.wav|3|I have a lot of confidence in this team.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_070.wav|2|Even the one she loved.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_215.wav|64|This is a foolish idea.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_091.wav|87|THE Farmer wants a new campaign.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_284.wav|1|Equity declined to comment.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_147.wav|46|Too many factors are now working against him.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_246.wav|107|Thankfully, there were no reports of anything serious.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_300.wav|29|Stephen will get his first cap.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_379.wav|66|I didn't do too badly myself.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_135.wav|53|Her research is the second piece by Edinburgh University scientists highlighted recently.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_480.wav|7|Their one weakness was running between the wickets.)
DUMMY2/p297/p297_398.wav|42|Here is a weather forecast for the weekend.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_013.wav|20|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_280.wav|14|Scotland won by six wickets.)
DUMMY2/p376/p376_295.wav|71|"It became a book by itself."
DUMMY2/p310/p310_038.wav|17|We're still talking with a few people.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_412.wav|64|I have not come in to take over.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_375.wav|47|We do not get that impression now.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_289.wav|54|We would welcome a greater emphasis on carcasses.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_075.wav|91|It's an excellent idea that makes sense.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_235.wav|8|Investors were also concerned about margin pressure.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_128.wav|92|We will provide immediate access.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_286.wav|27|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_287.wav|68|There is no smoking gun.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_350.wav|77|My view has now completely changed.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_194.wav|106|There was a fossil on screen.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_478.wav|65|The union has threatened strike action unless these demands are met.)
DUMMY2/p267/p267_399.wav|0|That's all I can say.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_061.wav|97|There was no basis for their arrest.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_183.wav|72|This is it finally finished.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_293.wav|69|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_304.wav|10|John was there already in spirit.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_464.wav|100|Nine days later, he suffered another attack.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_031.wav|85|Naturally, she said yes.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_151.wav|84|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_205.wav|27|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_020.wav|40|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_403.wav|20|So I did.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_005.wav|74|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_381.wav|74|There was no question of him not impressing.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_340.wav|17|Quite simply, for once in his life, he got it wrong.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_209.wav|103|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_207.wav|54|It's part of the game, isn't it?
DUMMY2/p376/p376_133.wav|71|"Police could not say if the two incidents were connected."
DUMMY2/p293/p293_285.wav|23|They feel it belongs to them.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_068.wav|16|We should have known.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_231.wav|107|There is no reason at all.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_226.wav|59|It's quite a line-up!
DUMMY2/p333/p333_261.wav|64|The New Deal will constantly be improved.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_093.wav|65|Are you going to win?)
DUMMY2/p363/p363_059.wav|6|That is our objective.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_263.wav|12|That means no more taxation by stealth.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_137.wav|88|Destruction came from within.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_123.wav|37|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
DUMMY2/p253/p253_069.wav|70|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_285.wav|91|It was an empowering journey.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_357.wav|102|I've only met him three times.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_029.wav|91|But we're not the same person.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_300.wav|4|It would have to be backdated.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_257.wav|28|We would expect it to disappear in time.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_174.wav|30|They did, too, but it didn't matter by then.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_352.wav|93|That is the very reason why it was so vital.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_197.wav|20|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_163.wav|69|It is so unfair.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_189.wav|35|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_221.wav|40|During the communist time they were very privileged.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_306.wav|77|Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott appealed for privacy.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_345.wav|62|Then came the second round.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_076.wav|75|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_155.wav|98|It's very simple, no-one is forced to compete.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_116.wav|67|I was angry.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_225.wav|15|It also makes for interesting viewing.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_187.wav|75|The hotel was now for sale.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_060.wav|73|The tournament has now been cancelled.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_058.wav|103|I have had no social life at all.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_242.wav|9|They had no children.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_354.wav|86|As, indeed, they would be.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_160.wav|30|Councillor Gordon has refused to stand down.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_417.wav|39|His ambition was made this year when he played alongside his son.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_239.wav|41|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_062.wav|91|It didn't work against Sweden, but that was the intention.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_343.wav|4|I couldn't quite believe it, and still can't.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_003.wav|80|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_216.wav|48|We had to add value.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_081.wav|60|Nothing is going right at the moment.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_019.wav|100|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_116.wav|0|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_036.wav|38|We could feel the heat.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_403.wav|25|The weekly average was three hours.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_039.wav|94|That's no bad thing.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_262.wav|5|Blood samples were taken.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_370.wav|20|Twaddle is a case in point.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_210.wav|99|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_328.wav|83|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_287.wav|99|It is not normal practice.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_232.wav|41|We were a load of rubbish.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_084.wav|18|There is no change in the strategy.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_177.wav|47|It's a portrait of Glasgow, not the portrait.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_069.wav|102|Therefore, it isn't getting the respect it deserves.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_218.wav|16|It's not before time.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_275.wav|32|He is quite well organised.)
DUMMY2/p295/p295_246.wav|92|Their condition was described as stable yesterday.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_252.wav|10|After his birthday, Scott was very upset.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_240.wav|93|But it's a subtle process.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_117.wav|58|It felt like my support system was leaving.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_191.wav|45|I came home by ambulance.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_083.wav|11|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_343.wav|107|The feedback from audiences was just so positive.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_394.wav|92|It was visibly on fire.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_266.wav|26|It's all change on the music scene in Manchester.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_253.wav|83|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_129.wav|42|This would give Scotland around eight members.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_355.wav|92|He is very much in our thoughts.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_098.wav|1|Many other Scottish locations also feature.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_058.wav|107|We must improve our relations with government.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_115.wav|80|You had better believe it.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_001.wav|88|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_341.wav|79|And we are doing it.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_152.wav|50|The point is raised again that evening at the Assembly Rooms.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_331.wav|45|The parents will have a great time, too.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_174.wav|88|This has been fantastic.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_077.wav|27|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_371.wav|33|Frustration is not the word.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_389.wav|68|Both agreed on the success of the event.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_162.wav|87|The milk industry is in turmoil.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_086.wav|10|It was clear on Thursday.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_357.wav|52|It is the only natural British site on the list.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_208.wav|0|From there, they can go anywhere.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_020.wav|75|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_046.wav|12|We will continue to operate within the sport.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_228.wav|20|They will be stopped, and they will be punished.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_304.wav|72|Hopefully, they will not go through with it.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_003.wav|86|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_276.wav|107|We've turned the corner.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_466.wav|100|The Edinburgh audience was able to understand the dialogue.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_078.wav|68|We just try to make great records.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_378.wav|103|I see no reason for them to be.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_128.wav|28|His father and mother are in film production.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_149.wav|92|I can't say that this is very usual.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_389.wav|79|I think it was entirely the right decision.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_185.wav|92|The board would report to the Scottish Parliament.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_382.wav|32|Both of those promises have already been honoured.)
DUMMY2/p244/p244_303.wav|78|We have to be realistic.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_260.wav|41|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_175.wav|31|As far as we were concerned the deal with Kennedy was dead.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_283.wav|79|But it's the truth.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_191.wav|82|It's not only my respect for them.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_409.wav|103|Players were held in equally low regard.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_301.wav|55|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_038.wav|89|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_282.wav|49|Arsenal considered the job done.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_372.wav|16|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_392.wav|52|Five years ago its return was rejected.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_152.wav|5|The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_231.wav|25|They are the innocent victims.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_049.wav|46|Everything was an effort.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_130.wav|24|The situation is not easy, but we will prevail.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_247.wav|63|A small number of new jobs will also be created.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_305.wav|10|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_118.wav|8|You were made to feel so welcome.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_029.wav|8|It was as if I had been stabbed.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_187.wav|82|It's all too early.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_181.wav|9|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_045.wav|70|They want to be entertained.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_214.wav|33|No decision has yet been made.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_072.wav|19|Before the games it was pretty open.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_206.wav|13|The next one comes up.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_084.wav|104|It is a very genuine prospect.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_017.wav|71|"Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. "
DUMMY2/p263/p263_105.wav|39|The investment will be in the food.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_397.wav|106|The most important thing in theatre is to listen.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_304.wav|63|The circumstances have changed since last year.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_026.wav|94|But it failed.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_297.wav|52|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_018.wav|79|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_285.wav|48|It has been recorded twice.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_225.wav|98|Barry Ferguson is one of them.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_087.wav|104|They have to work so hard.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_396.wav|78|I understand the frustration of the fans.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_147.wav|70|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_048.wav|100|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_256.wav|33|The old manager, he didn't like me.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_103.wav|24|It is an old family habit.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_223.wav|34|I became a widow overnight.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_413.wav|4|We haven't been told.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_272.wav|94|On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_004.wav|4|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_369.wav|27|Now, though, he has an incentive.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_022.wav|18|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_268.wav|15|I want to concentrate on the real issues.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_066.wav|0|Do I have a favourite ?
DUMMY2/p250/p250_091.wav|24|We are progressing with a few interested parties.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_308.wav|52|Further heavy charges are expected this year.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_337.wav|97|I was not a joiner.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_177.wav|41|The clarity is vital.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_138.wav|81|It's hard to make these decisions at my age.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_230.wav|32|The performance continues to improve.)
DUMMY2/p323/p323_306.wav|34|I would ask the fans to be patient.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_316.wav|14|Clydesdale Bank declined to comment.)
DUMMY2/p345/p345_311.wav|82|I wouldn't have had the abandon.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_415.wav|42|It's a delightful idea, but a distancing one.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_340.wav|24|There will be good prospects ahead.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_249.wav|82|It is understood he had been stabbed.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_171.wav|84|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_387.wav|68|In all cases computer equipment was seized.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_009.wav|99|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_397.wav|103|It brings together two essential elements.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_309.wav|76|I find this ongoing debate is demeaning.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_420.wav|15|They were outside the circle.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_261.wav|26|I am very angry.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_249.wav|95|This is an exciting time for the party.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_228.wav|57|It is a gamble.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_350.wav|104|There were no violations.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_331.wav|33|That has not been the case, as we now know.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_081.wav|91|He came in an army uniform.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_106.wav|20|She reflects a bit.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_302.wav|78|This is a historic agreement.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_370.wav|8|But BA said the prediction was premature.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_023.wav|71|"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. "
DUMMY2/p275/p275_426.wav|40|I want a career.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_301.wav|28|English is the language of pop music.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_175.wav|96|You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_226.wav|31|His death was a tragic accident.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_049.wav|100|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_203.wav|88|I've got nothing to say.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_346.wav|41|It's all going to clear the debt.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_026.wav|104|The show is sold out, like the others in the run.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_270.wav|10|And they were being paid ?
DUMMY2/p232/p232_188.wav|96|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_364.wav|60|That gives it a spirit.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_323.wav|107|I'm getting long in the tooth.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_069.wav|40|He was at home with his pals.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_379.wav|75|The seller was not revealed.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_007.wav|76|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_330.wav|74|Let's make him a show.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_153.wav|25|It was the same at Twickenham.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_380.wav|14|The policy has led to a big increase in customer recruitment.)
DUMMY2/p336/p336_172.wav|98|It could last five months.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_270.wav|63|I should think so, too.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_013.wav|0|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_082.wav|69|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_322.wav|14|Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.)
DUMMY2/p339/p339_046.wav|18|That is not the place for her.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_364.wav|100|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_306.wav|48|This will be our new beginning.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_243.wav|5|The scene is about this?
DUMMY2/p266/p266_372.wav|20|It is a simple equation.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_024.wav|42|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_298.wav|95|This news came after the stock market closed on Monday.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_196.wav|59|I had decided to quit the show.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_014.wav|57|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_418.wav|98|It is my decision and my decision alone.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_274.wav|66|So there's a double whammy.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_274.wav|58|We have got a full house tonight.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_198.wav|91|Her condition last night was described as critical.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_307.wav|46|That is where the club has gone wrong.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_396.wav|104|We are on the path of change.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_315.wav|1|The casualties were not named.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_420.wav|11|It feels like too much.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_291.wav|13|For that much we must be grateful.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_242.wav|65|They are expected to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court today.)
DUMMY2/p244/p244_023.wav|78|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_346.wav|0|It wasn't a flight of fancy.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_144.wav|71|"The idea is simple."
DUMMY2/p323/p323_355.wav|34|Talks will then resume again in the autumn.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_098.wav|102|There are a huge number of arts.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_334.wav|101|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_188.wav|45|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_292.wav|29|Both companies have had a rough ride in recent years.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_224.wav|59|It is not the message alone.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_122.wav|13|It certainly should not be used too often.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_159.wav|104|You've been working for four years.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_237.wav|62|We must not give in to the bastards.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_195.wav|64|There was no happy ending.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_404.wav|7|This remains the party's policy.)
DUMMY2/p241/p241_331.wav|86|It's been hard.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_004.wav|3|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_249.wav|11|I get very excited by that.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_012.wav|30|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_169.wav|13|I was never alone with her, right?
DUMMY2/p229/p229_098.wav|67|She's got to say something.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_159.wav|106|But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_223.wav|44|Now, however, it has undergone a dramatic decline.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_361.wav|38|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_013.wav|4|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_286.wav|97|Blood samples were taken.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_155.wav|105|The weather forecast isn't good.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_174.wav|83|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_094.wav|39|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_064.wav|21|He has really done well.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_054.wav|27|I guess I was lucky, though.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_056.wav|46|My thoughts are with their families.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_392.wav|46|They could take the result away from them, couldn't they.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_168.wav|6|We have been together for five years.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_133.wav|34|We didn't turn it into the inspectors.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_292.wav|15|I have never felt so well.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_188.wav|78|That is a question for the next manager.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_229.wav|68|But there has never been the time, she said.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_317.wav|94|It's just not funny!
DUMMY2/p260/p260_220.wav|81|The report is due out next month.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_237.wav|19|We have the support of Scottish Natural Heritage.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_390.wav|92|We don't even know his name.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_347.wav|34|Before the game we went for a pint.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_122.wav|99|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_231.wav|43|The track is currently covered in snow.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_325.wav|57|The same things will happen with GM foods.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_222.wav|71|"Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable."
DUMMY2/p257/p257_114.wav|105|It was the eighties.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_347.wav|77|They are now out in the cold.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_391.wav|36|I was as strong as a horse.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_100.wav|55|The circumstances have changed since last year.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_308.wav|66|We have to adapt to this level.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_317.wav|27|We are a peaceful people.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_229.wav|90|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_214.wav|14|I had relied on him.)
DUMMY2/p252/p252_284.wav|55|Oil stocks also provided a boost.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_405.wav|107|She didn't tell me anything the night before.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_184.wav|55|It is actually building on the existing business.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_326.wav|77|After some discussion they did.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_181.wav|42|I wish him well.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_275.wav|56|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_223.wav|72|We want to be separate from our neighbours.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_301.wav|93|A new school will be built.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_263.wav|38|I would like Glasgow.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_342.wav|59|I'm very lucky.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_138.wav|13|Elections would follow in about two years.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_368.wav|45|I am not willing to say anything about any couple.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_167.wav|58|That's how it worked in Bosnia.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_443.wav|37|Still, some additions are inspired.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_025.wav|104|They were the better team on the night.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_321.wav|107|My players have no idea about football.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_387.wav|70|They are good.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_347.wav|89|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_148.wav|92|At the moment, the success in Germany is good.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_186.wav|75|City sentiment is in his favour.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_186.wav|48|That was just one night.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_413.wav|63|Thankfully, Peter had already found another outlet for his talents.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_082.wav|106|So, did she meet him ?
DUMMY2/p226/p226_199.wav|43|We live by the rule of law.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_207.wav|22|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_101.wav|29|I did not see any reason to change the captain.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_343.wav|34|People wouldn't have quite understood the language.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_262.wav|37|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_031.wav|72|In fact, we were all over the shop.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_314.wav|90|It is all credit to them today.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_225.wav|24|I think, therefore I am ?
DUMMY2/p270/p270_272.wav|8|I think, therefore I am ?
DUMMY2/p226/p226_086.wav|43|This is the way things should be handled.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_056.wav|105|It's very odd.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_293.wav|88|I know we ask a lot of you.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_195.wav|9|It is a case of taking a risk.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_360.wav|21|The tribunal continues today.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_135.wav|45|It would be a last resort.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_286.wav|25|Maloney is an engaging talent.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_107.wav|25|Before the game we went for a pint.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_037.wav|31|Dancing was her life.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_307.wav|40|There's no evidence he was ever there.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_198.wav|0|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_286.wav|50|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_407.wav|56|But the foundations have been laid.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_352.wav|62|And she's not even in the book!
DUMMY2/p226/p226_078.wav|43|There could be a way back.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_012.wav|6|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_016.wav|95|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_318.wav|31|I asked for a positive response and I was given one.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_254.wav|6|We stopped at half-time.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_229.wav|82|It will be all about the Olympics.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_152.wav|67|We just had a go.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_207.wav|107|Why should we even be asked to share?
DUMMY2/p308/p308_135.wav|107|The European Court is our only option.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_218.wav|46|You'll get on like a house on fire.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_105.wav|24|He was released after treatment.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_179.wav|88|But he did not rule out further talks.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_132.wav|69|No production was achieved.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_261.wav|94|Kirkwood was arrested.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_153.wav|46|But he is not using them.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_176.wav|8|They could not match it.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_367.wav|6|She had not suffered any physical injury.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_296.wav|87|They need to be involved.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_258.wav|11|It is a technique.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_144.wav|62|Neither was in the squad announced yesterday.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_303.wav|11|I've already got this.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_016.wav|34|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_019.wav|12|Since then physicists have found that is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_247.wav|87|The best thing for me was to join the Army.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_360.wav|103|No, is the answer to your first question.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_379.wav|87|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_011.wav|102|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_152.wav|57|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_316.wav|31|Henman has been warned.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_364.wav|78|However, it has to be seen as part of a package.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_219.wav|15|This plan is an agenda for action.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_108.wav|38|We are satisfied with this outcome.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_018.wav|15|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_020.wav|19|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_005.wav|20|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_110.wav|46|It needs somebody to give way.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_277.wav|57|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_292.wav|57|He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_136.wav|42|We were extremely poor.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_085.wav|97|McNaughton was not so sure.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_261.wav|75|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_348.wav|34|The auction will be held tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_124.wav|101|As for the warning, it was not needed.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_024.wav|96|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_387.wav|95|But the main issue will be the sale of Burger King.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_419.wav|42|Hollywood comedy is having a good week.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_210.wav|19|Sadly, too, many of them are similar.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_399.wav|97|It shows that painting is still relevant.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_340.wav|68|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_148.wav|63|What happened in that game ?
DUMMY2/p335/p335_392.wav|49|We have been working closely with Holyrood.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_143.wav|45|Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_030.wav|53|She brought a lot to my life.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_411.wav|98|His attacker has been a Rangers fan.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_184.wav|75|The Hibs manager is no fool.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_085.wav|35|However, it did not end that way.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_265.wav|60|There is no answer to it.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_318.wav|33|He had no access to the database.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_178.wav|3|I was always in control.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_285.wav|15|I'm very relaxed about that indeed.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_459.wav|24|The jury is still out.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_201.wav|13|Lockerbie has been a terrible disaster for everyone.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_368.wav|25|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_436.wav|36|Size is not the issue.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_270.wav|20|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_019.wav|80|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_166.wav|107|I was doing well at the hustings.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_147.wav|7|Does the name matter ?)
DUMMY2/p241/p241_265.wav|86|It's very nice.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_233.wav|81|The car was just there.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_021.wav|37|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_037.wav|3|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_208.wav|10|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_198.wav|100|He should emerge as the winner.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_007.wav|39|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_061.wav|42|Basically, the classical tradition won out.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_295.wav|79|Who wants to be a millionaire?
DUMMY2/p364/p364_308.wav|88|They were very responsive.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_122.wav|89|It is rubbish.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_299.wav|83|It could work.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_286.wav|107|The new system will be marketed this summer.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_132.wav|3|The problem was a social problem.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_385.wav|105|Emotions were complex.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_279.wav|80|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_316.wav|81|Special measures were needed.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_235.wav|63|I am considered a teenager.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_296.wav|100|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_126.wav|23|Eriksson, though, was having none of it.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_054.wav|35|We should be able to cope.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_093.wav|29|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_094.wav|99|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_361.wav|65|It shows we're not much of a rugby country.)
DUMMY2/p251/p251_260.wav|9|His body was never found.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_293.wav|95|None of the agencies was able to help.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_086.wav|102|I have made good progress.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_308.wav|78|Every character was completely different.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_351.wav|17|They are the innocent victims.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_248.wav|52|The pair will meet again in Glasgow, and then train together in Australia.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_028.wav|55|He does not even trust his own members.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_073.wav|28|The Insider opens tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_422.wav|85|We won very easily.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_018.wav|33|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_016.wav|69|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_215.wav|48|That group reported just before Christmas.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_039.wav|95|He is believed to live in Britain.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_236.wav|52|That is the last thing they need.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_181.wav|63|People should not become complacent.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_247.wav|47|A friendship that will endure.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_163.wav|71|"He's been the key to everything."
DUMMY2/p277/p277_279.wav|89|Maloney is an engaging talent.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_315.wav|34|All things are possible if you believe.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_127.wav|79|Social workers are on stand-by to help.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_307.wav|48|They have the cash and the fire power.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_107.wav|39|Gordon Marshall was outstanding against us.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_412.wav|15|We're going to rebuild.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_141.wav|82|I don't have any perspective on it.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_358.wav|63|The pain is still acute.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_329.wav|15|The process itself has taken over.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_224.wav|26|It's so special.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_004.wav|104|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_237.wav|15|He now lives in Edinburgh with his wife, Caroline.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_259.wav|74|The game will be at a football stadium.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_077.wav|63|Even the one she loved.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_320.wav|68|I am proud of those guys.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_343.wav|26|There's no place to hide.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_381.wav|27|Since then, he has played no active part in the company.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_335.wav|104|But it took a lot of bottle.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_014.wav|20|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_105.wav|57|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_254.wav|84|Her presence was almost everywhere.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_190.wav|76|Patients will be partners in decision making.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_108.wav|56|I didn't think so either.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_088.wav|76|This could be her way forward.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_147.wav|103|But, even so, you always want to try something new.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_007.wav|72|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_103.wav|10|Are you from the rugby ?
DUMMY2/p243/p243_129.wav|53|It's so nice to see the reaction on their faces.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_017.wav|92|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_346.wav|50|We are encouraged by the news.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_119.wav|97|I was in the train station overnight.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_064.wav|9|An appeal against the sentence was dismissed the following year.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_278.wav|50|The joint bid is still on course.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_407.wav|38|My wife and family are the support system.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_383.wav|63|Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_467.wav|14|They're just a good retailer.)
DUMMY2/p362/p362_156.wav|15|He is having a nightmare.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_110.wav|62|I thought that all musicians were the same.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_132.wav|32|I feel very grateful with everything.)
DUMMY2/p237/p237_039.wav|61|The problem is the pitch.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_122.wav|47|So the European elections are extremely important.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_390.wav|96|That's the name of the game, though.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_191.wav|17|This is the first job of the director - leadership.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_241.wav|26|They are all bright and different.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_366.wav|24|Look at the Liberal Democrats.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_182.wav|21|I hope that that will be forthcoming.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_318.wav|80|The problems began a long time ago.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_105.wav|93|It was really enjoyable on Saturday.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_433.wav|65|He doesn't need to hit people.)
DUMMY2/p307/p307_012.wav|22|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_219.wav|47|Mental health is a massive issue.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_149.wav|57|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_031.wav|44|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_041.wav|0|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_117.wav|100|It's not a quick fix.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_360.wav|98|Its future is no longer in question.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_386.wav|4|There are big names.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_288.wav|16|We are not going to forget.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_151.wav|27|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_042.wav|103|There are big names.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_387.wav|7|He had no previous convictions.)
DUMMY2/p279/p279_354.wav|25|It's that sort of night.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_068.wav|56|The creditors have lost a lot.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_347.wav|18|I don't want to go anywhere.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_109.wav|38|We have it on video.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_187.wav|107|Luckily, our patient was stable.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_392.wav|96|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_398.wav|46|Some of the players have not progressed.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_082.wav|82|It is a freedom.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_022.wav|0|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of a super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_256.wav|38|My players have no idea about football.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_326.wav|23|It possibly depends on the position.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_387.wav|60|They're all doing it.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_400.wav|1|All the teachers are Afghan refugees.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_117.wav|22|Since then, they have fallen by more than two thirds.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_203.wav|28|For the moment, our position remains the same.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_105.wav|67|They were outside the circle.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_052.wav|51|The prognosis is excellent.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_283.wav|11|And we're not there yet.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_307.wav|83|The Premier League has been a huge success.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_232.wav|87|Years ago it was really quite simple.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_024.wav|20|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_219.wav|3|I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_362.wav|74|He said nothing of the sort.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_180.wav|43|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_206.wav|42|From day one, we were a family.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_164.wav|83|I'd love to be like Peter.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_407.wav|107|No evidence that it was Osama bin Laden.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_354.wav|65|Both watched her win yesterday.)
DUMMY2/p361/p361_402.wav|79|It's a dead end.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_068.wav|85|This is far too high.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_159.wav|12|They thought they had found a home.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_052.wav|42|All will be revealed in due course.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_301.wav|43|However, the snow was welcomed by some.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_208.wav|25|There was no rescue.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_288.wav|100|It would be a tragedy if it had to close.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_028.wav|95|The idea is not new.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_056.wav|45|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_395.wav|77|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_377.wav|0|People are on the alert.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_126.wav|54|I would welcome a proper, public discussion on this issue.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_169.wav|47|The jury is still out.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_238.wav|48|Further details are expected later.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_254.wav|24|Paterson can afford to be generous.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_034.wav|18|I want somebody with something to prove.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_138.wav|18|I have fallen in love with the Highlands.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_136.wav|10|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_216.wav|105|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_010.wav|0|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_334.wav|107|Its national defence policy is defensive in nature.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_140.wav|77|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_338.wav|31|The Scottish Prison Service said it could not comment on the visit.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_368.wav|27|The death rates are still as high.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_059.wav|44|The partnership was set up during the summer.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_214.wav|65|Three hit the target.)
DUMMY2/p335/p335_064.wav|49|This must be wrong.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_280.wav|54|The case will now go to appeal.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_386.wav|1|I am not a happy man.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_243.wav|89|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_255.wav|91|I am not holding the club to ransom.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_055.wav|55|I think I'm a bit too young.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_023.wav|37|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_368.wav|60|Having done it, he was asked again.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_388.wav|69|It is unusual.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_010.wav|11|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_340.wav|3|That is always a problem.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_251.wav|48|The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_342.wav|24|The letters are going out today.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_283.wav|100|I am just trying to do my job.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_156.wav|91|But you can't have it both ways.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_081.wav|104|They could not have done more for me.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_279.wav|100|That should be the subject matter of a public debate.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_019.wav|40|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_029.wav|58|My first season in Scotland was fantastic.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_094.wav|88|They have not seen her for years.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_342.wav|46|Britain is a peaceful nation.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_132.wav|34|This will have no effect on the championship.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_009.wav|52|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_060.wav|83|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_350.wav|79|It wasn't about her singing, though.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_111.wav|27|The cause of the fire is not yet known.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_319.wav|31|For the moment, our position remains the same.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_278.wav|80|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_324.wav|106|Did it work ?
DUMMY2/p280/p280_098.wav|52|Over one million people have been forced from their homes.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_256.wav|99|they fail to engage.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_067.wav|60|But he just carried on anyway.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_405.wav|49|You name it, they have it.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_127.wav|76|Why is this?
DUMMY2/p335/p335_002.wav|49|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_398.wav|11|That's a lot of bodies to tolerate.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_116.wav|48|I've had it for the exams.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_311.wav|76|Could you put it in writing?
DUMMY2/p279/p279_295.wav|25|He should have won.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_269.wav|19|The conference is the first test.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_375.wav|77|SE is well down that road.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_426.wav|95|No date has been set for a meeting.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_364.wav|17|It is a decision which has paid off.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_034.wav|14|The company did not declare a dividend.)
DUMMY2/p282/p282_028.wav|83|However, the following year the cancer returned.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_357.wav|17|He was down the right, the left, and through the middle.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_328.wav|59|The same things will happen with GM foods.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_204.wav|77|What are you not good at ?
DUMMY2/p278/p278_276.wav|10|They are interior designers and architects.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_250.wav|56|Paterson can afford to be generous.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_130.wav|98|Audacious decisions were taken early on.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_007.wav|86|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_264.wav|77|It does not work that way in Scottish football.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_464.wav|75|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_396.wav|66|But it is all by design.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_445.wav|37|The whole experience was uplifting and heartbreaking at the same time.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_267.wav|81|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_277.wav|37|He is not a pathetic figure.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_052.wav|72|She was only doing her job.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_247.wav|64|Glasgow is making inroads in some areas.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_224.wav|96|That has been the easy part.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_304.wav|73|They had a confession.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_082.wav|101|That view is held by many others within the industry.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_326.wav|39|The following year was a miserable time for Mr Dewar.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_407.wav|40|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_035.wav|44|They are interior designers and architects.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_254.wav|43|At the end of the day, one has to be careful.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_267.wav|13|Just what we didn't need.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_209.wav|92|We need to know more about her.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_346.wav|97|A decision is expected next March.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_351.wav|3|His concern is only for the future.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_365.wav|100|He was then replaced by Ross.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_446.wav|36|But we have built a platform for next season.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_226.wav|32|William Hague delighted his party.)
DUMMY2/p336/p336_096.wav|98|Sub Not Used, Mackay.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_364.wav|77|Three years ago he would have been.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_204.wav|80|Sir Paul McCartney said he had been shocked by the attack.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_114.wav|37|If they liked it then I'll be happy.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_223.wav|87|It opens the door to the Champions League.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_222.wav|106|I learned that only yesterday.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_319.wav|92|There's a good chance of seeing something.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_177.wav|85|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarerry.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_274.wav|11|He got very close tonight.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_251.wav|19|Which, in effect, it is.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_216.wav|54|That doesn't mean the Cabinet has to endorse.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_395.wav|16|We try to keep it right.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_311.wav|29|I'm looking for work in Bath and back home in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_357.wav|92|Our Great Depression is our lives.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_408.wav|64|There's nothing for you here.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_251.wav|46|Everyone can be bought.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_292.wav|84|It was a virus.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_144.wav|94|It seems so long since I did the exams.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_367.wav|38|This was a chilling echo.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_037.wav|91|He released a half-dozen solo albums.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_221.wav|24|That might help a bit.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_174.wav|89|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_152.wav|42|I will go out with him any time.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_195.wav|102|I would like Glasgow.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_098.wav|21|I am not a fan of books.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_320.wav|36|Scotland has shown the way.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_254.wav|5|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_394.wav|17|There was only one hole in it.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_195.wav|12|I would like Glasgow.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_041.wav|55|I'm so happy that she did.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_411.wav|48|You can feel at home in China.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_101.wav|42|That gives it a spirit.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_065.wav|60|He was pronounced dead at the scene.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_304.wav|4|We have worked well with them for years.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_392.wav|6|It has been a massive success.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_274.wav|9|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_284.wav|91|That's when you hope to take advantage.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_312.wav|37|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_111.wav|22|The Labour Party's not downbeat, and neither is the Labour Government.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_362.wav|51|It's being very carefully looked at.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_364.wav|83|It is a simple equation.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_369.wav|66|It's always nice to play on Centre Court.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_002.wav|69|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_039.wav|60|I'm so grateful for that.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_163.wav|24|It opens the door to the Champions League.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_191.wav|58|I can't stand this sort of stuff.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_043.wav|29|I'd come back from London.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_222.wav|98|The warnings were a good reminder.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_242.wav|38|A venue was found.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_340.wav|27|I've got no secret.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_377.wav|76|She's currently in foster care.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_097.wav|103|Drugs are always an issue.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_260.wav|22|That's the sort of game you want.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_064.wav|76|I learned a lot from that.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_380.wav|0|We operate as a Scottish company.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_214.wav|85|I am really sorry that he is going.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_193.wav|45|Our strategy is straightforward.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_157.wav|68|There is precious little middle ground.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_047.wav|23|That was the theory, anyway.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_341.wav|82|This is his first movie.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_087.wav|21|No one was listening.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_010.wav|42|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_170.wav|34|The stakes are high.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_096.wav|80|Now the system is right behind us.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_256.wav|12|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_362.wav|4|I hope he would have been very pleased.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_176.wav|104|You have to go to the edges.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_197.wav|89|It was worth a photograph.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_148.wav|65|Do I think about them often?)
DUMMY2/p340/p340_281.wav|74|One thing is clear.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_024.wav|24|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_284.wav|87|Injuries have taken their toll.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_126.wav|21|It has been a great day.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_412.wav|79|He is very sensitive.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_314.wav|99|The parents will have a great time, too.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_036.wav|26|It is not for any other purpose.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_262.wav|99|That is highly unfair.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_290.wav|71|"A new school will be built."
DUMMY2/p265/p265_135.wav|73|That group reported just before Christmas.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_087.wav|23|It's an hour of the same response.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_103.wav|20|That would be unlawful.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_238.wav|13|This is my home town.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_183.wav|103|She is, however, fully conscious and able to speak.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_291.wav|105|They are wrong.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_022.wav|33|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_005.wav|43|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_052.wav|35|None has ever been found.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_190.wav|5|The concerns are the same.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_146.wav|77|The strong pound also took its toll.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_199.wav|107|All of the names are familiar to me.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_039.wav|42|Her mother said, She didn't look very well at all.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_211.wav|5|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_066.wav|61|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_105.wav|51|That would be even more disastrous.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_119.wav|34|She added, It is the same story in both countries.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_086.wav|2|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_115.wav|49|But it will backfire.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_406.wav|104|It was very well received.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_112.wav|17|I will not be in dialogue with her.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_263.wav|49|There was no let-up for the minnows.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_281.wav|97|I think we're very different.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_046.wav|68|I did not want any damage to us.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_403.wav|64|This is a one-year deal, but who knows?
DUMMY2/p364/p364_131.wav|88|That's why he is a national treasure.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_374.wav|78|However, it does not seem to be the case.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_296.wav|101|It goes back a long way.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_025.wav|95|That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_006.wav|103|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_132.wav|21|The dictator of Iraq is not disarming.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_317.wav|35|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_209.wav|87|I think he's the favourite, no question.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_055.wav|41|But it might have done.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_231.wav|74|They have already done that.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_287.wav|29|They can leave at any time.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_344.wav|10|Is there a waiting list ?
DUMMY2/p312/p312_295.wav|62|She said No, he's not in Elgin today.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_080.wav|18|What is the Barnett formula?
DUMMY2/p241/p241_004.wav|86|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_143.wav|67|We never said that we would walk through the third division.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_275.wav|76|The rubble was right up to the ceiling.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_310.wav|98|That was me today.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_494.wav|65|That means a ban on French products.)
DUMMY2/p251/p251_236.wav|9|It is a gamble.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_310.wav|69|It is a private matter between the firm and our staff.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_378.wav|15|SO, that is it for another year.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_332.wav|86|They should stop the bombing.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_025.wav|6|It's never been to committee.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_123.wav|15|It will be tight.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_039.wav|52|She will get through it I'm sure.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_131.wav|107|I heard some of his remarks.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_321.wav|83|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_107.wav|62|He will go a long way.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_394.wav|52|In my opinion, any transfer to a foreign club will help him progress.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_226.wav|102|I found a fault and it worked at it.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_073.wav|38|I had a sense of deja vu.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_386.wav|14|The pair are very much in love.)
DUMMY2/p244/p244_413.wav|78|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_327.wav|39|At the moment, it is very difficult to know.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_382.wav|51|There is a job to be done.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_054.wav|34|I don't think it is a drawback.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_077.wav|49|It's just for me.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_306.wav|69|You may have a short memory.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_127.wav|95|I am a committed European.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_387.wav|98|It's unusual to say the least.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_364.wav|23|I felt we had fallen back a little.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_232.wav|96|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_166.wav|104|There's been a mistake.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_128.wav|97|I haven't just gone in, done a three-hour rehearsal, and gone.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_221.wav|53|We hope for a fresh board with a fresh, clear look at things.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_219.wav|79|This has gone on too long.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_381.wav|38|His son is a local legend.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_304.wav|107|The snipers are also out.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_240.wav|15|They've got to get better.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_351.wav|6|Secondly, there is the question of money.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_102.wav|41|This reason is to do with the nature of the Scotland manager.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_075.wav|48|Let's not be too despondent.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_365.wav|77|He did a good job.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_022.wav|44|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_430.wav|50|It was a breathtaking moment.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_346.wav|65|We have no information on Iraq.)
DUMMY2/p236/p236_190.wav|75|It makes no influence on the public.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_369.wav|14|It is a stroke of genius.)
DUMMY2/p280/p280_210.wav|52|We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_185.wav|51|It was an empowering journey.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_038.wav|26|I was scared.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_360.wav|84|The criteria were laid down at the beginning of the season.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_188.wav|65|In short, the national team without Frank is like football without feet.)
DUMMY2/p305/p305_112.wav|54|There was an e-mail.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_030.wav|36|They've got their own agenda.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_313.wav|89|I came into this world with nothing.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_243.wav|51|I was just getting over the time difference.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_236.wav|75|I am considered a teenager.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_383.wav|53|I just felt that I was broken down.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_004.wav|41|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_263.wav|42|But something has been lost in the translation.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_444.wav|36|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_236.wav|56|My future is in the marathon.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_153.wav|29|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_250.wav|2|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_380.wav|37|It is the voice of the survivors.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_384.wav|48|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_172.wav|20|She said she would not welcome the flowers.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_123.wav|30|Do not go into government buildings.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_271.wav|37|I'm delighted that Celtic have done so well this season.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_384.wav|96|There is no signature.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_079.wav|82|He would have loved it.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_222.wav|3|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_004.wav|29|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_258.wav|101|We were not allowed to go to help them.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_099.wav|34|It does seem a mystery.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_004.wav|6|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_129.wav|105|So the European elections are extremely important.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_299.wav|25|Graeme was prepared.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_261.wav|57|His contract was then not renewed.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_319.wav|101|There's still a bit to go.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_332.wav|0|The problems began a long time ago.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_370.wav|103|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_303.wav|75|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_284.wav|71|"He was obviously very genuine."
DUMMY2/p262/p262_339.wav|45|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_188.wav|10|That's not fair to the supporters.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_364.wav|63|In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_305.wav|47|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_375.wav|0|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_166.wav|5|You had to go and see him.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_065.wav|50|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_078.wav|81|People must remain vigilant.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_091.wav|29|That is the important thing.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_317.wav|61|It is no surprise.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_344.wav|85|Not many people like to do that.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_096.wav|71|"It was mayhem."
DUMMY2/p334/p334_281.wav|38|They'll have to pay more.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_050.wav|98|It's the same with cinema.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_334.wav|14|And he goes with it.)
DUMMY2/p226/p226_172.wav|43|It became a book by itself.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_140.wav|55|As our national coach, Brown is done for.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_257.wav|29|Kingfisher can afford to wait.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_042.wav|66|I fell into it by accident.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_149.wav|43|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_139.wav|34|I can give no comment.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_318.wav|57|He was then replaced by Ross.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_094.wav|17|I agree with them.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_251.wav|60|Did he just want to be on telly?
DUMMY2/p243/p243_105.wav|53|I bought a flat six years ago.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_182.wav|36|The hotel was now for sale.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_011.wav|51|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_307.wav|106|I am astonished at attack.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_308.wav|105|The home team had an amazing start.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_191.wav|102|Twaddle is a case in point.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_182.wav|79|I can see it now.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_329.wav|46|There is no date on this document.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_086.wav|12|I have made good progress.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_193.wav|43|The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_053.wav|105|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_052.wav|14|The couple actually came upon the accident.)
DUMMY2/p295/p295_395.wav|92|It was a fiery game.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_105.wav|85|I would just like someone to confess.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_263.wav|89|We're in shock.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_398.wav|8|There was a substantial explosion.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_169.wav|74|It has been a waste of time.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_331.wav|34|If you could find it.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_093.wav|99|He was possessed
DUMMY2/p313/p313_174.wav|76|Dewar is the medium.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_173.wav|49|He is the example for all of us.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_084.wav|8|Last weekend was extremely frustrating.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_280.wav|50|The morale of the Yugoslav army is beginning to crack.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_036.wav|30|I wanted the illusion of space and depth.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_048.wav|11|However, it's good to turn the page.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_330.wav|75|I didn't have the reply.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_272.wav|60|Players have to accept this.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_347.wav|83|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_104.wav|29|And the match was not too bad, either.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_291.wav|40|Who can predict?
DUMMY2/p341/p341_234.wav|66|I would have dropped out otherwise.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_307.wav|14|But it has been an amazing experience.)
DUMMY2/p267/p267_351.wav|0|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_161.wav|50|Was it the wife ?
DUMMY2/p306/p306_108.wav|12|You either have him or you don't.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_076.wav|45|I'd like to continue that record.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_226.wav|15|Life becomes a song.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_113.wav|3|Our action is not the end, but the beginning of a process.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_065.wav|8|Final proposals will be published in February.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_221.wav|87|My players have no idea about football.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_064.wav|11|You, the British people, are the boss.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_327.wav|9|We are a peaceful people.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_296.wav|59|They are wrong.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_365.wav|86|The play is based on a real-life event.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_253.wav|19|It is a memorial.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_292.wav|87|Our destiny is in our own hands.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_331.wav|107|I'd go to bookshops.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_297.wav|62|It is highly unlikely.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_330.wav|57|It is so unfair.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_374.wav|38|They are a very powerful and tasty side.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_200.wav|2|They've got three-quarters of the way.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_210.wav|107|I was surprised by his response.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_134.wav|83|We work well together.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_216.wav|88|It's better to be happy.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_238.wav|42|He's a sort of mystery figure.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_058.wav|31|There will be tough opponents to this report.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_070.wav|97|And what does it cost, and who is paying?
DUMMY2/p333/p333_068.wav|64|John was a very nice man.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_140.wav|68|I played really well on the back nine.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_422.wav|72|I will go out with him any time.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_254.wav|29|It is a court case.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_025.wav|10|A shortlist is to be drawn up next month.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_401.wav|8|I was conceived in Aberdeen.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_106.wav|67|Two of the team became ill.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_062.wav|70|I expect a rapid response.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_349.wav|28|He was on a horse.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_341.wav|13|They will run in tandem with New Work.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_271.wav|2|It was very fast.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_020.wav|84|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_407.wav|77|I decided to take my time.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_304.wav|45|What has altered?
