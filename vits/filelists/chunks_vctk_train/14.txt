DUMMY2/p276/p276_172.wav|106|He was just like a godfather to it.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_024.wav|49|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_202.wav|35|Tommy is not a problem.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_286.wav|36|was everything done to save people ?
DUMMY2/p236/p236_481.wav|75|He will be advised by me.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_271.wav|99|He was also married with two children.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_138.wav|86|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_379.wav|58|And that's the question for the Chamber.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_310.wav|66|What are you going to do exactly?
DUMMY2/p288/p288_088.wav|47|Every time I play I do not understand their reaction.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_043.wav|70|The ambition this year is to improve on last.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_001.wav|29|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_106.wav|40|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_059.wav|57|That is very hard, alone.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_080.wav|25|I've been there.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_313.wav|1|They also intend to travel today.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_099.wav|3|That is the fact of the matter.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_032.wav|95|We speak about the performance.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_077.wav|66|The settlement could run to millions.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_258.wav|37|This is absolutely not true.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_207.wav|29|That might mean another delay.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_014.wav|43|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_453.wav|27|It had been in place since last July.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_037.wav|42|My fitness was very poor.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_371.wav|54|The Treasury confirmed that the latter was correct.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_075.wav|37|The wingers must have felt the cold.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_196.wav|83|I came home by ambulance.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_396.wav|16|Stewart will travel with some confidence.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_429.wav|27|We have the location, which is assured.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_005.wav|67|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_103.wav|13|I have got a knife.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_378.wav|19|That's the only thing that matters.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_357.wav|76|It seems very odd.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_111.wav|43|It was an adventure.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_008.wav|10|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_140.wav|85|And so the cycle continues.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_185.wav|19|The United Nations must act.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_423.wav|4|There will be no excuses on Wednesday.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_120.wav|31|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_034.wav|26|I'd like to continue that record.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_014.wav|54|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_189.wav|1|A board of inquiry has already been convened.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_105.wav|16|Oil embargo endorsed.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_135.wav|42|Worse still, he might be singing Lady in Red.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_276.wav|104|Neither of them was badly hurt.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_132.wav|83|We had a great time when we came with Easy Rider.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_301.wav|97|It is scheduled to go ahead next Saturday.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_196.wav|34|We work for the athlete.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_091.wav|1|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_441.wav|48|The stage was set for a showdown.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_099.wav|8|That time is not now, however.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_172.wav|28|That, however, can only be achieved by constant investment.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_201.wav|65|Scotland will not vote for New Labour next time.)
DUMMY2/p317/p317_391.wav|97|This looks like it is anything but open.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_024.wav|61|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_097.wav|22|He was married with a young child.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_448.wav|75|No options are excluded at all.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_355.wav|46|I foolishly had done nothing about it.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_378.wav|34|We have been extremely lucky this time.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_241.wav|76|World leaders expressed their sympathy.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_180.wav|53|I am secure in my own position.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_253.wav|12|A management agreement, however, was conceded.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_240.wav|69|There's the mix.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_251.wav|13|I said, What was that about?
DUMMY2/p339/p339_121.wav|18|We're very, very happy.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_085.wav|81|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_287.wav|31|My body is clearly capable.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_230.wav|50|They are the innocent victims.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_005.wav|61|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_085.wav|72|Smoking is also very important.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_188.wav|7|He played it like a veteran.)
DUMMY2/p292/p292_335.wav|13|The best option is to destroy the plants.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_276.wav|30|We have turned the corner.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_329.wav|47|The figures are bad, but not that bad.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_309.wav|35|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_116.wav|105|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_277.wav|105|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_232.wav|39|I am considered a teenager.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_280.wav|106|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_183.wav|85|Of course it is still possible.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_114.wav|49|The dealer is on notice.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_309.wav|98|We have chosen for the patients.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_101.wav|25|The selection process is still at a very early stage.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_157.wav|44|There is precious little middle ground.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_029.wav|105|Life was like a timetable.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_380.wav|39|This view was echoed by the other Scottish analyst.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_119.wav|93|She really suffered for her art.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_385.wav|28|I have to keep working hard.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_051.wav|68|This guy is never going to give up.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_317.wav|99|He was unable to come.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_035.wav|20|It was clear.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_181.wav|96|The clarity is vital.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_412.wav|17|They also have good neighbours.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_389.wav|13|Such cases are on the increase.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_047.wav|91|Lara is very, very much a girl.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_254.wav|1|That is a break with tradition.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_070.wav|58|They had had time for little else.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_103.wav|6|He demanded to speak to the boss.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_219.wav|75|You have caught a serial killer.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_447.wav|100|And we might go back.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_391.wav|35|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_305.wav|31|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_011.wav|22|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_131.wav|3|However, the bank denied that he was in the running.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_334.wav|17|We have a team to reach the final.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_258.wav|99|They must play for each other.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_345.wav|93|Three years ago he would have been.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_365.wav|10|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_035.wav|100|That was the case with David.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_277.wav|78|Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_358.wav|14|The pain is still acute.)
DUMMY2/p275/p275_142.wav|40|If people are genuine, then the problem is not Osama bin Laden.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_070.wav|84|This time, it might be for real.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_276.wav|101|He will make an excellent chief inspector.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_108.wav|10|We have got a race.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_411.wav|76|The next eight weeks are critical to us.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_011.wav|50|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_157.wav|21|I can't believe the buzz.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_269.wav|36|The capital costs are modest.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_324.wav|103|The South African defended his work ethic.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_352.wav|95|Another reason is a shortage of stock.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_081.wav|98|The issues are not going to change.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_115.wav|65|That's the bit that's wrong.)
DUMMY2/p256/p256_177.wav|90|The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_331.wav|38|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_001.wav|99|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_332.wav|32|But I have been told that rugby playing numbers are up again.)
DUMMY2/p265/p265_021.wav|73|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_113.wav|20|Is that right?
DUMMY2/p363/p363_184.wav|6|I feel really confident in that department.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_017.wav|49|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_034.wav|67|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_014.wav|82|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_324.wav|25|He was then replaced by Ross.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_304.wav|31|they fail to engage.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_094.wav|3|The Festival is prepared to help.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_451.wav|106|When I was four years old I used to do like this.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_305.wav|76|SO now we know the secret.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_269.wav|24|Reaction from Scottish business leaders was mixed.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_331.wav|70|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_310.wav|57|There was some merit in that.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_165.wav|54|We have already begun to do that here.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_266.wav|56|There's not much money in cycling.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_410.wav|10|A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_059.wav|52|We just want this season to end.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_390.wav|35|That is the consistent approach of the Government.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_141.wav|54|I haven't made the donation yet.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_165.wav|100|Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_284.wav|74|The car was just there.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_262.wav|48|Stewart Ivory also declined to comment last night.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_099.wav|25|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_224.wav|5|He said the winner had been chosen by consensus.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_173.wav|2|As we worked.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_004.wav|9|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_235.wav|32|Paterson can afford to be generous.)
DUMMY2/p258/p258_030.wav|26|However, the following year the cancer returned.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_269.wav|58|I hope my successor will do the same.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_400.wav|42|She now lives in London.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_336.wav|4|Bomber was not amused.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_306.wav|64|They certainly do not socialise.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_309.wav|103|Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_342.wav|75|It was almost too much.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_387.wav|28|Art is still a risky investment.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_370.wav|36|They were to blame for the first two goals.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_372.wav|55|The European elections revealed a lack of interest and a lack of knowledge.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_125.wav|59|We want to keep the pound.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_005.wav|104|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_043.wav|26|It's a blessing.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_040.wav|45|However, the decision has been welcomed by Scottish Enterprise officials.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_287.wav|56|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_052.wav|62|We have to break that cycle.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_133.wav|50|It is a common problem.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_355.wav|103|I had some time with Aston Villa.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_223.wav|107|I had enough on.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_068.wav|72|Clearly, audiences are unsettled.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_056.wav|3|This trend is likely to strengthen.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_210.wav|36|Tommy is not a problem.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_235.wav|19|My body is exhausted.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_155.wav|89|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_301.wav|52|So what is the campaign about ?
DUMMY2/p248/p248_274.wav|99|I feel pretty good.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_108.wav|55|Scotland were on Saturday.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_240.wav|72|They also have good neighbours.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_034.wav|2|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_061.wav|64|Yesterday her family were too upset to speak.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_306.wav|39|What are they for ?
DUMMY2/p251/p251_152.wav|9|He seemed to lose his focus.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_111.wav|63|It's not a holiday time for football players.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_041.wav|16|Dancing was her life.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_012.wav|48|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_015.wav|43|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_222.wav|73|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_212.wav|22|Iain Duncan Smith is wrong.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_010.wav|18|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_301.wav|40|This is a war over our home.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_290.wav|79|In a way he was.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_116.wav|20|It's a shame.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_200.wav|102|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_196.wav|41|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_296.wav|34|I have never seen anything like it.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_094.wav|45|Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_170.wav|31|I lost my head.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_240.wav|64|We are all equal.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_400.wav|69|But, in fact, the reverse is true.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_118.wav|102|Few other services in Scotland are affected, the spokesman said.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_325.wav|40|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_233.wav|51|This fact is supported by audience research.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_357.wav|5|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_152.wav|39|We have seen a copy of the report.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_110.wav|79|Which is where we come in.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_294.wav|59|I thought it was my only chance.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_134.wav|37|The Chancellor will deal from a position of strength.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_065.wav|11|Where is the discipline?
DUMMY2/p301/p301_397.wav|91|Partition is not an option.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_388.wav|106|Six other people were injured.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_357.wav|94|Sex offender programmes to be retained by public sector.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_138.wav|23|Somehow they got out.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_303.wav|28|It is a simple equation.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_122.wav|103|David was not either.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_078.wav|4|THE pain was almost too much to bear.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_122.wav|64|A venue was found.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_223.wav|42|She failed in her action.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_267.wav|90|That's the only thing I will say.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_039.wav|47|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_263.wav|98|You can spend money on housing.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_407.wav|104|I don't think there's going to be one.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_373.wav|76|Frank Warren is a great man.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_162.wav|78|There is a lack of staff.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_269.wav|96|The government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_199.wav|19|So they will settle again.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_133.wav|81|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_065.wav|94|I've spent a lot of time on buses.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_404.wav|16|So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_296.wav|30|I've got a young family.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_381.wav|60|Other musicians were found in retirement.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_056.wav|70|Here's a clue.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_320.wav|33|He also seems to have been around forever.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_341.wav|92|The last few weeks have been really bad.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_179.wav|90|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_326.wav|1|They were at her bedside when she died.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_036.wav|21|I go in for the parts.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_334.wav|29|What form did that take ?
DUMMY2/p261/p261_278.wav|100|They are interior designers and architects.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_100.wav|53|I am delighted to hear this news.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_289.wav|63|It wasn't about one player.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_343.wav|104|There are moments of joy in politics.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_184.wav|93|What has caused the demise of singing?
DUMMY2/p311/p311_405.wav|4|It was the same old story.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_249.wav|34|People want to see me on the screen.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_290.wav|102|This is still a young team, you know.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_043.wav|2|This represents a tough game for us.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_122.wav|31|Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_032.wav|76|It was important to win the singles.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_172.wav|7|You have to ask whether they have really thought through these issues.)
DUMMY2/p318/p318_091.wav|19|It's a very, very special day.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_353.wav|40|It is not like us.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_399.wav|28|So is the rest of British sport.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_270.wav|13|She added, The sheriff was obviously frustrated.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_171.wav|45|We've made a couple of albums.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_103.wav|25|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_393.wav|85|A new school will be built.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_315.wav|36|They come to enjoy themselves.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_215.wav|36|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_166.wav|66|The first eviction takes place on Sunday.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_135.wav|81|I don't know the full story.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_197.wav|32|But he admitted he could not speak for the new owner.)
DUMMY2/p265/p265_268.wav|73|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_196.wav|21|These days are over.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_018.wav|105|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_188.wav|94|Four policemen were wounded.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_207.wav|0|Today we must not repeat that mistake.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_240.wav|96|The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_201.wav|78|We want to begin a programme in the UK.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_373.wav|0|They are used to the big stage.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_355.wav|102|I didn't even have the first idea.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_297.wav|87|We've had great things in the past.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_125.wav|91|We aim to put them out of business.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_058.wav|36|We should be able to cope.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_079.wav|91|Without approval, the sport will find it difficult to develop.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_262.wav|15|She is now planning a visit.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_357.wav|33|It's too horrible to think.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_176.wav|45|The clarity is vital.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_168.wav|7|This action reflects a slump in bookings.)
DUMMY2/p364/p364_013.wav|88|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_022.wav|102|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_278.wav|33|They have a car and cannot afford another.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_212.wav|2|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_293.wav|4|There is a solution, she believes.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_280.wav|89|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_176.wav|92|It's all about money, money, money.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_099.wav|47|It was an adventure.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_142.wav|8|There was an element of frustration.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_221.wav|28|It had not been a terribly inspiring end, either.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_184.wav|1|This is a dream come true for me.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_266.wav|14|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.)
DUMMY2/p247/p247_041.wav|14|The boy is no longer with us.)
DUMMY2/p238/p238_297.wav|37|I'm interested in interesting work.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_423.wav|16|It was little else.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_303.wav|93|He said she was mad.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_179.wav|44|One person was believed to have been hit.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_326.wav|58|Lambert will be playing against Belgium.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_178.wav|85|She hopes to study in Britain one day.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_412.wav|72|They would never let him go.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_074.wav|49|The team this year is going places.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_218.wav|14|Do I think about them often ?)
DUMMY2/p269/p269_394.wav|94|I'm pleased about one thing.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_098.wav|58|The website is now being amended.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_078.wav|47|This is the way things should be handled.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_347.wav|95|But I think it's different from the rest!
DUMMY2/p345/p345_261.wav|82|Fatherhood is important to Tony Blair.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_172.wav|100|What do we want to do that for ?
DUMMY2/p246/p246_064.wav|5|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
DUMMY2/p231/p231_269.wav|50|The property is owned by Glasgow City Council.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_319.wav|72|The teenager had been missing for six months.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_006.wav|3|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_066.wav|107|A young Briton had a lucky escape.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_298.wav|63|Further expansion has been achieved in Germany and Italy.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_377.wav|20|The task is enormous.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_143.wav|81|It is not just about pay.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_069.wav|32|Do I have a favourite ?)
DUMMY2/p239/p239_371.wav|48|He ended up a headmaster.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_031.wav|51|We are just being flooded.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_171.wav|10|We've made a couple of albums.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_253.wav|62|He leaves a beat.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_264.wav|76|We are playing them at their own game.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_053.wav|92|For sure we want to win it.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_334.wav|25|That is the very reason why it was so vital.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_297.wav|58|It is a very resilient and deadly bacterium.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_049.wav|103|They said she had been visiting her son, who is unemployed.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_242.wav|7|He must get to know himself.)
DUMMY2/p261/p261_458.wav|100|Our legal advice is clear.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_074.wav|27|It's all I can do.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_155.wav|49|I think, at last, the company will find itself again.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_002.wav|5|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_135.wav|32|I love the spectacle of cinema.)
DUMMY2/p312/p312_286.wav|62|It is all one-sided.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_293.wav|79|Well, that's all right then.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_147.wav|102|We need a new kind of theatre.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_162.wav|1|The party lasted all night.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_250.wav|68|But first it goes out on TV.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_081.wav|25|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_035.wav|68|They are interior designers and architects.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_230.wav|46|That's the National Grid.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_288.wav|5|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_330.wav|80|Work is under way to create a studio in Inverness.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_473.wav|39|My place is in the kitchen.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_252.wav|93|He got the same story.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_329.wav|19|This is the logic of punishment assaults.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_077.wav|103|I am so sorry.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_099.wav|27|It is home-grown.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_257.wav|70|There's not much money in cycling.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_199.wav|20|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_306.wav|38|I always felt they played for me.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_209.wav|67|I came home by ambulance.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_186.wav|21|If he does, he has a real chance of gold.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_042.wav|85|I accept that, but is very upsetting.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_257.wav|23|There is no dispute with the Iraqi people.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_156.wav|25|This latter point is hugely important.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_308.wav|75|I was there five months ago.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_370.wav|78|The commitment was not long, and it was worth the risk.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_367.wav|106|From there, they can go anywhere.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_134.wav|78|Three days later, he was killed.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_192.wav|36|You know the sort of thing.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_346.wav|104|Yesterday, he was busy in his office.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_249.wav|79|And that was just the start.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_067.wav|5|There could be a way back.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_137.wav|60|The only safe investment is cash.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_390.wav|21|I've done nothing wrong, and that's the truth.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_308.wav|98|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_257.wav|4|Faces from the Eighties.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_049.wav|8|My fitness was very poor.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_110.wav|82|I would probably have to agree with him.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_353.wav|8|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_160.wav|47|Does that put pressure on us?
DUMMY2/p305/p305_399.wav|54|There is too much at stake for that.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_237.wav|13|I was a little surprised.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_156.wav|59|The hotel was now for sale.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_105.wav|25|That would be unlawful.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_203.wav|36|Because he was born in England.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_236.wav|4|He gets his moment.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_029.wav|26|Because it's a waste of time for both sides.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_193.wav|3|The performance is not there.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_027.wav|63|I am pretty careful with money.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_129.wav|46|Our idea is to make it entirely Irish.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_138.wav|29|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_341.wav|3|We will deliver at director level.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_211.wav|33|But it was money well spent.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_417.wav|60|This was great for our sport.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_377.wav|102|Well, it happened to me, so it's happening to him.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_188.wav|5|It was very frightened and dirty.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_097.wav|65|Does the name matter?)
DUMMY2/p228/p228_122.wav|57|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_062.wav|93|I've had six days of rehearsal.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_397.wav|92|That is European law.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_156.wav|71|"I was in daily contact."
DUMMY2/p274/p274_022.wav|32|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. )
DUMMY2/p274/p274_427.wav|32|Such an attack is bizarre.)
DUMMY2/p317/p317_095.wav|97|However, it is much bigger than that.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_216.wav|93|His third goal was superb.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_120.wav|64|Within six minutes, they were two goals down.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_396.wav|103|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_044.wav|2|Is a drug dealer?
DUMMY2/p244/p244_062.wav|78|The company continues to grow.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_112.wav|53|What are they for ?
DUMMY2/p279/p279_025.wav|25|It's a relief that a decision has finally been made.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_150.wav|56|The Internet is no substitute for customer service.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_337.wav|57|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_323.wav|48|I won't make an official complaint.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_328.wav|102|Maybe it helps us.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_159.wav|46|I was in jail for five years.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_150.wav|8|I am delighted for everyone in Airdrie.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_217.wav|35|My life is in the ballet.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_367.wav|62|And it will be even more difficult tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_366.wav|93|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_270.wav|57|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_117.wav|33|I will be ridiculed.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_002.wav|91|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_308.wav|21|They really shouldn't have put it out.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_139.wav|47|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_032.wav|56|It carries a double message.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_115.wav|1|Seven children had lost both parents.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_349.wav|9|The commitment was not long, and it was worth the risk.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_038.wav|87|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
DUMMY2/p340/p340_140.wav|74|Don't hold your breath.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_012.wav|68|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_148.wav|71|"They did very well."
DUMMY2/p237/p237_310.wav|61|This is a war over our home.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_398.wav|64|Anyway, she is playing a lesbian.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_363.wav|96|But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_328.wav|24|I thought his speech was a disgrace.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_478.wav|48|The criminal justice system doesn't deliver.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_210.wav|65|He suffered severe head injuries.)
DUMMY2/p226/p226_031.wav|43|This is the window.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_100.wav|69|I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_268.wav|84|Blood samples were taken.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_287.wav|39|An announcement will follow in due course.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_043.wav|47|But it might have done.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_292.wav|48|They will probably come back.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_208.wav|23|His conclusion is upbeat.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_099.wav|82|It has to work.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_067.wav|70|And if he hadn't become a musician?
DUMMY2/p239/p239_225.wav|48|Finding suitable replacements would not be easy.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_020.wav|94|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_490.wav|75|I had it before the final.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_097.wav|8|But the battle has only just begun.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_261.wav|18|Nobody has been put on trial.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_286.wav|61|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_221.wav|42|And we know that, because we know the hairdresser.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_073.wav|106|The Government does not go far enough.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_132.wav|72|Have you noticed?
DUMMY2/p347/p347_203.wav|46|But you can go beyond that condition.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_245.wav|14|Those overseas offices were great.)
DUMMY2/p259/p259_059.wav|7|He also has a Scottish grandfather.)
DUMMY2/p284/p284_116.wav|16|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_404.wav|72|We expect a full house on the night.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_305.wav|12|People can get them if they want.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_372.wav|1|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_272.wav|23|They were not doing it too well, either.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_255.wav|11|There is great potential on this river.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_076.wav|100|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_165.wav|40|Well, he should know.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_376.wav|24|The salary changes are long overdue.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_340.wav|99|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_023.wav|41|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_261.wav|24|He was good, but not that good.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_332.wav|62|We do things in an appropriate way.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_048.wav|80|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_204.wav|64|It is legally binding.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_362.wav|34|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_100.wav|103|There are lots of these women in Finland.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_411.wav|87|The capital costs are modest.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_190.wav|24|The new scheme will have its own terms and conditions.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_014.wav|44|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_253.wav|16|We have to expand.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_211.wav|8|I am very realistic about these things.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_322.wav|89|The same things will happen with GM foods.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_160.wav|66|You shouldn't have a stoppage in November.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_257.wav|35|Nato was not a love affair.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_236.wav|68|We're still talking with a few people.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_415.wav|78|Overall, the labour market continued to tighten.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_299.wav|4|They're not always the same person.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_421.wav|1|We will do so again.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_140.wav|100|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_066.wav|74|It's a lovely, lovely film.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_223.wav|12|She didn't tell us anything new.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_171.wav|25|My life has been destroyed.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_057.wav|73|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_190.wav|93|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_120.wav|25|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_162.wav|61|It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_182.wav|13|We will reform the welfare state.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_010.wav|10|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_109.wav|47|We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_389.wav|103|Which brings us to the Scottish connection.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_212.wav|18|If that's the case, he will struggle.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_366.wav|98|Who wouldn't do it?
DUMMY2/p232/p232_009.wav|96|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_271.wav|92|We're playing away from home and that's it.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_043.wav|80|The boy is no longer with us.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_309.wav|41|My body is clearly capable.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_226.wav|97|Clubs can only do so much.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_288.wav|3|What form did that take ?
DUMMY2/p330/p330_238.wav|1|We have great team spirit.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_014.wav|104|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_357.wav|62|It's better to be happy.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_460.wav|24|It was like someone had died.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_240.wav|13|Nothing can bring back their son.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_254.wav|51|A friendship that will endure.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_348.wav|51|For me, it was a shattering experience.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_284.wav|102|We said, What do you mean?
DUMMY2/p270/p270_340.wav|8|It looks as though the issue with The Scotsman is too sensitive.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_393.wav|89|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_150.wav|98|It's good for the city.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_367.wav|91|Stock markets will be watching closely.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_299.wav|99|SCOTLAND has shown the way.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_227.wav|19|That figure will always remain with me.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_245.wav|82|This is wonderful news.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_324.wav|77|Leading share prices have also fallen in Paris and Frankfurt.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_255.wav|53|Edinburgh Prison will also require to be seen.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_052.wav|6|But real life is not like that.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_142.wav|31|Wallace was a prisoner of war.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_213.wav|9|Now, it's all right.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_061.wav|102|It's all too short term.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_142.wav|22|We are both very confused and extremely angry.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_325.wav|61|We are very strongly behind the bid.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_099.wav|2|No, the equipment is extra.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_351.wav|60|The most important thing was to win today.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_049.wav|99|The record companies have gone through the floor.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_348.wav|50|Are they free ?
DUMMY2/p326/p326_019.wav|28|Since then physicists have found it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_231.wav|17|He must not be removed from office.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_104.wav|59|I'm delighted about that.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_318.wav|24|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_019.wav|44|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_287.wav|11|It is something that we will put right.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_173.wav|93|The hotel was now for sale.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_119.wav|29|We did what we had to do.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_240.wav|20|The scene is about this?
DUMMY2/p298/p298_109.wav|68|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_178.wav|106|Advice and counselling will be offered.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_012.wav|104|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_395.wav|58|She can't say where she was, what she did.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_116.wav|68|Lately, that market has come under pressure.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_184.wav|102|We believe a third party was involved.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_399.wav|18|It is about more than Scotland.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_028.wav|94|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_182.wav|35|I have spoken to head office.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_067.wav|48|Everyone could see the joke.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_076.wav|88|You see - this business is a good one.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_334.wav|72|They were unable to revive him.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_009.wav|78|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_207.wav|13|She was close to suicide at one stage.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_184.wav|70|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_147.wav|90|The home side didn't stand a chance.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_157.wav|33|If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_177.wav|49|Teams are always interesting to watch.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_410.wav|85|We should keep this recent assault in perspective.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_218.wav|58|We are now up against it.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_003.wav|83|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_360.wav|45|It was one in the afternoon.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_111.wav|104|We have great confidence in Derek.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_327.wav|0|You are looking at him.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_270.wav|2|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_148.wav|0|There was a definite prejudice.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_411.wav|22|Still, the experience was amazing, she says.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_400.wav|29|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
DUMMY2/p326/p326_272.wav|28|Three bystanders were killed.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_262.wav|34|I've got to provide for my family.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_111.wav|37|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_015.wav|106|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_201.wav|25|Tommy is not a problem.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_236.wav|92|I feel sorry for anyone coming in here.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_345.wav|10|The advisers had some discussions, but no conclusion was reached.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_024.wav|83|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_174.wav|36|Do not imagine for a moment that they are not there.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_386.wav|53|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
DUMMY2/p297/p297_254.wav|42|Who did the recruiting?
DUMMY2/p336/p336_116.wav|98|They never got into the show this time.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_363.wav|55|That seems highly unlikely.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_350.wav|85|She is also claiming constructive and unfair dismissal.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_300.wav|66|It's a source of deep concern.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_319.wav|50|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_250.wav|67|It's only fair.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_262.wav|96|It does not appear at this stage that alcohol was a factor.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_364.wav|7|It's too horrible to think.)
DUMMY2/p317/p317_171.wav|97|This is excellent value for money.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_292.wav|47|Who can predict?
DUMMY2/p300/p300_308.wav|102|He is a law unto himself.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_048.wav|86|He is too weak to move.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_350.wav|95|They come to enjoy themselves.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_025.wav|74|It would be nice.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_251.wav|98|The family baton is handed on.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_052.wav|67|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_351.wav|36|It's a policy which has worked for us.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_282.wav|5|If not, he should go home.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_137.wav|35|These men are a part of India.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_420.wav|85|They responded in the most positive way.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_121.wav|10|The hearing was due to continue today.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_012.wav|74|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_120.wav|59|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_200.wav|3|At the top level, the salaries are far too high.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_333.wav|82|I might get an injury very easily.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_161.wav|47|Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_052.wav|15|Hasn't let anyone down?
DUMMY2/p330/p330_243.wav|1|We have a lot of sympathy for applicants.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_013.wav|23|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_162.wav|72|It may be that lifestyle is behind it.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_374.wav|35|She is now on the back benches.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_210.wav|21|I did not understand the dynamics of Scotland.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_105.wav|46|That's why he visited.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_148.wav|18|Sadly, he has a point.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_177.wav|4|What kind of festival is proposed?
DUMMY2/p225/p225_010.wav|101|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_089.wav|76|This gives us a lot of practice.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_121.wav|88|It is part of their job.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_138.wav|107|Racism is alive and kicking in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_128.wav|61|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_136.wav|13|We cannot lose it.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_190.wav|100|DAVID Sutherland does not beat about the bush.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_372.wav|99|Colour was at the core of his life.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_262.wav|62|That would be a big mistake.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_310.wav|89|It is a private matter between the firm and our staff.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_143.wav|57|Nobody in the world can get away from him.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_368.wav|69|He was the architect.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_173.wav|57|We have to sort it out ourselves.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_321.wav|43|My body is clearly capable.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_053.wav|26|That is very hard, alone.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_254.wav|94|Her presence was almost everywhere.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_218.wav|28|They finished second and third.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_235.wav|77|I was ready for this.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_184.wav|48|Structural changes were also required.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_176.wav|107|It should have a health warning - it is addictive.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_459.wav|14|The damage is all inside.)
DUMMY2/p233/p233_365.wav|84|But I managed.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_025.wav|42|But it's been kept to a minimum.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_118.wav|56|That is far too high.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_271.wav|45|Lottery money was intended to be used for good causes.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_047.wav|15|I am so upset.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_410.wav|34|Millions of British jobs depend on Europe.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_114.wav|19|I was very fortunate.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_142.wav|84|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_149.wav|94|We just had a go.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_349.wav|104|I'm not going to change from it.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_482.wav|65|I'd like my TV programmes to be simple, but not too simple.)
DUMMY2/p305/p305_370.wav|54|There has been a big change in defence.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_143.wav|86|Is that Titanic?
DUMMY2/p301/p301_286.wav|91|The board would report to the Scottish Parliament.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_326.wav|38|The law should be changed.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_342.wav|47|These days are long gone.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_101.wav|71|"Oil embargo endorsed."
DUMMY2/p252/p252_152.wav|55|Does the name matter ?
DUMMY2/p317/p317_103.wav|97|I drove the ball well.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_321.wav|68|It's been very exciting, very challenging, and a privilege.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_279.wav|11|It was the first time they met.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_229.wav|79|I just want him to win a tournament.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_078.wav|52|The key to the whole project will be environmental concern.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_103.wav|38|We should just say no.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_162.wav|55|Parents of pupils at the school have also expressed concern.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_115.wav|18|Today is a victory for the Scottish Parliament.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_099.wav|84|That is the fact of the matter.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_352.wav|29|There was no time scale.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_258.wav|75|He was good, but not that good.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_336.wav|52|I hope numbers will be up on last time.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_030.wav|39|We would like to find another region to develop in England.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_301.wav|31|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_294.wav|81|The goals will come.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_376.wav|1|They were very, very anxious and nervous about their personal safety.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_157.wav|31|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_089.wav|78|Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_092.wav|84|They have a further report to make in March.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_071.wav|77|It looks like a hit.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_189.wav|67|The hotel was now for sale.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_309.wav|26|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_304.wav|39|In the end, it was no choice.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_046.wav|33|What did you learn in school today?
DUMMY2/p295/p295_164.wav|92|The voters are our masters.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_329.wav|84|He told the court.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_002.wav|95|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_056.wav|49|I don't want to hear any excuses.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_366.wav|85|Many of them were his friends and colleagues.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_181.wav|18|Within three days he was dead.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_195.wav|67|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_197.wav|70|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_057.wav|46|It will come up here.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_359.wav|96|She is free.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_292.wav|32|Frankly, we should all have such problems.)
DUMMY2/p281/p281_329.wav|36|There is no shortage of farmers.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_455.wav|75|He deserved a red card.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_214.wav|63|It comes from reflection or thinking.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_272.wav|40|His place in central defence was taken by John Anderson.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_247.wav|79|But those days are dead and gone.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_366.wav|9|However, it was well worth the wait.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_005.wav|6|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_296.wav|41|Who can predict?
DUMMY2/p281/p281_099.wav|36|This is a national crisis.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_067.wav|4|He is a visionary.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_255.wav|27|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_485.wav|75|It happens on an annual basis.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_293.wav|80|Sunday's game was not a trial.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_214.wav|86|It's been a good year.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_330.wav|38|Lara is very, very much a girl.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_262.wav|41|He thought he had a month to cross the street.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_202.wav|72|That is no use.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_032.wav|61|There's a story, too.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_235.wav|28|The Government faces a moral dilemma.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_351.wav|46|So now you know.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_151.wav|82|It was even worse than at home.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_317.wav|90|She is very distinctive.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_182.wav|11|He had planned to sell it.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_090.wav|48|What do they want us to do ?
DUMMY2/p317/p317_008.wav|97|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_473.wav|65|It's a tough old job to get for your first job.)
DUMMY2/p300/p300_155.wav|102|You've seen the polls then, Sean.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_437.wav|32|The Festival is prepared to help.)
DUMMY2/p246/p246_232.wav|5|Of course I was tempted.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_372.wav|21|And if he hasn't become a musician?
DUMMY2/p283/p283_020.wav|95|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_212.wav|43|They like being on the front pages of the newspapers.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_302.wav|27|There is no openness.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_287.wav|21|I believe in debate and dialogue.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_040.wav|4|We cannot go on in this fashion.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_110.wav|88|We could do a lot worse.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_034.wav|25|Horses are drawn by ballot.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_009.wav|25|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_162.wav|85|Either way, it doesn't bother me.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_248.wav|7|His background is firmly in venture capital.)
DUMMY2/p261/p261_125.wav|100|If not, a deal could take many months.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_203.wav|62|That, he claimed, was essential.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_367.wav|107|It is normal for me.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_119.wav|0|I am the Son of Sam.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_236.wav|7|My daughter is an adult.)
DUMMY2/p297/p297_143.wav|42|We believe that the reason is poverty.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_159.wav|82|However, he did not stay there very long.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_204.wav|7|It's very difficult to find a buyer.)
DUMMY2/p229/p229_081.wav|67|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_193.wav|32|We represent a wide range of society.)
DUMMY2/p269/p269_073.wav|94|I was as strong as a horse.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_291.wav|48|Even if they come out playing a physical game, we can cope.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_392.wav|51|We've been treated with complete contempt.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_371.wav|46|They should feel ashamed.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_263.wav|90|The pensioners did not want to know.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_005.wav|106|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_127.wav|42|Lockerbie has been a terrible disaster for everyone.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_280.wav|40|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_018.wav|31|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_386.wav|51|I can't believe what has happened.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_401.wav|35|You will not feel a thing.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_086.wav|49|Hopefully, it will pay off for me.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_131.wav|55|Britain's role was to stop it.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_252.wav|97|You are not going in blind.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_301.wav|0|That is the general feeling.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_031.wav|2|There's a story, too.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_270.wav|44|His treatment has been quite atrocious.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_379.wav|18|It decided to blame the media.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_024.wav|89|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_399.wav|62|Clearly, the future remains uncertain.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_262.wav|79|It's been very difficult.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_293.wav|63|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_055.wav|5|It is unique.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_020.wav|68|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_239.wav|67|You should always be able to get out in some direction.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_383.wav|8|They were to blame for the first two goals.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_307.wav|25|It was entirely justified.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_160.wav|45|They are not advertised.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_216.wav|49|Those who are unwilling or unable to improve.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_335.wav|97|It's not that difficult, it really isn't.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_207.wav|40|I don't want to use it.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_103.wav|2|She reflects a bit.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_019.wav|56|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_249.wav|68|We can just get on with our game.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_110.wav|43|Before the game we went for a pint.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_221.wav|25|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_155.wav|45|A new season has offered a fresh start for both men.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_150.wav|68|It was fit for royalty.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_455.wav|95|They had learned from the lessons of the first game.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_085.wav|91|I knew he would play two weeks ago.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_178.wav|21|I am looking forward to this film.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_062.wav|98|It was a crucial moment.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_267.wav|66|She became very good at it.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_271.wav|16|They seem to get away with it.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_404.wav|106|Has the conflict started ?
DUMMY2/p227/p227_006.wav|29|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_132.wav|65|This commitment should be built upon.)
DUMMY2/p330/p330_135.wav|1|The reason, of course, was Iraq.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_101.wav|33|In part that reflected the times.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_041.wav|105|A neighbour said.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_082.wav|52|It's been a great evening for us.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_112.wav|33|It's all about money, money, money.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_373.wav|60|Or is it?
DUMMY2/p334/p334_344.wav|38|He loved his children.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_145.wav|99|There is a lack of chemistry.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_324.wav|5|Either team will be hard.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_278.wav|22|That doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_239.wav|1|Above all the aggression must be stopped.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_350.wav|94|It is a sign of hope.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_421.wav|89|We just got a phone call on Saturday night.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_283.wav|66|Are you in this movie?
DUMMY2/p264/p264_479.wav|65|We were given a break.)
DUMMY2/p306/p306_111.wav|12|I'm not a diva.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_212.wav|91|Iain Duncan Smith is wrong.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_165.wav|78|This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_221.wav|33|We just want them home.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_027.wav|29|I feel I did not have enough time.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_321.wav|84|It shows a great deal to come back under that mental pressure.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_330.wav|60|I have no idea.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_286.wav|33|That was not the norm.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_383.wav|40|It's like a basketball.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_048.wav|36|That was the theory, anyway.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_086.wav|20|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_333.wav|73|The pair are very much in love.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_222.wav|59|We were a load of rubbish.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_073.wav|35|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
DUMMY2/p277/p277_354.wav|89|Not so, it seems.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_021.wav|58|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_144.wav|61|It seems so long since I did the exams.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_211.wav|62|It felt like my support system was leaving.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_024.wav|3|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_180.wav|62|I think it can count against you now.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_040.wav|27|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_410.wav|49|Courtenay took over on tour.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_165.wav|45|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_035.wav|102|Someone came down and said, Can you read a script?
DUMMY2/p245/p245_258.wav|59|I would have the hammer in the crowd.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_007.wav|36|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_214.wav|12|David Murray, the Rangers chairman, also welcomed the scheme.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_075.wav|52|I was returning a message he left on my mobile phone yesterday.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_020.wav|11|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_129.wav|37|They lived for their children.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_400.wav|32|It has only been rumours.)
DUMMY2/p225/p225_115.wav|101|Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_319.wav|17|The campaign was raucous.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_122.wav|62|This latter suggestion is very important.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_218.wav|30|They could go no further forward.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_068.wav|103|You are going to Glasgow Airport, and not coming back.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_195.wav|36|And this game is all about belief.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_081.wav|84|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_136.wav|1|It will be very useful for us.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_075.wav|83|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_157.wav|76|I'm not blaming audiences.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_170.wav|24|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_059.wav|84|There was no safety net.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_097.wav|69|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_026.wav|39|How are you, sir ?
DUMMY2/p247/p247_451.wav|14|But you can go beyond that condition.)
DUMMY2/p339/p339_275.wav|18|This time it really could happen.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_255.wav|37|Is it in the right place ?
DUMMY2/p243/p243_264.wav|53|The two companies were not for sale.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_388.wav|105|You ask the question.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_264.wav|107|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_163.wav|40|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_191.wav|6|That is European law.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_043.wav|107|Theatre is not a museum.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_040.wav|7|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.)
DUMMY2/p360/p360_193.wav|60|There are some good people in there.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_282.wav|21|Everything is so new.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_029.wav|21|It is a crucial award.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_208.wav|4|Everything in the symphony is there.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_044.wav|107|Subs not used, McCulloch.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_146.wav|79|I want my mum.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_079.wav|39|So what is the campaign about ?
DUMMY2/p271/p271_066.wav|27|They are real.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_103.wav|40|Now, though, he believes that the new formation has helped him form.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_320.wav|103|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_229.wav|24|It had all been arranged.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_251.wav|12|I am totally horrified by the sentence.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_153.wav|56|The long-term trend is certainly moving towards a balance.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_174.wav|91|What, then, is the real thing?
DUMMY2/p238/p238_162.wav|37|The milk industry is in turmoil.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_451.wav|39|It is a tough game but we have a chance.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_086.wav|78|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_102.wav|64|We all thought we were going to die.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_266.wav|42|England against France is always a big game.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_271.wav|57|It's a way of life.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_052.wav|56|Do I have a favourite ?
DUMMY2/p329/p329_067.wav|103|The Commons is too outdated.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_407.wav|34|The early evidence suggests he did not.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_069.wav|11|It's going to be epic.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_343.wav|48|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_234.wav|24|I am considered a teenager.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_402.wav|19|This fight is not going to go away.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_338.wav|70|Another case of foot-and-mouth disease was confirmed in Scotland yesterday.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_014.wav|32|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. )
DUMMY2/p274/p274_183.wav|32|They bought the property four years ago.)
DUMMY2/p362/p362_172.wav|15|That is for certain.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_442.wav|65|WE all watch the same match.)
DUMMY2/p318/p318_196.wav|19|After that, though, we are still waiting to see.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_080.wav|66|He released a half-dozen solo albums.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_400.wav|64|Which means it matters.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_074.wav|13|We could easily have lost that game.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_034.wav|40|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_139.wav|35|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_151.wav|94|We have seen a copy of the report.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_149.wav|27|Note the date.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_165.wav|57|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_125.wav|22|We aim to put them out of business.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_370.wav|107|I am content with the silver.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_027.wav|23|It is not true to Hollywood, nor The Player.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_236.wav|55|There is a good reason for this.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_420.wav|51|My thoughts are with their families.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_288.wav|107|Then came the collision with Sergio.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_250.wav|0|It seems a waste of talents.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_185.wav|17|There was even a joke.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_409.wav|6|I'd love the chance to play for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_342.wav|65|An opera company needs to have its orchestra.)
DUMMY2/p247/p247_066.wav|14|We could soon be in that same position!)
DUMMY2/p360/p360_360.wav|60|There was no-one of the required standard.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_082.wav|57|Today she has been released.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_202.wav|55|Do I think about them often ?
DUMMY2/p239/p239_005.wav|48|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_342.wav|1|It is like being a qualifier again.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_103.wav|72|He will suspend it on Thursday afternoon.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_241.wav|97|Surely the panel was interested?
DUMMY2/p316/p316_010.wav|85|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_305.wav|25|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_053.wav|58|Ministers are not involved in these discussions.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_374.wav|13|As two candidates are proposed, a vote is taken.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_178.wav|1|The League of Nations was also his idea.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_189.wav|75|Tomorrow is a new day.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_014.wav|92|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_386.wav|26|That team is due to be announced this morning.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_231.wav|14|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.)
DUMMY2/p330/p330_423.wav|1|I have no problem with that.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_221.wav|90|We will be victorious.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_071.wav|21|We played too deeply.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_145.wav|25|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_013.wav|94|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_289.wav|105|However, the snow was welcomed by some.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_103.wav|48|We have a major concern about enforcement action.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_334.wav|31|Work is under way to create a studio in Inverness.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_177.wav|94|His team management was protective.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_138.wav|42|It was better than a soap opera.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_018.wav|66|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_169.wav|69|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_190.wav|25|My main concern is that public health is not put at risk.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_364.wav|87|This would include the GM food industry.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_051.wav|83|It is bizarre.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_462.wav|65|They're interested only in profits.)
DUMMY2/p294/p294_089.wav|104|Seven British members of the club are missing.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_289.wav|71|"Sunday's game was not a trial."
DUMMY2/p225/p225_108.wav|101|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_213.wav|4|It had to be more flexible.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_163.wav|61|We are now up against it.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_361.wav|52|The institute board will take the decision.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_209.wav|50|We are a new department.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_293.wav|93|It was a virus.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_112.wav|94|It was the eighties.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_258.wav|69|Immediate action must be taken.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_140.wav|102|All manner of precaution and protection are taken.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_388.wav|56|We operate as a Scottish company.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_203.wav|55|Is it in the right place ?
DUMMY2/p336/p336_048.wav|98|The crowd was waiting.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_052.wav|33|I won't go back.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_394.wav|58|If there is default.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_305.wav|97|It could have been just a quick fix.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_134.wav|34|It was no more than they deserved.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_047.wav|24|So is that it, then ?
DUMMY2/p262/p262_048.wav|45|They had to explain it.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_184.wav|37|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_323.wav|75|A lot has been written.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_099.wav|57|It is annoying.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_292.wav|104|This could also affect the sentencing.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_269.wav|73|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_183.wav|48|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_236.wav|57|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_397.wav|98|She is having an affair with his partner.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_350.wav|15|And that is our first victory in Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_416.wav|38|A great deal has been achieved.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_145.wav|96|We want to see the maximum of change.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_374.wav|41|It became a national network.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_179.wav|47|It's a joke.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_100.wav|40|There were no grounds for his action.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_121.wav|95|Our house was very small.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_137.wav|14|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.)
DUMMY2/p244/p244_260.wav|78|That is not the case in Europe.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_187.wav|93|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_194.wav|88|And there are different perspectives.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_107.wav|104|I've never felt affection for Emu.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_038.wav|40|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_046.wav|49|Rangers deserved to beat us.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_300.wav|55|Stephen had never considered the question of compensation.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_387.wav|78|He will be difficult to replace.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_095.wav|18|It is hard to understand.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_176.wav|86|He asked me in a tolerance zone.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_155.wav|59|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_138.wav|27|He should resign.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_353.wav|44|This represents a tough game for us.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_156.wav|79|The driver just insulted me.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_054.wav|33|We could not compete with Rangers.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_354.wav|81|I HAVE a dream.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_077.wav|34|I saw the explosion and panicked.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_012.wav|12|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_074.wav|91|The next thing will be cutting journey times.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_369.wav|53|We have a substantial value of assets on the ground.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_166.wav|42|He died from multiple injuries.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_028.wav|80|They should be so lucky.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_057.wav|17|All of us know it exists.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_007.wav|1|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_086.wav|55|I can't remember a lot about the accident.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_096.wav|47|It was a good performance.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_212.wav|71|"His death was a tragic accident."
DUMMY2/p246/p246_327.wav|5|Is that an issue?
DUMMY2/p255/p255_115.wav|31|I joined a group.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_145.wav|83|I was awful.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_132.wav|25|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_353.wav|43|A report is the first step in a criminal case in India.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_219.wav|53|Scotland will not vote for New Labour next time.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_007.wav|31|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_273.wav|3|Clearly, the stakes are high.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_372.wav|76|This was not a summit about the euro.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_050.wav|97|He did the right thing by ignoring me.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_410.wav|32|I've had a wonderful career.)
DUMMY2/p317/p317_258.wav|97|Blair also faces pressure from within the cabinet.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_193.wav|90|I grew up listening to these people.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_325.wav|51|Dialogue is the key.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_340.wav|64|The stadium was full.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_242.wav|93|He was good, but not that good.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_199.wav|77|The sanctions are about collective punishment.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_049.wav|79|I am the fastest player on the course.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_316.wav|69|Off with their heads.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_150.wav|15|Feel the air, the space.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_284.wav|61|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_323.wav|92|It succeeds in a direct and convincing manner.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_168.wav|88|One-third of the places are already taken.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_209.wav|30|There is a great potential on this river.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_162.wav|45|However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_179.wav|83|The goals were good.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_021.wav|72|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_203.wav|18|Look at New Labour, it hasn't worked.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_333.wav|75|You may have a short memory.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_302.wav|87|This youngster is so exciting!
DUMMY2/p257/p257_054.wav|105|We were surprised to see the photograph.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_134.wav|96|You've got to be vigilant.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_212.wav|75|They have the cash and the fire power.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_185.wav|96|Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_359.wav|58|Yet he left a few days later.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_187.wav|70|Our team is just so young.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_254.wav|97|He must have sat down, relieved it was over.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_395.wav|22|We have been working closely with Holyrood.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_253.wav|25|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_074.wav|78|Only water is currently allowed.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_095.wav|86|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_210.wav|17|One must hope not!
DUMMY2/p267/p267_388.wav|0|The results will take second place.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_380.wav|74|They are expected to be released today.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_424.wav|74|Things were not easy from the outset.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_360.wav|100|It's too horrible to think.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_172.wav|6|The German had a point to make.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_266.wav|53|The full Cabinet will meet today to discuss the oil crisis.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_184.wav|35|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_353.wav|3|They have to be addressed.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_424.wav|20|I chose to make a film.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_256.wav|88|The real issue is personal.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_184.wav|87|His job was not advertised.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_401.wav|100|The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_225.wav|22|I, like many others, will consider where we go from here.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_205.wav|70|We have an election in eight days.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_161.wav|55|I told them during their morning break.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_068.wav|96|It is like a river running by my home.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_233.wav|78|There is a lot of concern.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_022.wav|106|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_226.wav|50|This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_221.wav|52|We hope for a fresh board with a fresh, clear look at things.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_042.wav|107|We are looking for volunteers.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_208.wav|8|Stephen has never considered the question of compensation.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_150.wav|95|I'm sure this game will be equally successful.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_095.wav|49|These guys will not lie down.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_375.wav|19|That was never their agenda.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_193.wav|59|Feel the heat?
DUMMY2/p273/p273_245.wav|56|What are you not good at ?
DUMMY2/p307/p307_210.wav|22|They always want to give a performance.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_338.wav|87|The business has expanded rapidly, however.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_028.wav|25|They should be so lucky.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_137.wav|5|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_066.wav|88|He leaves a beat.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_195.wav|23|We will do so again.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_448.wav|63|The couple had one daughter.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_322.wav|75|I can live with it.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_220.wav|106|I think, therefore I am ?
DUMMY2/p376/p376_260.wav|71|"He was popular."
DUMMY2/p262/p262_306.wav|45|One was a lawyer.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_116.wav|14|We deserve a significant rise.)
DUMMY2/p268/p268_185.wav|87|The culture is extremely widespread and vibrant.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_335.wav|94|They had a confession.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_253.wav|107|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_113.wav|106|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_088.wav|102|They had to be cut from the wreckage.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_295.wav|72|But it could have been written for her.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_111.wav|21|But we can't have a casino.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_078.wav|107|I cannot believe she has been admonished.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_405.wav|7|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.)
DUMMY2/p280/p280_239.wav|52|Jim was down there with his wife.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_006.wav|37|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_455.wav|39|However, one has arrived in the post.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_257.wav|79|I thought they were just excited.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_152.wav|77|You had to go and see him.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_098.wav|73|She reflects a bit.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_268.wav|48|They made such decisions in London.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_031.wav|96|It's a matter of balance.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_396.wav|27|It will take place in July.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_353.wav|38|What would you do if you didn't work?
DUMMY2/p283/p283_295.wav|95|We accept the new rules.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_287.wav|86|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_206.wav|102|It is turning that way all across Europe.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_172.wav|49|That's when you hope to take advantage.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_280.wav|6|The gap is closing.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_332.wav|36|But the Farmer is bemused.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_001.wav|98|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_136.wav|31|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_207.wav|35|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_184.wav|60|I did not see anything to begin with.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_141.wav|21|We are very hopeful he will be cleared.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_124.wav|95|Our idea is to share and lower the cost.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_152.wav|101|The weather forecast isn't good.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_086.wav|92|There is a contract in existence for Allan.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_259.wav|60|It makes me feel difficult.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_388.wav|51|You do that because you want to win.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_047.wav|103|The bill would be massive.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_105.wav|107|It separates the men from the boys.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_066.wav|20|He was at home with his pals.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_373.wav|63|Neither woman has been named.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_465.wav|7|But we have built a platform for next season.)
DUMMY2/p280/p280_131.wav|52|He's got to look after himself now.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_034.wav|71|"It's a matter of balance."
DUMMY2/p236/p236_395.wav|75|I should think so, too.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_385.wav|102|That's the kind of thing that counts.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_171.wav|93|It's quite a routine.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_211.wav|47|In each case they were a goal down.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_022.wav|77|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_215.wav|34|Is being naturally funny enough?
DUMMY2/p298/p298_033.wav|68|I think they should have more respect.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_049.wav|29|I expect a rapid response.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_021.wav|83|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_350.wav|61|The composer will conduct.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_077.wav|10|We have to offer value for money.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_159.wav|5|I will tell you.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_210.wav|103|What did they think of her voice?
DUMMY2/p314/p314_151.wav|51|Don't even bother applying.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_194.wav|82|That's when you hope to take advantage.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_213.wav|71|"On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football."
DUMMY2/p323/p323_163.wav|34|It didn't work against Sweden, but that was the intention.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_255.wav|61|We have spent the last couple of years with acting directors.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_068.wav|11|This time it is official.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_051.wav|24|Strikers like to go to the ground.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_301.wav|67|I thought it was my only chance.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_035.wav|7|Because he was born in England.)
DUMMY2/p278/p278_017.wav|10|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_141.wav|0|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_322.wav|43|Referees are easy targets.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_041.wav|97|Overall, however, these were also down.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_045.wav|88|And that's the trouble with this business.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_124.wav|51|There are a lot of examples.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_310.wav|20|The plot is minimal.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_003.wav|28|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_016.wav|99|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_101.wav|96|They were outside the circle.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_088.wav|43|Detection is often difficult.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_264.wav|70|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_189.wav|30|People buy everything with cash.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_077.wav|48|He phoned the number in the brochure.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_359.wav|43|He's very explosive.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_333.wav|94|The problems began a long time ago.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_245.wav|84|I know I'm in a very special position.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_322.wav|11|It may now be too expensive for anyone.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_261.wav|19|He was in contention almost every week.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_242.wav|28|The vacancies are in support services and arts.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_083.wav|9|Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_295.wav|1|There were no formal announcements.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_260.wav|30|I started on a fire a couple of times.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_154.wav|103|The whole experience has left me bitter.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_405.wav|11|They have not given them the evidence.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_237.wav|48|Jackie is passionate about Scotland.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_193.wav|36|They were seriously after him.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_006.wav|78|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_129.wav|41|It is a job creation scheme.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_394.wav|8|It runs until the beginning of June.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_204.wav|14|They have the cash and the fire power.)
DUMMY2/p251/p251_120.wav|9|We work on the same level.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_108.wav|41|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_068.wav|63|Robin Williams is very subdued.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_331.wav|105|Alex Ferguson is the same.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_016.wav|100|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_070.wav|95|The Government should be ashamed.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_076.wav|80|The play is based on a real-life event.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_094.wav|23|We've been overwhelmed by the response.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_098.wav|12|There are a huge number of arts.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_059.wav|65|Why do it otherwise?)
DUMMY2/p269/p269_264.wav|94|It is also very valuable.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_181.wav|76|I hope we do.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_124.wav|8|I've never seen a game like it.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_197.wav|68|They were very, very anxious and nervous about their personal safety.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_156.wav|24|Was it the wife ?
DUMMY2/p339/p339_174.wav|18|I'm so worried about the roads.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_349.wav|48|This is the version which appeared in our paper.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_050.wav|55|The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_254.wav|44|I learned a lot from her.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_125.wav|0|They could use a boost.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_207.wav|104|It will take some time to establish.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_116.wav|13|At the moment, the success in Germany is good.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_268.wav|20|The system can work.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_122.wav|73|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_092.wav|50|Their attitude is all wrong.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_337.wav|77|My whole life has changed.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_203.wav|53|Full details are expected to be released in June.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_294.wav|100|It was an easy decision to come here.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_005.wav|14|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. )
DUMMY2/p308/p308_337.wav|107|There was no hint of bravado.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_393.wav|47|It is not normal practice.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_079.wav|103|It is a pity, but you can't have everything.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_278.wav|57|All options are open.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_153.wav|72|You need a trademark.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_113.wav|26|I joined a group.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_033.wav|57|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_338.wav|16|Finally, he paid for the movie.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_103.wav|90|The court heard he drove into the path of a car.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_139.wav|26|Is that Titanic?
DUMMY2/p306/p306_266.wav|12|His expulsion would not solve the problem.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_159.wav|91|The death toll included five children.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_110.wav|59|We work on the same level.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_039.wav|102|A further police inquiry is currently being held.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_026.wav|71|"But it failed."
DUMMY2/p340/p340_072.wav|74|However, that is just for starters.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_086.wav|47|By then, he was walking on water.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_244.wav|94|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_298.wav|96|He should have won.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_007.wav|91|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_449.wav|36|She came to the Highland Show.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_127.wav|81|The people will come.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_234.wav|86|We have a free vote on these things in our party.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_102.wav|58|This is thought to mean sometime next week.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_259.wav|3|It was a great experience.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_205.wav|24|We've had an enjoyable adventure.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_279.wav|2|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_100.wav|57|We could not get any possession.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_075.wav|63|It is a job creation scheme.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_299.wav|7|There's not much money in cycling.)
DUMMY2/p294/p294_211.wav|104|I love this job.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_197.wav|11|Perhaps it is jealousy.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_355.wav|91|That only came out during a radio interview.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_235.wav|38|It's good fun, and makes it so much more interesting.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_228.wav|65|He talks too much.)
DUMMY2/p280/p280_030.wav|52|She brought a lot to my life.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_271.wav|3|Well, it was certainly different.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_090.wav|100|However, on this showing it's going to be a difficult task.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_008.wav|66|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_250.wav|39|What was the matter for concern ?
DUMMY2/p298/p298_312.wav|68|We have the location, which is assured.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_372.wav|53|He really played us into a corner.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_277.wav|44|Last year, however, was a different story.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_144.wav|48|The tribunal said his conduct was wholly reprehensible.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_250.wav|87|They should stop the bombing.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_348.wav|6|The world is being invited to visit.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_221.wav|69|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_102.wav|7|The selection process is still at a very early stage.)
DUMMY2/p253/p253_237.wav|70|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_271.wav|23|I was furious about it.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_368.wav|95|I have a moral dilemma.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_151.wav|77|The pension levels will remain the same.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_283.wav|35|was everything done to save people ?
DUMMY2/p231/p231_114.wav|50|Maybe this battle has been.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_047.wav|10|So is that it, then ?
DUMMY2/p255/p255_317.wav|31|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_236.wav|78|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_295.wav|49|He knew it would cost him millions.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_031.wav|41|Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_052.wav|20|He has written to the minister after meetings on the island.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_232.wav|19|It is a technique.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_470.wav|65|It is an industry failure.)
DUMMY2/p330/p330_255.wav|1|Otherwise it could have secured a cinema release.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_086.wav|60|This year the exercise is being repeated.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_312.wav|32|Everything in golf is a balance.)
DUMMY2/p343/p343_271.wav|21|I knew people on that committee.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_399.wav|106|You should always be able to get out in some direction.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_075.wav|28|It is difficult when you don't know anyone.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_124.wav|43|This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_256.wav|95|It could be to do with the location.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_152.wav|36|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_371.wav|36|There is no deal as yet.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_334.wav|94|Referees are easy targets.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_072.wav|66|It is time to give her a rest.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_141.wav|12|That's because we work hard at it.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_281.wav|106|They should stop the bombing.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_006.wav|76|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_145.wav|55|We hope he will do until he finally does the double.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_240.wav|63|You could feel the heat.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_314.wav|94|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_050.wav|77|We have to look beyond the very short term.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_071.wav|65|But I had never been in a theatre.)
DUMMY2/p294/p294_364.wav|104|I've got to provide for my family.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_099.wav|56|Before the game we went for a pint.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_085.wav|67|By then, he was walking on water.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_138.wav|16|It's hard to make these decisions at my age.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_440.wav|95|Which may be the same thing.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_164.wav|20|We need a new kind of theatre.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_131.wav|68|He loves the big occasions.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_304.wav|36|We are not doing the Today programme.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_319.wav|89|Is that an issue?
DUMMY2/p376/p376_190.wav|71|"Last night was a key episode."
DUMMY2/p362/p362_323.wav|15|Three other people were treated for minor injuries.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_437.wav|75|He said current trading was strong.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_236.wav|85|Where will the elderly go then?
DUMMY2/p323/p323_209.wav|34|I am pretty careful with money.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_170.wav|29|What do we want to do that for ?
DUMMY2/p340/p340_255.wav|74|We also hope to meet the men.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_001.wav|86|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_394.wav|19|You can't go back and change things.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_039.wav|13|And the newspapers were full of it.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_274.wav|68|My dad was working in Ayrshire.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_035.wav|53|It is about control of our economy.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_351.wav|56|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_070.wav|17|We're not the tourist board.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_077.wav|107|It is simple, really.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_186.wav|28|He was all blackened.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_166.wav|64|Its effect on humans is not yet known.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_203.wav|95|What are you not good at ?
DUMMY2/p268/p268_167.wav|87|YOU cannot blame the turnout.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_230.wav|106|The refund is fully justified.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_057.wav|30|I wouldn't want to miss that chance.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_180.wav|85|We played better after the break.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_045.wav|95|Among them are many criminals.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_359.wav|72|Darren is very, very good.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_212.wav|41|The FBI could become involved.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_043.wav|4|I knew my contract was up this year.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_232.wav|48|It would seem a natural progression.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_405.wav|55|Is it worth it ?
DUMMY2/p231/p231_120.wav|50|There were no grounds for his action.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_227.wav|40|The report is due out next month.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_141.wav|69|I had decided to quit the show.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_352.wav|23|Barry will be able to handle this.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_006.wav|46|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_236.wav|103|It really was a masterful innings.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_271.wav|73|We have to break that cycle.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_356.wav|25|Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_123.wav|91|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_354.wav|100|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_071.wav|38|But there are problems, such as retraining new staff.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_051.wav|102|On the contrary, some of the music is very expensive.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_233.wav|17|Obviously, someone is not doing their job properly.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_215.wav|0|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_069.wav|92|SO now we know the secret.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_049.wav|44|However, you have just got to adjust to it.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_077.wav|62|I started it, but then forgot all about it.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_014.wav|31|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_003.wav|99|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_105.wav|59|We felt at the moment, it was not possible.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_213.wav|104|We are very, very pleased with the response.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_154.wav|74|I've never regretted my decision.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_082.wav|92|Or is it the European approach?
DUMMY2/p249/p249_300.wav|80|Our task is to complete the picture.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_189.wav|34|Nothing like this has ever happened here before.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_198.wav|51|His director of football is leaving.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_053.wav|57|Here's a clue.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_133.wav|7|Before it was an ordeal.)
DUMMY2/p340/p340_411.wav|74|And it will be a challenge.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_297.wav|33|You are going to go to jail.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_047.wav|54|They were urged to get themselves in order.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_191.wav|56|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_308.wav|91|They will have to make changes.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_148.wav|29|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_481.wav|48|The rescue package is public money.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_405.wav|65|Good records have always been recognised by successful farmers.)
DUMMY2/p335/p335_338.wav|49|I put pressure on him.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_055.wav|100|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_351.wav|62|It was a horrible thing to happen.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_210.wav|100|A deadline is still essential.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_026.wav|5|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_113.wav|75|You can spend money on housing.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_313.wav|64|I'm not blaming audiences.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_271.wav|61|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_056.wav|29|How are you, sir ?
DUMMY2/p351/p351_299.wav|33|I started it, but then forgot all about it.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_253.wav|26|Her presence was almost everywhere.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_397.wav|39|The thing is to recognise that chance.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_248.wav|68|It is the end of an era.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_117.wav|10|That might help a bit.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_021.wav|104|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_358.wav|0|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_041.wav|69|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_008.wav|35|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_029.wav|30|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_263.wav|87|The shoppers knew it before City investors did.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_360.wav|29|He is not very big, either.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_239.wav|45|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_122.wav|28|It is the stop-gap before extinction.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_016.wav|107|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_100.wav|22|They serve a multitude of purposes.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_292.wav|105|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_141.wav|25|That brought a wonderful marriage of bass and soprano.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_238.wav|67|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_254.wav|59|they fail to engage.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_142.wav|97|We are so, so lucky, so many people have died.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_088.wav|24|Potions said he would drive.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_054.wav|64|My parents are exhausted.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_070.wav|9|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_063.wav|17|It is the end of an era.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_032.wav|37|The staff are very good.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_368.wav|52|It was a goal which came from nothing.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_392.wav|14|Rugby has an extended run.)
DUMMY2/p347/p347_088.wav|46|John Prescott is John Prescott, as the prime minister would say.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_075.wav|17|That was then and this is now.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_277.wav|47|But I've won both ways.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_341.wav|27|This is a big advantage.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_001.wav|48|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_033.wav|85|It is not for any other purpose.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_236.wav|54|It should be a great game, though.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_244.wav|6|Clearly, there was a mix-up.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_022.wav|79|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_007.wav|49|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_034.wav|52|But the Sunday Herald said it stood by its story.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_365.wav|63|It is understood the timescale for the refurbishment has slipped.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_321.wav|87|It gave me something to focus on.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_178.wav|51|It's just a normal life.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_158.wav|97|The research is published in the journal, Nature.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_307.wav|23|We've just got to work a bit better.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_115.wav|16|It is so sad.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_299.wav|0|He refused to name the survivors.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_143.wav|1|That is the last thing they need.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_062.wav|37|He looks like an Afghan.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_153.wav|15|A century on, little has changed.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_326.wav|11|We cannot go on like this.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_415.wav|85|I hope you don't regret it.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_029.wav|70|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_151.wav|104|It's like a score in some ways.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_320.wav|41|It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_146.wav|38|I would ask the fans to be patient.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_404.wav|35|It does not even have a staff shortage.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_071.wav|35|What do we do ?
DUMMY2/p300/p300_178.wav|102|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_130.wav|18|It is too much for me.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_188.wav|81|I came home by ambulance.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_071.wav|71|"They do not work for Glasgow City Council."
DUMMY2/p364/p364_263.wav|88|I've seen it work already.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_128.wav|99|Some of the characters will not be played by humans.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_387.wav|85|Mr Campbell received a phone call.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_251.wav|75|A small number of new jobs will also be created.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_361.wav|5|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_123.wav|52|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_391.wav|19|There are a number of possible outcomes.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_403.wav|105|It doesn't always work that way.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_189.wav|81|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_229.wav|95|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_379.wav|85|However, we let them back into the game.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_137.wav|46|However, it's good to turn the page.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_338.wav|56|Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_114.wav|70|It's a shame.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_086.wav|31|We do not get that impression now.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_349.wav|23|The family also declined to discuss the case.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_126.wav|3|He wanted to record the group.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_028.wav|101|Do I have a favourite ?
DUMMY2/p264/p264_001.wav|65|Please call Stella.  )
DUMMY2/p231/p231_354.wav|50|Neither man has been charged.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_059.wav|100|So is that it, then ?
DUMMY2/p336/p336_105.wav|98|Now, she has completed a family tradition.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_024.wav|90|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_207.wav|1|I think the euro has slipped.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_289.wav|15|It's an excellent idea that makes sense.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_219.wav|44|It has made me feel good.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_045.wav|64|However, the report was incorrect.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_015.wav|92|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_030.wav|44|Any error of judgment was ruled out.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_028.wav|30|Alright, it was a defeat, but it felt like a victory.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_108.wav|62|Then there was her childhood.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_062.wav|2|I was conceived in Aberdeen.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_364.wav|37|William Hague delighted his party.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_011.wav|45|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_199.wav|10|Last night was a key episode.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_282.wav|105|A new school will be built.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_016.wav|62|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_270.wav|90|He has not created a Festival resource.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_035.wav|81|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_299.wav|86|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_116.wav|50|I was deeply saddened by the death of Donald Dewar.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_259.wav|95|A small number of new jobs will also be created.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_004.wav|73|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_140.wav|103|Last night, however, other experts were cautious about the claim.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_003.wav|84|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_024.wav|68|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_242.wav|64|It ignores the future.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_246.wav|93|It is hard won.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_298.wav|2|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_279.wav|0|He has run a hell of a race.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_265.wav|36|I should think so, too.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_028.wav|76|I intend to raise the matter there.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_280.wav|104|It was one in the afternoon.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_189.wav|29|A copy of the report will be sent to them.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_164.wav|91|I thought it was a fantastic game.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_101.wav|3|I had no intention of misleading anyone.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_070.wav|100|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_073.wav|80|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_295.wav|92|We have to put pressure on Rangers.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_056.wav|86|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_406.wav|69|They recorded their debut album in New York.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_242.wav|24|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_030.wav|14|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.)
DUMMY2/p253/p253_091.wav|70|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_053.wav|14|The problems are a result of that shortfall.)
DUMMY2/p239/p239_400.wav|48|Analysts were impressed with progress made.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_042.wav|16|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_407.wav|85|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_052.wav|4|This is a holy place.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_186.wav|16|Peace was won.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_013.wav|66|Some have accepted it as a miracle without any physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_432.wav|63|They did the right thing.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_149.wav|77|That shows the strength of the US Tour.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_088.wav|9|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_164.wav|13|These are serious matters.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_038.wav|23|Seven people were later detained by police.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_361.wav|42|There is no sign of anyone being hurt.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_020.wav|27|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_075.wav|84|The talks were announced yesterday by Brian Wilson, the foreign office minister.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_109.wav|78|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_368.wav|31|He put some colour into Scottish history.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_002.wav|83|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_233.wav|34|He is, indeed, the grandson of travelling folk.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_467.wav|7|They offer a kind of narrative.)
DUMMY2/p345/p345_046.wav|82|I haven't enjoyed the last couple of years.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_164.wav|44|Arsenal have plenty in the tank.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_235.wav|94|And thought we would get away with it.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_020.wav|82|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_363.wav|85|Two people have died.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_261.wav|51|Nowadays, it is workers united.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_252.wav|105|they fail to engage.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_008.wav|46|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_047.wav|55|That's what set him apart.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_061.wav|21|He should be a great asset.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_336.wav|11|He has two children.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_084.wav|7|It is normal for me.)
DUMMY2/p228/p228_258.wav|57|They are real.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_222.wav|25|He's a nice guy.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_332.wav|69|Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_065.wav|83|It seems to have worked.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_317.wav|92|It's a member of your family.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_357.wav|87|William Hague delighted his party.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_026.wav|85|Meetings will also remain private.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_243.wav|92|When he came to see me on Monday.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_247.wav|33|It got no better.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_228.wav|16|The parties have been given until today to respond.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_399.wav|85|I think we believed the tie was won.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_323.wav|33|Others are expected to do so soon.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_125.wav|107|We are still getting signals.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_091.wav|26|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_345.wav|100|This ruling is a farce.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_195.wav|92|We have all been there at some point.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_124.wav|69|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_017.wav|37|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_312.wav|41|In the old days, it was easy.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_402.wav|75|We can produce a blueprint for farmers to follow.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_090.wav|20|Mr Livingstone described the decision as very damaging for the party.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_146.wav|80|Is that Titanic?
DUMMY2/p269/p269_312.wav|94|There is no openness.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_156.wav|0|Seven people were later detained by police.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_190.wav|89|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_127.wav|86|It's terrible that he has died the same way.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_095.wav|38|I thought they played very well.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_078.wav|89|Painful, but only because it's true.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_311.wav|33|We don't believe anything anymore.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_224.wav|20|The report is due out next month.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_313.wav|69|I came into this world with nothing.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_022.wav|20|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_139.wav|59|It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_046.wav|43|Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_117.wav|92|The Scots are, however, in good company.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_308.wav|93|We are now looking at the degrees of injury.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_340.wav|76|I'm pleased to get through the opening match.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_006.wav|94|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_322.wav|68|It is too early to speculate.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_037.wav|85|She is believed to be in South Africa.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_199.wav|16|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_042.wav|40|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_405.wav|78|It's all been about the basics of the business.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_321.wav|41|The boat was fantastic.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_036.wav|7|They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.)
DUMMY2/p300/p300_008.wav|102|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_329.wav|66|Soon the whole country will be level.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_296.wav|15|And this tournament will travel.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_142.wav|4|Four minutes later, the show was over.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_131.wav|35|She died at her home.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_179.wav|38|He was just like a godfather to it.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_204.wav|21|They made such decisions in London.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_264.wav|83|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_055.wav|4|They should go ahead as normal.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_184.wav|82|That in itself is an erotic experience.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_065.wav|9|And if he hadn't become a musician?
DUMMY2/p281/p281_141.wav|36|It is not just about pay.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_145.wav|81|So I got a blood test.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_158.wav|44|She was shouting my baby, my baby.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_381.wav|40|A parliament for England is the only way to redress the balance.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_057.wav|106|Among them are many criminals.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_222.wav|101|In each case they were a goal down.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_250.wav|96|He says that he is no different from any other man.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_257.wav|12|Two things will count for us in Brussels.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_332.wav|66|I'm not interested in coming up with answers.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_070.wav|51|These findings would be made public.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_141.wav|23|Ireland is also prepared to take in refugees.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_268.wav|87|They were never seen again by friends or relatives.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_132.wav|67|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_184.wav|12|We believe a third party was involved.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_020.wav|78|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_339.wav|35|The election is total confusion and chaos.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_377.wav|41|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_113.wav|27|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_097.wav|76|But Allen is deadly serious.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_302.wav|33|I would love to see it back there.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_009.wav|77|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_227.wav|86|The track is currently covered in snow.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_281.wav|20|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_266.wav|91|It was a moment of madness.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_249.wav|26|I should think so, too.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_050.wav|38|We feel it sends out the wrong message.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_192.wav|57|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_072.wav|92|I had no choice but to leave.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_424.wav|89|It was little else.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_333.wav|41|Today she has been released.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_088.wav|12|They had to be cut from the wreckage.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_071.wav|87|A spokeswoman for the Law Society of Scotland said.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_293.wav|87|The Royal Highland was no exception.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_003.wav|102|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_299.wav|78|Are they free ?
DUMMY2/p299/p299_311.wav|58|We are in a learning curve.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_209.wav|91|The prognosis is excellent.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_331.wav|42|They are now out in the cold.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_014.wav|94|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_255.wav|31|His body was never found.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_388.wav|27|They deserved the win.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_269.wav|81|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_326.wav|74|But don't just take my word for it.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_172.wav|56|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_119.wav|36|They've got to account for it.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_403.wav|79|What sort of man is that?
DUMMY2/p314/p314_306.wav|51|This is too much like Scotland.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_290.wav|52|He has been chosen as captain because of the person he is.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_167.wav|77|Why change it ?
DUMMY2/p254/p254_209.wav|41|A Grampian Police spokesman said.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_394.wav|60|I had to win this race.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_377.wav|51|Only local people are helping.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_359.wav|47|But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_265.wav|3|Investors were also concerned about margin pressure.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_225.wav|4|And it paid off.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_307.wav|22|Another casualty yesterday was John Prescott.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_028.wav|47|However, the following year the cancer returned.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_022.wav|13|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_140.wav|24|It is the latter which has prompted the warning.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_076.wav|17|Both will be heard at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_421.wav|63|This should put downward pressure on inflation.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_185.wav|77|However, Murray Johnstone is not on the menu.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_336.wav|76|He pleaded for caution.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_171.wav|62|They have got off with murder.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_407.wav|16|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_174.wav|3|That was the difference between the sides.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_326.wav|63|You are a different people.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_051.wav|16|I was inspired by two things.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_297.wav|32|It's called the Supreme Court for a reason.)
DUMMY2/p345/p345_101.wav|82|Certainly, there is much on the agenda.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_362.wav|66|Scotland is losing business.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_105.wav|38|That was a gold medal for certain.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_070.wav|44|Repayment is not part of the game.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_279.wav|79|No reason was given.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_258.wav|86|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_124.wav|21|We reckon we can do very well.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_354.wav|22|Clearly, she says, she would never resort to such devices.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_272.wav|31|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_256.wav|19|The reason is partly because of tradition.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_044.wav|36|But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_050.wav|105|He had no enemies.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_369.wav|67|We do not comment on the behaviour of our authors.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_186.wav|54|Angola was a really hard place.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_415.wav|36|Is it worth it ?
DUMMY2/p318/p318_177.wav|19|Perhaps it is jealousy.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_191.wav|52|You are not long home from work.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_212.wav|14|His injury was completely random.)
DUMMY2/p298/p298_094.wav|68|Scotland were beaten again.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_112.wav|23|There is no musical background in his family.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_193.wav|37|The squad is too small.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_027.wav|43|They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_157.wav|18|I'm not fit for anything else.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_150.wav|19|Still, in the end, it was a fair result.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_109.wav|92|We're in a state of shock and disbelief.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_347.wav|69|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_061.wav|70|It is unique.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_154.wav|3|There is a spring in the step.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_265.wav|106|I would have been shot dead in bed.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_345.wav|69|It was only a matter of time before someone was killed.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_023.wav|67|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_219.wav|104|Then they killed another three.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_358.wav|24|We have very limited capacity.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_344.wav|21|They will be up for it for sure.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_139.wav|107|The singer's condition was not specified.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_378.wav|70|Does that put pressure on us?
DUMMY2/p247/p247_048.wav|14|It had little effect on European equity markets.)
DUMMY2/p311/p311_230.wav|4|He admitted the asylum system was not working.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_268.wav|106|We will turn the corner.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_332.wav|28|Nato has completed planning for air strikes.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_119.wav|62|What's the theme?
DUMMY2/p282/p282_333.wav|83|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_442.wav|37|Now we see no mention of rising rates.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_153.wav|38|Europe is a hugely contentious issue.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_136.wav|48|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_182.wav|78|It was by the numbers.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_061.wav|58|We hope this scheme will change that.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_352.wav|85|The pensioners did not want to know.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_273.wav|62|It is the icing on the cake.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_305.wav|16|They are wrong.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_376.wav|107|We have always been, and remain confident of securing the order.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_027.wav|52|I've got the same feeling as I had last week in Germany.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_012.wav|53|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_208.wav|2|It's not ideal.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_154.wav|38|It was a Budget for jobs for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_464.wav|48|We also acknowledge the grief and pain of their relatives.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_092.wav|45|They are now divorced.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_099.wav|67|He is hungry for success and I am the same.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_086.wav|40|It is a lifeline.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_072.wav|30|I'm thinking, what would be easier?
DUMMY2/p339/p339_223.wav|18|Without doubt, they can win the title.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_164.wav|100|Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_201.wav|101|The early goal was a shock to the system for Hearts.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_194.wav|18|This will have to change.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_353.wav|80|I kept going for her.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_045.wav|74|I have lost all confidence.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_252.wav|56|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_227.wav|18|I called it right.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_303.wav|94|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_233.wav|33|We've never seen so many.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_412.wav|34|Last night, the row continued.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_256.wav|73|Souter will be back.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_290.wav|95|I have a lot of relatives in this part of the country.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_227.wav|90|My neighbours are horrified.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_306.wav|25|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_197.wav|80|It is tough, but possible.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_291.wav|77|We have to be very, very careful.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_349.wav|61|Nobody else was with me.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_287.wav|42|Its people are inventive, talented and diligent.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_379.wav|89|Since then, he has played no active part in the company.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_025.wav|64|He needed seven hours of surgery.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_252.wav|18|I was very surprised.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_032.wav|55|The key to the whole project will be environmental concern.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_345.wav|54|I didn't have a trio.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_085.wav|8|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_282.wav|55|Their only score of the half came from a penalty by Jones.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_121.wav|34|A Scotsman has to defend his castle.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_052.wav|90|It has been a horrible, horrible time.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_107.wav|30|You'll get on like a house on fire.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_293.wav|28|We have to adapt to this level.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_129.wav|40|Who will attend?
DUMMY2/p305/p305_160.wav|54|Hopefully, now we're getting it.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_261.wav|80|That's the only thing I will say.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_004.wav|97|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_065.wav|23|Let us hope so.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_189.wav|41|I wanted to put myself on the line.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_045.wav|96|It is urgent.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_171.wav|106|Scottish Enterprise and the banks have been very supportive.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_102.wav|90|They are now divorced.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_261.wav|44|Things were not easy from the outset.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_193.wav|103|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_138.wav|93|We want to keep the pound.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_253.wav|8|Everything depends on the weather.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_215.wav|102|If we live forever, can we really be said to live?
DUMMY2/p299/p299_166.wav|58|And does it?
DUMMY2/p306/p306_024.wav|12|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_093.wav|17|England could not take anything for granted, however.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_332.wav|9|However, the groups denied the claims.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_224.wav|94|Who was on the panel?
DUMMY2/p345/p345_278.wav|82|But that is about to change.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_053.wav|96|It's the big omission.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_132.wav|57|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_323.wav|27|We are in the end game.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_197.wav|15|It is quite a young team, so the future is there.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_055.wav|94|New York is expected to come to a standstill.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_321.wav|93|We are a peaceful people.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_014.wav|5|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_066.wav|45|It is like a river running by my home.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_278.wav|87|The happiness was slightly misplaced.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_363.wav|42|So, where do we go from here?
DUMMY2/p265/p265_257.wav|73|I am just trying to do my job.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_387.wav|84|It was a breathtaking moment.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_234.wav|80|He is in the queue.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_166.wav|60|A good actor doesn't think.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_427.wav|56|It was a breathtaking moment.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_328.wav|66|It is a question of balance.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_133.wav|107|I was just overwhelmed.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_443.wav|75|We would have concerns about that.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_012.wav|103|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_012.wav|99|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_360.wav|39|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_004.wav|94|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_178.wav|104|Harry will be up for it.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_066.wav|22|And she doesn't feel like Annika is better.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_103.wav|30|He is only now regaining his confidence.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_304.wav|42|That, too, was over two years ago.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_395.wav|10|They have not got anyone.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_112.wav|0|I was on a roll.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_204.wav|65|People elsewhere in Scotland will feel cut off by this.)
DUMMY2/p340/p340_374.wav|74|There are not enough of them.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_319.wav|37|Jim has not been a problem for me at all.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_208.wav|48|He has many offers from the English Premiership.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_286.wav|79|And she is very clear on this.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_002.wav|29|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_192.wav|30|I felt we had fallen back a little.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_067.wav|25|They were too hard.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_029.wav|85|We have worked hard.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_067.wav|88|Perhaps it was her demeanour.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_277.wav|18|That includes the equipment?
DUMMY2/p314/p314_337.wav|51|The whole thing would be perfect.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_182.wav|74|I came here this week to work.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_402.wav|66|Jack McConnell is the obvious choice.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_061.wav|50|So is that it, then ?
DUMMY2/p238/p238_265.wav|37|The agreement remains the only show in town.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_088.wav|86|And rugby fans can help.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_351.wav|29|There will have to be a full inquiry.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_256.wav|84|The distinction is also supported by doctors.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_304.wav|29|The partnership was set up during the summer.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_073.wav|59|This is the way things should be handled.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_347.wav|10|And he is immensely loyal.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_189.wav|89|It's a fact.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_273.wav|8|Who was she ?
DUMMY2/p287/p287_227.wav|77|So far, the problems have occurred in the US.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_018.wav|92|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_015.wav|33|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_387.wav|50|I wanted to go out on a high.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_361.wav|76|Well, you can have a tree.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_276.wav|76|There have been different reports from different people.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_150.wav|55|Why change it ?
DUMMY2/p231/p231_025.wav|50|On our numbers, the price is in line with the asset value.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_153.wav|36|My Dad is a hero.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_376.wav|25|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_354.wav|24|It's wonderful to have won.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_186.wav|5|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_126.wav|55|Gold admitted as much.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_212.wav|105|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_338.wav|19|They've been wonderful to me.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_175.wav|0|I would not count on it.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_243.wav|11|We can make a difference.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_031.wav|29|The Premier League has been a huge success.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_163.wav|75|Seven people were later detained by police.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_319.wav|12|I tend to not look back.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_058.wav|99|It's very odd.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_036.wav|107|I wanted the illusion of space and depth.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_357.wav|59|You must have a government and a good civil service.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_069.wav|52|I cannot believe that someone would pay so much for works like these.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_067.wav|36|It is a real problem.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_225.wav|76|This was not an easy meeting for me.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_277.wav|77|Did he trip ?
DUMMY2/p314/p314_266.wav|51|Lara is very, very much a girl.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_011.wav|87|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_080.wav|106|Why do it otherwise ?
DUMMY2/p293/p293_385.wav|23|It was even worse than at home.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_049.wav|7|I had come back from London.)
DUMMY2/p253/p253_054.wav|70|Every aspect of our play was first class.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_225.wav|1|But it's just great to have won.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_291.wav|35|It was never a free kick.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_124.wav|7|It is too pretty, it is too small.)
DUMMY2/p323/p323_311.wav|34|This makes up for it.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_200.wav|77|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_062.wav|66|They were not doing it too well, either.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_040.wav|9|It was clear.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_091.wav|27|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_233.wav|26|They had no children.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_086.wav|3|How are you, sir ?
DUMMY2/p340/p340_350.wav|74|He has been under great pressure.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_289.wav|22|Children are using books in a terrible condition.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_002.wav|3|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_068.wav|30|YOU thought it was a headache.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_097.wav|54|My grandparents were terrified.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_046.wav|14|It's not a swimming pool out there.)
DUMMY2/p231/p231_031.wav|50|The Premier League has been a huge success.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_351.wav|66|The science is well known, the solution is simple.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_100.wav|80|We must look forward.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_095.wav|83|Yet, it worked.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_411.wav|0|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_106.wav|39|There is a contract in existence for Allan.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_131.wav|33|He said it was the worst possible result.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_230.wav|13|If only he knew himself.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_177.wav|1|I have no battle with the Scots.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_391.wav|10|One-third of the places are already taken.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_341.wav|41|It is not like working for a living.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_081.wav|18|It all happened so suddenly.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_283.wav|45|I saw it at a ruck.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_341.wav|91|I am not putting myself down.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_177.wav|36|The second aspect was the fear of failure.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_344.wav|24|We will listen to any suggestion.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_173.wav|13|I cannot speak on behalf of the IRA.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_241.wav|103|I was happiest with my short game.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_367.wav|57|By that time, however, it was already too late.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_387.wav|38|At present it is fairly uncommon, but its incidence is increasing.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_139.wav|4|They got the job done.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_067.wav|58|Now, just two games into the season, he has gone.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_154.wav|56|Further growth will be funded from cash flow.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_006.wav|65|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. )
DUMMY2/p280/p280_113.wav|52|Is there a waiting list ?
DUMMY2/p330/p330_109.wav|1|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_291.wav|23|He had played well in that central role.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_197.wav|28|That is a matter for Mr Graham.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_076.wav|74|There was still more disquiet in Israel.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_263.wav|74|People were very confused.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_206.wav|91|It opens the door to the Champions League.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_370.wav|14|He had no access to the database.)
DUMMY2/p225/p225_359.wav|101|But we welcome this document.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_327.wav|94|I was rubbish.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_441.wav|7|It was submitted without their knowledge.)
DUMMY2/p264/p264_320.wav|65|The performance continues to improve.)
DUMMY2/p363/p363_043.wav|6|His film is not.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_061.wav|45|There was a battle there.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_268.wav|7|How independent is that ?)
DUMMY2/p266/p266_346.wav|20|It is long gone.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_201.wav|98|It wouldn't go off.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_480.wav|48|Five years later, the deception continued.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_083.wav|23|However, my position remains the same.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_251.wav|79|That was my last game.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_262.wav|45|I am very angry.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_230.wav|11|We used to keep our business rates.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_023.wav|72|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_050.wav|57|Hopefully, it will be built by next year.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_038.wav|13|It is just like the stock market.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_209.wav|0|I had relied on him.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_129.wav|36|They made such decisions in London.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_272.wav|15|There's always a chance.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_245.wav|90|The scene is about this?
DUMMY2/p240/p240_146.wav|93|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_125.wav|84|That's all right then.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_093.wav|102|But the relief was short-lived.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_280.wav|53|The life office will now stay with Abbey.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_138.wav|36|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_286.wav|87|How independent is that ?
DUMMY2/p246/p246_051.wav|5|Every aspect of our play was first class.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_045.wav|67|It will come all right.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_419.wav|18|We should have been rewarded for producing.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_295.wav|60|But it didn't bother me.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_359.wav|100|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_099.wav|43|He is hungry for success and I am the same.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_074.wav|102|What are you supposed to do, just walk away?
DUMMY2/p294/p294_050.wav|104|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_336.wav|10|That reflected a tumble in banking shares across the board.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_040.wav|11|I've had a ball.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_341.wav|18|Let's not make that mistake again.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_311.wav|89|A review is under way.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_155.wav|23|However, his remarks were heavily qualified.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_418.wav|39|I had a tie in my hand.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_038.wav|102|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_365.wav|33|I believe she was elected unopposed.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_214.wav|94|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_121.wav|72|It's something he works hard at achieving.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_249.wav|17|Staff should be paid for what they produce.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_249.wav|99|It was a cry for help.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_048.wav|2|Here's a clue.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_005.wav|26|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_059.wav|94|Art is extra.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_237.wav|77|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_361.wav|51|We are still going ahead with our plans.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_223.wav|21|But he kept on repeating it.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_350.wav|106|I won't make an official complaint.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_136.wav|25|I am now unemployed.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_242.wav|15|Mental health is a massive issue.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_331.wav|65|He had played very well.)
DUMMY2/p263/p263_346.wav|39|In the old days, it was easy.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_310.wav|32|The rescue package is public money.)
DUMMY2/p336/p336_271.wav|98|I've had a wonderful career.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_204.wav|36|There was no way back for United after that.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_028.wav|69|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_401.wav|50|She is in their hands.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_348.wav|61|Look at the witnesses.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_145.wav|60|What's it going to be then?
DUMMY2/p343/p343_051.wav|21|I expect a rapid response.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_102.wav|43|I am not willing to say anything about any couple.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_088.wav|28|We have them in offices all over.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_063.wav|52|There were no details of the other five victims.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_230.wav|91|Sullivan was later charged with her murder, which she denied.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_287.wav|9|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_166.wav|1|It was horrible, but there is still more.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_067.wav|24|We are talking about the outskirts of London.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_204.wav|91|Europe has lost its way under the socialists.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_274.wav|104|It's as simple as that.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_200.wav|49|Next time around, it will be different.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_258.wav|5|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_338.wav|92|However, the second goal was about to be delivered.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_317.wav|19|They deserve a lot of credit.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_160.wav|94|We want to see the maximum of change.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_023.wav|6|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_065.wav|2|There could be a way back.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_064.wav|88|I knew the script.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_235.wav|82|Another casualty yesterday was John Prescott.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_046.wav|71|"That should do it."
DUMMY2/p249/p249_105.wav|80|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_196.wav|69|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_033.wav|72|They agree to meet.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_183.wav|84|I always felt they played for me.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_302.wav|86|It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_367.wav|105|A council spokesman said it had been a constructive meeting.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_118.wav|70|The mood is upbeat.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_317.wav|55|That wasn't an outstanding performance from Celtic.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_042.wav|92|A final agreement has not yet been completed.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_063.wav|87|This trend is likely to strengthen.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_104.wav|41|I love the Dome.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_048.wav|25|It is urgent.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_281.wav|100|The offer will run for the next three weekends.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_075.wav|96|The price cuts are really exciting.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_091.wav|91|People love to see this stuff.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_127.wav|21|We are not with you.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_292.wav|70|But it's a subtle process.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_338.wav|17|We don't know the scale of need.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_208.wav|103|Sentence was deferred for background reports.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_141.wav|63|My life has changed a lot.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_412.wav|19|Yes, it gave me a lot of confidence.
