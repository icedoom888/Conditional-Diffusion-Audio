DUMMY2/p361/p361_056.wav|79|That is the way it is.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_173.wav|7|We have a budget in March.)
DUMMY2/p278/p278_367.wav|10|Their condition is described as satisfactory.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_147.wav|15|I don't think we deserved to lose.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_173.wav|94|Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_007.wav|105|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_269.wav|22|I am not happy with proposals for widows.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_401.wav|104|In fact, he should never have been in the field.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_352.wav|47|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_274.wav|74|The second half was a different affair.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_229.wav|34|That period was a struggle.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_024.wav|48|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_469.wav|32|He will not be involved in school discipline.)
DUMMY2/p326/p326_097.wav|28|Around the building, the atmosphere is brittle and hung over.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_394.wav|0|Overall, the labour market continued to tighten.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_345.wav|85|It was extremely cold.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_347.wav|51|They are the heroes.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_355.wav|56|But the Foreign Secretary can cope.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_294.wav|8|It's hard to see it.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_238.wav|93|It's quite a line-up!
DUMMY2/p261/p261_007.wav|100|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_182.wav|107|By social devices, the two groups are coming together.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_074.wav|56|This view was echoed by another Scottish analyst.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_186.wav|15|Film music was never the same again.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_187.wav|73|Is that success?
DUMMY2/p266/p266_056.wav|20|They're appalled by that.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_383.wav|65|This is too much like Scotland.)
DUMMY2/p317/p317_257.wav|97|Health care workers and labourers followed.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_146.wav|78|When we played them last year, we were beaten by the weather.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_082.wav|41|The company yesterday refused to comment.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_230.wav|65|Many changes are positive changes.)
DUMMY2/p278/p278_295.wav|10|It was never a free kick.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_274.wav|106|Do I think about them often ?
DUMMY2/p318/p318_323.wav|19|As if they ever stopped.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_093.wav|63|So, did she meet him ?
DUMMY2/p233/p233_331.wav|84|Who will do it ?
DUMMY2/p238/p238_150.wav|37|It is a vicious circle.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_114.wav|7|The whole thing is the music.)
DUMMY2/p340/p340_016.wav|74|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_010.wav|39|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_402.wav|46|It was not a foul.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_149.wav|15|We couldn't believe it at first.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_352.wav|52|Sales will begin by the end of October.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_176.wav|60|The process will start tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_180.wav|4|Finally, they have a journey back to their youth.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_090.wav|35|I did not have a bet on myself.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_005.wav|1|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_380.wav|102|They did not threaten anyone.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_346.wav|35|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_192.wav|22|That, though, was again according to the manager McCall.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_051.wav|15|Meanwhile, the action is spreading to Eastern Europe.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_207.wav|16|In each case they were a goal down.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_153.wav|60|It was a moment of madness.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_330.wav|3|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_210.wav|7|was everything done to save people ?)
DUMMY2/p303/p303_340.wav|44|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_274.wav|65|The third has yet to be named.)
DUMMY2/p265/p265_310.wav|73|My view has now completely changed.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_315.wav|86|The home team had an amazing start.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_337.wav|52|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
DUMMY2/p268/p268_323.wav|87|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_304.wav|98|They are not always the same person.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_435.wav|106|It makes no difference to their friendship.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_392.wav|15|This makes up for it.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_370.wav|42|The vacancies are in support services and arts.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_118.wav|36|It is much as it has been described.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_229.wav|54|Gilbert was not amused.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_368.wav|37|We can have no complaints.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_188.wav|84|There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_037.wav|13|Everything is obviously in the very early stages.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_375.wav|17|It is playing long, but it is also in beautiful condition.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_338.wav|9|I am so upset.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_297.wav|84|Who can predict ?
DUMMY2/p247/p247_309.wav|14|The rescue package is public money.)
DUMMY2/p238/p238_165.wav|37|The arrangement will avoid any conflicts of interest.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_379.wav|25|I'm pleased about one thing.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_260.wav|25|People should not become complacent.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_251.wav|11|It was not pretty.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_265.wav|65|Some changes have been achieved at great cost.)
DUMMY2/p272/p272_195.wav|69|But she might be.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_372.wav|28|However, there are no plans for injecting rooms.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_159.wav|95|I was caught out a little bit.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_285.wav|76|I would never even consider it.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_142.wav|35|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_139.wav|27|I was dead.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_311.wav|12|An aide was instructed to get a copy.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_237.wav|33|That is important for the club.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_318.wav|50|That meant the search was unlawful.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_305.wav|24|Funding would come from both Scotland and Northern Ireland.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_322.wav|77|It is a court case.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_071.wav|41|Jobs could go.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_035.wav|78|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_401.wav|66|I'll take what comes along.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_421.wav|32|I was pleased with my own game.)
DUMMY2/p269/p269_361.wav|94|It is long gone.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_024.wav|84|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_123.wav|95|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_254.wav|31|Chambers said he would accept the place.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_352.wav|48|They had declined in each of the two preceding quarters.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_099.wav|52|Even if he doesn't have any lines.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_033.wav|77|I thought it was an accident.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_053.wav|70|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_059.wav|86|There was a battle there.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_065.wav|18|It has affected it, obviously.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_122.wav|48|They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_380.wav|1|Debate is not just talk.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_161.wav|74|He has to learn.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_335.wav|85|That was a disgraceful performance.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_254.wav|55|We were leading by two goals.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_095.wav|16|I love the Dome.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_143.wav|30|Lord Levy said he'd started his life with nothing.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_037.wav|52|That was not perfect golf by any means.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_146.wav|104|You ask the question.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_275.wav|78|He was good, but not that good.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_106.wav|50|So what is the campaign about ?
DUMMY2/p274/p274_451.wav|32|It could cause a little bit of disruption.)
DUMMY2/p233/p233_242.wav|84|We were extremely poor.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_242.wav|107|So we said, no, we're not going to do that.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_358.wav|66|Nothing was going to go right.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_112.wav|57|We have an election in eight days.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_199.wav|40|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_385.wav|15|He had taken everything from me.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_324.wav|102|Our place as artists is to ask questions.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_074.wav|19|But you can go beyond that condition.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_157.wav|41|I was in daily contact.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_238.wav|75|This will secure the future of our industry.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_226.wav|98|The biggest resource is our staff.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_330.wav|95|He will address the nation this evening.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_111.wav|78|There, you were just a body.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_191.wav|79|Anything less will not do.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_365.wav|4|It's unusual to say the least.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_005.wav|101|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_300.wav|70|This is a war over our home.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_197.wav|29|The force is with them.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_225.wav|107|No meaningful response was issued.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_304.wav|102|We've always had three options, and none of them are perfect.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_343.wav|80|They should take their mobile phones.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_226.wav|84|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_209.wav|3|I will be in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_291.wav|10|Truth is the child of time.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_324.wav|38|Equally, he is grateful to have survived the cull.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_173.wav|38|But the Premiership is everything to us.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_240.wav|37|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_062.wav|58|It was created by genocide.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_044.wav|1|Our decision making was poor.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_040.wav|104|My view has now changed completely.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_073.wav|73|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_022.wav|73|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_265.wav|21|Worry can have that effect on some citizens.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_368.wav|83|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_102.wav|35|This was a good move for me.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_358.wav|1|The goal will stay with me forever.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_165.wav|87|But the relief was short-lived.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_202.wav|39|I think, therefore I am ?
DUMMY2/p301/p301_137.wav|91|The ethos of the school was outstanding.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_257.wav|66|That might happen in Pakistan, but in Britain?
DUMMY2/p316/p316_234.wav|85|She said he did not look too happy.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_312.wav|14|I was there five months ago.)
DUMMY2/p252/p252_306.wav|55|We must move on.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_332.wav|2|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_405.wav|18|We await a decision.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_344.wav|7|Sunday's game was not a trial.)
DUMMY2/p303/p303_131.wav|44|He loves the big occasions.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_436.wav|8|I didn't get to keep it.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_027.wav|3|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_221.wav|15|And, within itself, it is visionary.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_163.wav|0|Are you from the rugby ?
DUMMY2/p318/p318_275.wav|19|The rubble was right up to the ceiling.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_336.wav|62|He will be advised by me.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_015.wav|58|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_307.wav|44|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_250.wav|35|We have to compete at our own level.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_256.wav|77|He was on a horse.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_102.wav|15|This Government is cutting taxes.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_234.wav|18|The reaction of staff has been fantastic.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_009.wav|30|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_282.wav|78|On a practical level, it would be difficult.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_395.wav|95|He has an equity stake in the investment house.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_326.wav|55|Other teams moved up too.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_060.wav|1|This is a big club.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_252.wav|65|The pension levels will remain the same.)
DUMMY2/p225/p225_254.wav|101|The problem was a social problem.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_317.wav|2|I came into this world with nothing.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_061.wav|78|That was the difference today.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_169.wav|61|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_340.wav|5|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_107.wav|38|I didn't make those adjustments.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_327.wav|14|Job losses were also announced.)
DUMMY2/p323/p323_308.wav|34|We have other options.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_362.wav|48|Walker plans to return indoors.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_216.wav|31|Her home is perhaps a couple of miles from the town centre.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_283.wav|49|I think it will make a huge difference.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_369.wav|38|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_282.wav|50|That view has not altered.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_009.wav|81|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_009.wav|104|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_098.wav|66|It is a great honour and a privilege.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_154.wav|73|It is not like us.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_410.wav|26|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_216.wav|8|It would appear to be a good time to invest.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_297.wav|82|Immediate action must be taken.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_403.wav|6|It is a large number.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_375.wav|32|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.)
DUMMY2/p241/p241_273.wav|86|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_189.wav|7|Our destiny is in our own hands.)
DUMMY2/p251/p251_161.wav|9|Eight months later, he was dead.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_316.wav|40|The election is total confusion and chaos.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_234.wav|63|They are difficult awards to decide.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_139.wav|84|Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_364.wav|99|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_275.wav|13|You've got to have both sides.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_419.wav|38|This is a thoroughly handsome and enjoyable production.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_063.wav|89|It is unique.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_302.wav|59|And he goes with it.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_291.wav|12|It's not even finished.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_069.wav|22|I'm just feeling very tired - but it's great.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_057.wav|84|Still, he did not let himself down this week.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_192.wav|89|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_046.wav|102|We will continue to operate within the sport.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_197.wav|84|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_416.wav|65|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.)
DUMMY2/p330/p330_131.wav|1|Two people are allowed to share the duty.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_018.wav|26|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_110.wav|68|There was no time scale.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_123.wav|58|However, in Scotland this figure was four weeks.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_160.wav|56|Phase one was a shambles.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_052.wav|9|I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_292.wav|82|My life has been turned upside down.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_081.wav|7|Potions said he would drive.)
DUMMY2/p280/p280_227.wav|52|This takes no account of hotel and tourism losses.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_242.wav|37|It is not normal practice.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_234.wav|97|That's the whole idea.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_300.wav|85|Everyone agrees with that.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_177.wav|91|But is it ethical to practice in humans?
DUMMY2/p239/p239_008.wav|48|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_136.wav|32|This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely.)
DUMMY2/p275/p275_090.wav|40|But I was wrong.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_357.wav|11|Scottish Women appear at Eden Court, Inverness, tonight.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_013.wav|72|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_089.wav|12|We defended well, but couldn't do much in attack.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_174.wav|34|Michael is putting on a brave face.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_327.wav|97|The World Trade Centre was our Main Street.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_130.wav|106|Potions said he would drive.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_141.wav|75|So I got a blood test.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_139.wav|21|This is the logic of punishment assaults.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_287.wav|52|Wall Street provided the British market with little fresh direction.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_391.wav|8|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_143.wav|2|IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_219.wav|7|The early physical reports were clear.)
DUMMY2/p343/p343_019.wav|21|Since the physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_327.wav|52|I try to be open to experience.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_126.wav|30|And perhaps it is as simple as that.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_016.wav|30|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_238.wav|16|The scene is about this?
DUMMY2/p305/p305_180.wav|54|So he is open to ideas.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_327.wav|48|They make a selective perception process.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_272.wav|68|Sergio was talking his chances down yesterday.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_338.wav|0|Does that put pressure on us ?
DUMMY2/p238/p238_298.wav|37|They will probably come back.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_021.wav|74|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_156.wav|90|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_043.wav|10|Must be prepared to use it.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_302.wav|92|Sub Not Used, McCormick.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_252.wav|90|Her presence was almost everywhere.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_384.wav|89|One day, he threw the baby against a wall.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_359.wav|98|I'd like to run.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_217.wav|60|We had to work hard for it.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_184.wav|50|So many people will be affected by this.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_174.wav|5|Tony had arrived.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_344.wav|70|It was only a matter of time before someone was killed.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_361.wav|48|We can't give any figures for Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_101.wav|63|It really was an unusual award.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_040.wav|33|We are getting people into work.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_181.wav|80|You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_417.wav|48|The baby deserves the credit.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_106.wav|80|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_152.wav|35|I'm afraid to say anything.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_336.wav|66|People might not actually want the job.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_025.wav|103|But there has never been the time, she said.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_468.wav|100|No options are excluded at all.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_081.wav|55|Why do it otherwise ?
DUMMY2/p250/p250_160.wav|24|He was pleased with his display.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_200.wav|103|But these were the nights.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_178.wav|98|The bombing has had a huge influence.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_153.wav|35|We are still getting over it.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_139.wav|51|We would love for him to stay, but he's going home.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_016.wav|60|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_396.wav|39|He later became a respected High Court judge.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_228.wav|98|How will we get there?
DUMMY2/p247/p247_277.wav|14|He is quite well organised.)
DUMMY2/p233/p233_140.wav|84|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_101.wav|81|They tried to deny it.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_176.wav|14|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.)
DUMMY2/p267/p267_403.wav|0|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
DUMMY2/p251/p251_050.wav|9|It is the whole package.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_269.wav|11|We don't need to change the law.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_357.wav|86|Our numbers are small.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_279.wav|105|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_235.wav|24|The process will start tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_330.wav|48|Thereafter they were allowed to proceed.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_151.wav|62|I fell into it by accident.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_300.wav|64|I know you went back this morning.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_259.wav|34|He said to me, Which one, son?
DUMMY2/p277/p277_335.wav|89|He loves the big occasions.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_082.wav|67|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_388.wav|40|I'm glad I came.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_256.wav|15|This will have no effect on the championship.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_379.wav|49|There's no support for it at all.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_192.wav|48|My father died in childbirth.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_194.wav|76|That will depend on the outcome of inquiries.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_193.wav|18|That was very important.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_045.wav|19|I never had a childhood.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_188.wav|57|It's a portrait of Glasgow, not the portrait.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_410.wav|19|I knew people on that committee.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_245.wav|17|They are not an item.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_308.wav|25|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_388.wav|36|A review is under way.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_363.wav|29|We are encouraged by the news.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_086.wav|87|He's not getting into any games.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_006.wav|67|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_207.wav|55|My targets for the Scottish Conservative party are high.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_241.wav|39|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_157.wav|52|When it happened, he could hardly believe it.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_010.wav|41|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_026.wav|37|The first appeared to be successful.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_365.wav|89|By that time, however, it was already too late.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_233.wav|63|These things have not happened by accident.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_111.wav|14|Our house was very small.)
DUMMY2/p257/p257_008.wav|105|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_343.wav|100|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
DUMMY2/p277/p277_259.wav|89|It's very nice.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_391.wav|23|I do not believe they are.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_353.wav|59|The decision is an absolute disgrace.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_221.wav|41|Clearly, the stakes are high.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_413.wav|42|It is a thing of beauty to watch.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_217.wav|99|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_037.wav|45|It was clear.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_396.wav|69|The car was just there.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_401.wav|56|It was a funny game.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_126.wav|80|You can spend money on housing.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_103.wav|41|The group is due to report by the end of the year.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_275.wav|95|On Wednesday, it is the turn of Cable Wireless.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_207.wav|31|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_142.wav|61|He has the edge.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_217.wav|33|He took over our lives.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_286.wav|66|The fans will support us.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_221.wav|43|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_199.wav|95|The hotel was now for sale.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_331.wav|55|Our relationship has been very good.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_074.wav|107|We actually haven't managed to meet demand.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_233.wav|3|But it may not be all bad news.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_074.wav|83|It could take some time.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_204.wav|63|how do you get it back ?
DUMMY2/p287/p287_137.wav|77|Three hours later, the man was free.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_423.wav|34|Harold is a rarity.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_418.wav|19|Would they work together again?
DUMMY2/p304/p304_016.wav|72|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_146.wav|27|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_149.wav|95|Before it was an ordeal.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_212.wav|52|It is going to change the world.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_387.wav|39|But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_409.wav|105|It goes with the job.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_019.wav|26|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_296.wav|82|I said, What was that about?
DUMMY2/p334/p334_186.wav|38|Thirteen people will be made redundant.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_070.wav|62|The effect was almost magical.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_336.wav|70|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_336.wav|24|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_197.wav|104|He said nothing to waiting journalists.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_160.wav|62|If it's not, they didn't go far enough.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_130.wav|89|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_068.wav|35|It may be that lifestyle is behind it.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_068.wav|105|There could be a way back.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_269.wav|91|I am not happy with proposals for widows.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_347.wav|62|Saddam is not threatening this country.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_014.wav|3|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_432.wav|36|He will be judged by his actions.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_362.wav|86|This is a club on the rise.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_329.wav|29|He would help me with the form.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_258.wav|23|That fight begins today for freedom and liberty.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_227.wav|12|It was a poor performance.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_333.wav|69|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_255.wav|12|The site has been fully recorded and surveyed.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_130.wav|77|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_359.wav|65|It had been introduced over six years.)
DUMMY2/p250/p250_495.wav|24|We would welcome a commercial partner or partners.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_011.wav|41|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_092.wav|107|We don't say there wasn't a massacre.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_138.wav|0|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_318.wav|22|However, civil rights campaigners welcomed the ruling.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_062.wav|33|My players are special.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_148.wav|61|He is severe.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_455.wav|100|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_377.wav|103|The written judgment was issued in printed form.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_386.wav|89|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_339.wav|75|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_381.wav|11|He was taken ill in his office.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_303.wav|68|But, even so, you always want to try something new.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_041.wav|65|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.)
DUMMY2/p239/p239_126.wav|48|Their season has been consigned to history.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_221.wav|81|But she was.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_151.wav|12|That would be poetic, wouldn't it?
DUMMY2/p246/p246_193.wav|5|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_189.wav|92|That's how he did the damage.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_183.wav|37|Again he dismissed a merger with Halifax.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_231.wav|37|So I got a blood test.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_092.wav|37|Final proposals will be published in February.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_169.wav|106|His job was not advertised.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_204.wav|28|Was this a new event?
DUMMY2/p225/p225_142.wav|101|Well, you can have a tree.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_073.wav|79|It is on the news.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_008.wav|33|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_355.wav|66|I have not been so angry for years.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_092.wav|34|Will they fall out?
DUMMY2/p310/p310_176.wav|17|That was moving the goalposts.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_395.wav|38|His condition was stable last night.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_240.wav|36|You could feel the heat.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_260.wav|103|Broadcasting will be top of the agenda.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_300.wav|15|How can they get one?
DUMMY2/p231/p231_180.wav|50|I have spoken to head office.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_086.wav|67|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_325.wav|16|Mr Blair is the problem in Scotland, not the solution.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_181.wav|40|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_120.wav|87|The ethos of the school was outstanding.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_072.wav|56|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_086.wav|62|Action must be taken urgently.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_397.wav|22|Partition is not an option.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_035.wav|40|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_384.wav|58|There is a lot of anger.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_166.wav|74|It was very exciting.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_284.wav|48|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_032.wav|75|He should emerge as the winner.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_229.wav|78|It still has an effect.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_283.wav|7|I should think so, too.)
DUMMY2/p343/p343_246.wav|21|He died later in hospital.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_033.wav|66|Everything was up for grabs.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_371.wav|40|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_076.wav|102|Henman is taking nothing for granted.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_077.wav|17|Europe has lost its way under the socialists.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_249.wav|75|Do I think about them often ?
DUMMY2/p272/p272_375.wav|69|Something is wrong.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_341.wav|83|Tyson is overwhelmed.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_118.wav|83|The mood is upbeat.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_003.wav|64|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_140.wav|19|But every two minutes it was exploding.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_134.wav|40|It plans to return to this field.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_039.wav|81|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_316.wav|92|The attack was totally out of the blue.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_415.wav|97|The figures are bad, but not that bad.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_288.wav|36|Do I think about them often ?
DUMMY2/p286/p286_092.wav|63|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
DUMMY2/p238/p238_434.wav|37|They can now see the rewards for working hard at the game.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_359.wav|63|Many of these properties are located in the south of England.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_081.wav|65|Over one million people have been forced from their homes.)
DUMMY2/p306/p306_332.wav|12|He made no big mistakes.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_114.wav|25|This is a step backwards.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_280.wav|19|One thing is sure.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_439.wav|8|Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_027.wav|95|It's not going to work out that way.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_274.wav|78|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_379.wav|2|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_403.wav|36|The casualties were not named.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_177.wav|56|Everyone can have their opinion.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_377.wav|66|One policeman was killed.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_155.wav|60|First meeting was next week.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_059.wav|4|I am delighted for Simon.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_056.wav|7|They had been in Scotland on exercise.)
DUMMY2/p298/p298_336.wav|68|Thankfully, we have started to listen to our customers.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_152.wav|47|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_111.wav|48|Instead, another depression came in.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_235.wav|54|I think we have a very strong case.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_129.wav|26|The move has provoked a mixed response.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_125.wav|40|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_216.wav|10|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_153.wav|48|That's what happened against Ayr.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_145.wav|33|It's just a fact.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_164.wav|42|It's always the same, isn't it?
DUMMY2/p265/p265_191.wav|73|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_287.wav|73|There is no openness.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_029.wav|100|Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_216.wav|60|But sometimes it was even worse.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_073.wav|17|The Commons is too outdated.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_094.wav|5|I saw the whole thing.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_300.wav|102|We agreed to disagree.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_091.wav|48|Is it worth it ?
DUMMY2/p363/p363_073.wav|6|It was just an accident.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_003.wav|65|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  )
DUMMY2/p232/p232_140.wav|96|He is severe.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_295.wav|53|The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_196.wav|25|The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_214.wav|10|The move follows a review of the Singapore

DUMMY2/p335/p335_350.wav|49|He refused to discuss his imminent retiral.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_302.wav|41|I did not name it.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_261.wav|66|That's what it's all about, isn't it?
DUMMY2/p261/p261_400.wav|100|It was fit for royalty.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_063.wav|49|I've learned from my mistakes.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_148.wav|90|I was so nervous.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_285.wav|42|Finally, they have a journey back to their youth.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_138.wav|63|Which can happen any time.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_272.wav|61|This is a big club.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_242.wav|57|He says that he is no different from any other man.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_240.wav|77|He would not impose a fine.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_449.wav|8|The budget was too low for that.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_173.wav|9|One season, they might do well.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_200.wav|81|There was an e-mail.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_164.wav|60|It is a new company for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_278.wav|61|The warning is timely.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_082.wav|48|Labour has replaced the Tories as the party of the family.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_210.wav|102|The next time he saw her, she was a different person.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_397.wav|97|What's the theme?
DUMMY2/p293/p293_288.wav|23|Police have refused to name the couple involved.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_099.wav|91|Anyone remaining after that will be targeted.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_358.wav|3|Something is going to have to give.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_258.wav|83|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_029.wav|31|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_221.wav|65|Britain will be little affected.)
DUMMY2/p244/p244_248.wav|78|Is it in the right place ?
DUMMY2/p261/p261_258.wav|100|We will listen to any suggestion.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_328.wav|94|We are a peaceful people.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_248.wav|36|It is set in Paris.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_039.wav|50|Mr Blair last night attended his weekly audience with the Queen.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_192.wav|39|It makes no influence on the public.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_006.wav|28|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_189.wav|52|The story was not made public by this club.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_031.wav|62|This is excellent news for the workforce.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_130.wav|65|That will bring about a dramatic improvement.)
DUMMY2/p339/p339_225.wav|18|We are looking to the future.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_101.wav|5|Oil embargo endorsed.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_149.wav|96|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_272.wav|74|That was our mission.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_261.wav|83|He has not created a Festival resource.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_057.wav|11|It is simple, really.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_149.wav|68|I expected these kind of questions.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_212.wav|42|THE atmosphere was electric.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_160.wav|71|"This year, this month, will be special for Torrance."
DUMMY2/p227/p227_265.wav|29|And they were being paid ?
DUMMY2/p245/p245_108.wav|59|Who would have?
DUMMY2/p292/p292_373.wav|13|This is a big, big win.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_307.wav|1|The festival idea has been a great success.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_064.wav|26|That was the easy election.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_246.wav|69|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_322.wav|3|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_088.wav|83|They lived for their children.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_186.wav|80|It should be easy.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_326.wav|76|For a few years we had good fun.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_256.wav|107|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
DUMMY2/p273/p273_017.wav|56|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_024.wav|66|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_462.wav|95|Let that be their memorial.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_133.wav|39|They have to come clean.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_273.wav|92|In fact, it was almost as if it was expected.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_069.wav|64|This is a big, big win.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_344.wav|46|It is very much a matter for them.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_195.wav|41|The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_087.wav|36|He liked the weather, the courses, the food.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_263.wav|54|We can only go up.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_433.wav|48|He was released after treatment.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_176.wav|13|There is no way to do this.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_250.wav|46|Nothing is being offered in exchange.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_418.wav|32|George is on a two-day visit to Scotland.)
DUMMY2/p270/p270_189.wav|8|They bought the property four years ago.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_099.wav|83|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_168.wav|63|We did what we had to do.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_243.wav|44|How can they engage with the work?
DUMMY2/p266/p266_244.wav|20|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_110.wav|36|That is the only way forward.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_223.wav|89|Until they came to do it.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_145.wav|45|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_074.wav|5|Today she has been released.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_189.wav|105|Last night was a key episode.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_361.wav|10|But we welcome this document.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_391.wav|70|It will take place in July.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_185.wav|2|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_069.wav|48|He will need that machine.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_346.wav|103|Later they changed their minds.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_219.wav|67|Saddam Hussein is a devil.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_325.wav|48|It wasn't about her singing, though.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_187.wav|92|He was born in London of Scottish parents.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_272.wav|87|I came up through the ranks.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_237.wav|106|She died at her home.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_319.wav|90|Henman has been warned.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_325.wav|2|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_059.wav|5|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_366.wav|54|But it was for charity, just a bit of fun.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_311.wav|74|That is why we are here.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_302.wav|50|It could well be military.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_331.wav|77|Are they free ?
DUMMY2/p336/p336_329.wav|98|We'll see what happens.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_076.wav|95|He is a young man with a new deal.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_253.wav|38|I'm getting back up there now.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_284.wav|9|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_257.wav|8|I was just getting over the time difference.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_338.wav|97|The sleeper was six hours late.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_345.wav|83|As, indeed, they would be.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_445.wav|63|There were no formal announcements.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_341.wav|77|The problems began a long time ago.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_068.wav|89|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_409.wav|63|They were a lovely family.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_385.wav|92|We did not want an absentee landlord.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_249.wav|31|The perception is that we do not care about social issues.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_291.wav|4|Shelter also supports the reform.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_392.wav|24|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_346.wav|91|At this level, you have all to perform well.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_255.wav|88|This is as bad as it gets.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_067.wav|54|This wasn't just a big crowd.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_090.wav|102|What happens when the funding is exhausted.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_351.wav|44|An internal inquiry was launched into the procedures.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_037.wav|26|President Bush is at war.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_040.wav|10|This will get their attention.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_114.wav|77|We have a training class.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_153.wav|28|It will benefit a lot of people.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_124.wav|48|He was just a journalist.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_078.wav|18|Maybe he will act again.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_146.wav|98|He was always nice to me.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_026.wav|107|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_166.wav|95|Was it the wife ?
DUMMY2/p265/p265_096.wav|73|Oil embargo endorsed.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_038.wav|97|We see little sign of improvement.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_343.wav|53|Getting that balance right can be very difficult.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_361.wav|103|There was support from across the board.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_145.wav|98|He has been banned from the Salmon Inn.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_274.wav|40|It's so awful.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_314.wav|24|The circumstances have changed since last year.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_038.wav|94|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_379.wav|33|My heart is not so sure.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_229.wav|48|Kingfisher reports interim figures tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_043.wav|93|President Bush is at war.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_336.wav|21|The service from the other players was super.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_434.wav|32|This is a limited market.)
DUMMY2/p265/p265_139.wav|73|I was stunned.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_294.wav|44|The Devil is the creator of weapons.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_088.wav|48|So what happens next ?
DUMMY2/p295/p295_039.wav|92|I think he was nervous to begin with.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_309.wav|97|No other country has ever won this tournament.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_177.wav|97|We've come from a long way back.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_107.wav|10|I was just appalled at the way they behaved.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_103.wav|26|He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_285.wav|92|The Old Firm are going nowhere.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_228.wav|88|Is it a warning to parents?
DUMMY2/p339/p339_011.wav|18|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_100.wav|81|May not have been at fault?
DUMMY2/p347/p347_216.wav|46|This process of attrition is expected to continue.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_329.wav|100|The City welcomed the numbers.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_256.wav|69|This is a question of Islam.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_401.wav|2|What was the difference between them?
DUMMY2/p276/p276_018.wav|106|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_396.wav|29|It is a terrible equation.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_161.wav|92|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_327.wav|66|It was chaotic and frightening.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_255.wav|89|We shall rely on human beings.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_283.wav|36|I realised I was lucky to have it.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_364.wav|34|However, who could have predicted this result?
DUMMY2/p287/p287_192.wav|77|I can't play the game for them.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_241.wav|33|They want to play in the World Cup.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_128.wav|17|They don't have to, but they normally do.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_112.wav|56|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_038.wav|15|Was this a new event?
DUMMY2/p270/p270_187.wav|8|They receive a high profile in the media.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_216.wav|23|A web site's planned for November.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_199.wav|3|I could not sit in the stands.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_234.wav|51|Of further privacy, he had no need.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_353.wav|9|But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_002.wav|20|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_023.wav|22|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_274.wav|18|However, it is going to happen.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_222.wav|13|It's up to the defence team.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_046.wav|0|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_354.wav|63|It was a terrible combination of factors.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_405.wav|51|You name it, they have it.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_236.wav|84|I can't wait to meet him.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_282.wav|104|For some, it might not make too much difference.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_250.wav|48|I've come here for the jersey.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_158.wav|29|It is difficult to say.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_410.wav|103|He also admitted possessing a firearm.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_103.wav|89|But I was wrong.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_301.wav|34|However, many questions remained unanswered.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_113.wav|96|It's not fair.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_033.wav|65|It felt right for me.)
DUMMY2/p277/p277_054.wav|89|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_239.wav|44|I think in three dimensions.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_147.wav|62|I've never regretted coming here.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_061.wav|66|Sex is fun?
DUMMY2/p294/p294_238.wav|104|They will do nothing for the local people.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_302.wav|23|It will vote with the US.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_280.wav|13|That never happens in real life.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_255.wav|15|We are in a very strong position.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_041.wav|86|It was ugly.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_253.wav|93|It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_249.wav|9|Of further privacy, he had no need.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_132.wav|14|Which can happen any time.)
DUMMY2/p273/p273_138.wav|56|It would seem a natural progression.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_175.wav|103|It is highly unlikely.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_197.wav|16|It was worth a photograph.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_105.wav|2|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_050.wav|18|It is a hard act to follow, the Winning act.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_303.wav|55|Tomorrow will be my last.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_203.wav|30|They could take the result away from them, couldn't they.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_066.wav|82|That is part of athletics.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_165.wav|20|I haven't had a lesson in four years.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_219.wav|78|THE force is with them.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_250.wav|15|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_389.wav|32|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.)
DUMMY2/p268/p268_163.wav|87|He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_123.wav|50|It was not a finale he would want to remember.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_332.wav|40|Who will do it?
DUMMY2/p279/p279_240.wav|25|It's too much work.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_159.wav|80|It was by the numbers.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_261.wav|91|We're not travel agents.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_282.wav|84|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_337.wav|6|I just had to go for it.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_359.wav|38|It gave no further details.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_147.wav|19|We haven't found out anything different.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_246.wav|44|There are just two tournaments remaining.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_303.wav|81|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_074.wav|17|Overall, though, it has been a pretty good week.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_160.wav|46|We have not had a formal request.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_027.wav|19|This year it will be Billy Crystal.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_107.wav|84|Everyone had to play the game.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_019.wav|59|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_406.wav|40|The package was expected to be launched within the next three months.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_076.wav|14|The spirit in the dressing room is tremendous.)
DUMMY2/p347/p347_204.wav|46|He is only now regaining his confidence.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_264.wav|27|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_297.wav|69|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_162.wav|76|The General Election is all to play for.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_216.wav|103|We are opening an inquiry.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_245.wav|38|Is that Titanic?
DUMMY2/p360/p360_082.wav|60|We never publicise it.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_308.wav|100|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_319.wav|41|The police have to act to help them.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_146.wav|39|Any success would have been an improvement.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_110.wav|1|The money is not really our concern.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_358.wav|41|It is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_198.wav|96|The conference is the first test.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_311.wav|15|This is the only problem with the story.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_375.wav|37|And he goes with it.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_302.wav|58|They were the better side on the day.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_133.wav|95|Lady Thatcher was the only woman with full membership.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_260.wav|55|My goals have never changed.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_189.wav|0|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_065.wav|68|It is par for the course, isn't it?
DUMMY2/p231/p231_407.wav|50|There was an element of frustration.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_143.wav|3|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_178.wav|60|The police have an awful lot to explain.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_307.wav|87|I saw them last week.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_397.wav|54|She had every right to read the warrant.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_237.wav|0|She died in middle age.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_286.wav|28|Sure, this is a very important event for me.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_068.wav|67|I was as strong as a horse.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_111.wav|38|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_246.wav|34|It appears to have been closed down.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_061.wav|4|I don't have a problem with getting older.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_107.wav|70|It was an adventure.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_102.wav|39|I did not have a bet on myself.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_422.wav|22|His wife Margaret was not in court.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_475.wav|14|The chief constable has retired.)
DUMMY2/p298/p298_235.wav|68|I spoke with just one player, but not the others.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_055.wav|52|Andy was a huge influence yet again.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_309.wav|28|They play together perfectly.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_051.wav|31|Mr Blair is the problem in Scotland, not the solution.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_465.wav|32|The Edinburgh audience was able to understand the dialogue.)
DUMMY2/p301/p301_393.wav|91|McMaster had already seen the first part.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_101.wav|13|I've learned from my mistakes.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_249.wav|37|Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_457.wav|89|It is a vicious circle.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_026.wav|10|These decisions are not simple.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_116.wav|46|That is our unfinished business.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_265.wav|88|Israeli forces denied the claim.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_359.wav|106|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
DUMMY2/p279/p279_291.wav|25|She said she could not believe that they had run away.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_405.wav|39|MAN is fully listed on the London Stock Exchange.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_321.wav|15|Thankfully, that doesn't happen that often.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_301.wav|99|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_356.wav|41|New Zealand rugby is totally different.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_184.wav|38|Then came the collision with Sergio.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_459.wav|37|They failed to reach agreement yesterday.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_341.wav|0|It was tough to contain the excitement.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_471.wav|7|Let that be their memorial.)
DUMMY2/p228/p228_249.wav|57|He said he was impressed by the set-up at Celtic.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_353.wav|86|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_141.wav|47|The weather forecast isn't good.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_279.wav|95|The minister is the engineer.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_329.wav|33|The board is currently resolving its differences.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_341.wav|64|Cinema is a communal experience.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_076.wav|7|I first met him last summer.)
DUMMY2/p317/p317_057.wav|97|The father was treated like a criminal, and why?
DUMMY2/p310/p310_149.wav|17|I felt under no pressure today.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_212.wav|55|It plans to return to this field.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_206.wav|94|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_281.wav|90|But I've won both ways.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_298.wav|91|We are aware of the tribunal case.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_224.wav|28|People can get them if they want.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_357.wav|29|Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_017.wav|70|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_037.wav|14|The ambition this year is to improve on last.)
DUMMY2/p281/p281_003.wav|36|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_241.wav|107|There was no safety net.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_205.wav|61|Tommy is not a problem.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_109.wav|50|We needed financial backing to get it off the ground.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_341.wav|1|One person was believed to have been hit.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_327.wav|34|It's such a shock.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_018.wav|29|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection in the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_305.wav|33|He could hardly have been in greater demand.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_383.wav|69|Yet the data is compelling.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_464.wav|65|Scotland needs this award.)
DUMMY2/p240/p240_009.wav|93|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_161.wav|15|Then he did it twice.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_331.wav|59|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_299.wav|74|He's already made history.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_266.wav|37|The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_255.wav|9|It is hard won.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_026.wav|93|But it failed.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_331.wav|92|I certainly think it should be there.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_326.wav|17|Nelson does not disappoint.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_042.wav|39|This work on a marketing strategy would be finished within two months.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_111.wav|5|It would not do any harm to reinforce the message.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_219.wav|56|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_370.wav|75|They will fight for everything.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_391.wav|64|They have not allowed them to defend themselves.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_225.wav|37|That group reported just before Christmas.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_182.wav|30|By social devices, the two groups are coming together.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_156.wav|66|It was to no avail.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_076.wav|16|The party is up for it.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_196.wav|15|That's how it works.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_211.wav|88|I'm looking forward to racing Donovan.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_142.wav|37|The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_071.wav|7|Today it was really enjoyable.)
DUMMY2/p317/p317_005.wav|97|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_284.wav|3|It is set in Paris.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_166.wav|50|You've been a great audience.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_146.wav|105|There is a lack of chemistry.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_032.wav|42|Jack McConnell will be making a statement tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_240.wav|79|Four of the victims were women.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_024.wav|17|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_261.wav|79|What can you do?
DUMMY2/p361/p361_124.wav|79|I didn't think about it again.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_010.wav|72|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_243.wav|71|"I can't get a job."
DUMMY2/p263/p263_372.wav|39|She would take the Farmer to the opera.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_437.wav|50|The growth potential is enormous.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_190.wav|29|This is the time to use it.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_340.wav|67|He did a good job.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_142.wav|94|It's a question of fashion.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_346.wav|7|McNaughton was not so sure.)
DUMMY2/p330/p330_388.wav|1|That would open the gates of hell.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_288.wav|92|WE live in a world of large numbers.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_101.wav|79|He knows he is good.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_317.wav|18|Yet there is hope.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_033.wav|46|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_278.wav|23|This avalanche is just beginning.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_413.wav|103|They have the cash to do that.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_288.wav|94|I saw it at a ruck.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_069.wav|29|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_269.wav|37|It was a bit of a tightrope.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_185.wav|91|You can say he gets a sizeable amount.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_344.wav|102|He was visited by UK consular officials.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_110.wav|44|There was no time scale.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_274.wav|62|It was a new ball game.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_338.wav|66|It broke up my marriage.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_412.wav|106|Recent reports suggested it might be sold off.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_318.wav|89|I was invited to work in Germany.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_371.wav|107|We have fun in our lives.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_382.wav|29|This will impact on us.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_234.wav|71|"We have a free vote on these things in our party."
DUMMY2/p345/p345_052.wav|82|It's a question of fashion.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_126.wav|33|In my opinion, it was not working perfectly.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_268.wav|17|That kind of growth is the important thing.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_040.wav|97|The gaffer was great.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_332.wav|98|There is a problem.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_070.wav|61|We have to be sure that the taxation system can work.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_202.wav|22|There are some serious ethical issues involved.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_145.wav|35|She has gone to the Catholic school.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_077.wav|41|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_036.wav|103|We had a huge response to that campaign.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_102.wav|33|That is not true.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_010.wav|38|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_023.wav|47|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_340.wav|62|We're delighted and we certainly deserved it.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_128.wav|19|What has changed since then?
DUMMY2/p277/p277_082.wav|89|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_131.wav|84|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_305.wav|102|People can get them if they want.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_354.wav|10|Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_295.wav|97|I keep my fingers crossed.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_095.wav|76|Of course we know them, from their work in the theatre.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_039.wav|43|It has failed.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_112.wav|69|Two of the team became ill.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_295.wav|20|Robin Williams is very subdued.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_316.wav|27|My whole life has changed.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_371.wav|1|That's the law of the land.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_144.wav|6|How does it all work?
DUMMY2/p305/p305_232.wav|54|There will not be any charges.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_344.wav|35|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_259.wav|81|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_024.wav|99|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_020.wav|100|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_291.wav|45|Who did the recruiting?
DUMMY2/p263/p263_470.wav|39|There is a similar story for milk and dairy products.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_368.wav|53|It was a goal which came from nothing.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_410.wav|40|We went straight into the bedroom.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_371.wav|29|Not that Scotland can claim the moral high ground.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_211.wav|77|This is a sensible and common sense approach.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_112.wav|27|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_110.wav|29|That admission is not surprising.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_319.wav|76|Why is that?
DUMMY2/p269/p269_231.wav|94|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_351.wav|16|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_199.wav|96|The service from the other players was super.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_441.wav|37|None of this work is guaranteed.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_336.wav|57|It was forced to divert.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_424.wav|72|Public safety is paramount.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_371.wav|13|It's their duty to protect them.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_227.wav|92|We don't have any senior players.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_101.wav|53|We are already seeing some positive results.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_238.wav|47|He's got to go.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_193.wav|84|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_170.wav|83|We should do everything at a stroke.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_344.wav|17|The big issue for us is the review.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_021.wav|81|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_342.wav|41|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_361.wav|56|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_153.wav|92|I try to be open to experience.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_417.wav|15|I had no idea.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_007.wav|78|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_278.wav|106|It was a terrible combination of factors.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_144.wav|8|I have a kind of love affair with Hollywood.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_082.wav|91|However, within those figures, income from overseas visitors increased.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_197.wav|98|Inspections are not the problem.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_349.wav|34|There is no credible official announcement.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_246.wav|8|And he goes with it.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_387.wav|42|Smaller parties have reason to be pleased.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_057.wav|12|England and Wales are likely to pull out.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_218.wav|37|We will try to find someone.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_011.wav|49|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_268.wav|90|It looks as though he will be right.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_192.wav|0|Tony Blair's official spokesman said.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_276.wav|103|I saw them not long after it happened.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_009.wav|85|There is , according to a legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_094.wav|55|The car driver died.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_004.wav|56|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_128.wav|58|I was pleased with my own game.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_112.wav|92|It is reform in return for resources.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_237.wav|66|Mrs Anderson said this one was different.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_315.wav|12|A great deal has been achieved.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_351.wav|50|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
DUMMY2/p335/p335_325.wav|49|Stock markets will be watching closely.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_405.wav|72|He said it was his greatest work.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_312.wav|42|Our number one goal is prevention.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_074.wav|14|It wasn't possible to relax.)
DUMMY2/p363/p363_068.wav|6|Thereafter they were allowed to proceed.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_321.wav|78|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_173.wav|50|I always felt they played for me.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_302.wav|42|I want my audience to be challenged.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_152.wav|1|O, Is there a lot of blood?
DUMMY2/p273/p273_232.wav|56|Stevenson was arrested on Monday morning.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_153.wav|68|I felt really good until Friday.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_318.wav|58|The palace said the Queen was deeply saddened.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_167.wav|28|About the bad things that happened to me.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_115.wav|51|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_071.wav|50|He highlighted a lack of staff.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_241.wav|23|So what's wrong with Scotland?
DUMMY2/p271/p271_362.wav|27|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_338.wav|107|You've been a great audience.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_046.wav|37|Separate approvals would be needed for these.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_186.wav|6|He had an apartment ready.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_112.wav|43|The eye was badly closed on Sunday.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_448.wav|36|That's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_149.wav|8|We will provide immediate access.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_352.wav|82|Three hours later, the man was free.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_056.wav|12|It comes on like a tidal wave.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_297.wav|91|They are the innocent victims.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_413.wav|60|This is not the end.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_011.wav|62|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he's looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_059.wav|105|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_361.wav|84|They have not done so this season so far.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_292.wav|26|These figures are truly awful.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_318.wav|41|He was not a big name.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_192.wav|61|Miller was every bit as happy.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_101.wav|73|I was just appalled at the way they behaved.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_146.wav|8|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_029.wav|93|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_383.wav|54|We're not an employment agency.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_019.wav|105|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_058.wav|56|We will pay their bills.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_411.wav|37|This is a historic occasion.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_016.wav|50|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_010.wav|12|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_080.wav|72|It is bad news for us and England.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_365.wav|45|We do not comment on the behaviour of our authors.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_213.wav|65|It was men against boys.)
DUMMY2/p283/p283_434.wav|95|It needs to be volatile.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_131.wav|57|I felt very strongly that England should have it.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_215.wav|88|I believe it would have been successful.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_218.wav|19|It is not a wish list.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_075.wav|57|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_038.wav|73|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_010.wav|86|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_331.wav|21|He was a one off.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_200.wav|79|On the face of it, this is excellent news.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_091.wav|23|Beyond that would have been outrageous.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_041.wav|62|I shouldn't have put up with it.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_044.wav|26|As she explains.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_228.wav|48|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_398.wav|25|You make the choice.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_006.wav|98|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_051.wav|32|The drivers had an awful lot of verbal abuse.)
DUMMY2/p283/p283_175.wav|95|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_174.wav|98|The support from the general public was astounding.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_065.wav|73|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_197.wav|18|We are going to have a party.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_370.wav|55|The whole system is too complex.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_406.wav|18|It's a matter of balance.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_206.wav|6|The training will take place in Downing Street.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_305.wav|2|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_311.wav|51|Clearly, she says, we would never resort to such devices.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_413.wav|37|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_327.wav|20|There was no time scale.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_241.wav|6|That ignorance is crucial.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_047.wav|68|It was an easy decision to come here.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_051.wav|30|There was nobody on the roof.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_292.wav|14|It was exactly four months away.)
DUMMY2/p326/p326_170.wav|28|The threat to rural areas is real.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_182.wav|54|Not that anyone has actually suffered, for her art.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_091.wav|61|Today I couldn't run on it.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_259.wav|100|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_058.wav|65|What do we do?)
DUMMY2/p283/p283_415.wav|95|They've also enjoyed their share of good fortune.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_075.wav|105|Is there a new way forward?
DUMMY2/p278/p278_352.wav|10|Scottish Newcastle will report its interim figures tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_355.wav|78|This latter suggestion is very important.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_345.wav|55|He would add value.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_265.wav|83|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_394.wav|95|As, indeed, they would be.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_104.wav|103|I'm confident we can turn things around.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_012.wav|57|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_175.wav|24|He was asked to quit.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_276.wav|57|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_148.wav|9|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_223.wav|94|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_060.wav|20|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_273.wav|2|They seem to get away with it.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_030.wav|68|Any error of judgment was ruled out.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_216.wav|15|That is highly unfair.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_004.wav|17|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_327.wav|12|It may also be her last.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_231.wav|100|It could be to do with the location.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_346.wav|73|It's been hard.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_131.wav|6|It is very simple.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_319.wav|84|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_389.wav|96|It has moved on in the last week.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_270.wav|87|In the event, it proved a largely uplifting experience.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_005.wav|50|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_022.wav|41|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_130.wav|27|We work well together.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_082.wav|56|Potions said he would drive.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_004.wav|72|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_343.wav|45|It will be very, very tight.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_125.wav|43|She's got to say something.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_202.wav|23|It would also take time.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_373.wav|75|Everything is now in place for Manchester.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_073.wav|22|Hopefully we can use this as a platform.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_348.wav|7|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.)
DUMMY2/p275/p275_198.wav|40|I have a cold.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_005.wav|19|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we can go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_020.wav|63|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_041.wav|82|You've got to be vigilant.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_221.wav|13|You cannot allow it to go on.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_148.wav|104|We are all very proud of her.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_052.wav|106|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_422.wav|1|It's been a long, long journey.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_122.wav|87|Accordingly, financial restructuring is required.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_283.wav|89|Who did the recruiting?
DUMMY2/p255/p255_242.wav|31|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_405.wav|17|And that started me thinking.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_326.wav|36|The whole family was in shock.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_147.wav|27|I was awful.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_390.wav|14|Glasgow University declined to comment.)
DUMMY2/p244/p244_268.wav|78|It has to be enforced.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_092.wav|38|We already have them, all over Europe.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_402.wav|54|The place became a war zone.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_328.wav|35|I would do away with the dress code.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_147.wav|60|Our players are exhausted.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_141.wav|30|The whole region is in shock.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_177.wav|37|The changes took effect from June.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_445.wav|14|Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.)
DUMMY2/p313/p313_172.wav|76|That is not a position they enjoy.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_107.wav|12|The culture is extremely widespread and vibrant.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_036.wav|9|Was it worth it?
DUMMY2/p254/p254_277.wav|41|It's a way of life.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_382.wav|49|Writing has diminished in value.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_243.wav|7|The transaction is not feasible.)
DUMMY2/p314/p314_346.wav|51|And the reason isn't too hard to fathom.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_336.wav|35|Did it work ?
DUMMY2/p335/p335_286.wav|49|Maybe we expected too much from the fixture.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_181.wav|103|Smuggling is an increasing problem for the Government.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_029.wav|96|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_266.wav|106|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_375.wav|74|It has been a frustrating one.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_191.wav|103|This will be just another tax on motorists.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_417.wav|34|It's been a humbling year.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_049.wav|42|Things start to talk to each other.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_047.wav|2|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_369.wav|52|We have a substantial value of assets on the ground.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_082.wav|61|I first met him last summer.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_194.wav|20|Is that success?
DUMMY2/p226/p226_133.wav|43|She really suffered for her art.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_055.wav|9|This is a step backwards.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_106.wav|87|We should keep this recent assault in perspective.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_054.wav|96|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_060.wav|19|It is not a standing army.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_125.wav|96|I'm so angry.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_276.wav|87|Clearly, they had other problems.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_078.wav|72|Whenever we heard about this decision we protested.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_277.wav|36|It does not work that way in Scottish football.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_180.wav|90|There is no point in looking any further.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_044.wav|58|Today is not about contracts.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_306.wav|57|Kids are terrible.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_184.wav|92|No means testing will be required.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_116.wav|80|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_205.wav|95|Who was she ?
DUMMY2/p244/p244_184.wav|78|It should never have happened.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_021.wav|45|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_212.wav|13|I am appalled by this news.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_208.wav|65|Her experience is certainly limited.)
DUMMY2/p266/p266_171.wav|20|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_151.wav|33|He is walking free.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_377.wav|87|David Murray, the Rangers chairman, also welcomed the scheme.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_003.wav|92|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_246.wav|4|The English are coming.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_392.wav|74|I don't believe in God.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_347.wav|82|I made a big mistake.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_144.wav|86|That group reported just before Christmas.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_061.wav|71|"Four other charges were dropped."
DUMMY2/p285/p285_169.wav|2|I carried on for him.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_167.wav|51|Little Voice is on general release.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_125.wav|57|Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_299.wav|9|She looked so young.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_413.wav|51|Whether this return was too soon.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_019.wav|1|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_290.wav|6|The best team won.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_070.wav|79|We have a strong team at the moment.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_410.wav|39|We shall not be moved.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_388.wav|15|The potential is always in the idea.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_101.wav|24|Are you from the rugby ?
DUMMY2/p248/p248_353.wav|99|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_368.wav|57|I am not willing to say anything about any couple.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_239.wav|74|They are now collapsing.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_268.wav|93|There is no link.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_177.wav|22|But is it ethical to practice in humans?
DUMMY2/p246/p246_292.wav|5|Yet, it worked.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_142.wav|55|That shows the impact it had.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_119.wav|3|No, the equipment is extra.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_245.wav|44|She has a wonderful mind.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_291.wav|81|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_234.wav|54|Ministers received the report with frosty reticence.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_004.wav|100|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_385.wav|72|Clubs can only do so much.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_115.wav|36|Its replacement was not used in the exercise.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_360.wav|92|But that is entirely a matter for them.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_157.wav|98|I want my audience to be challenged.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_266.wav|54|He is a man who lives to work.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_063.wav|46|It sounded awfully like panic.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_130.wav|66|I am now just a bit uneasy.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_231.wav|18|I think we can get there.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_422.wav|75|The fate of the rest is unknown.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_385.wav|94|He denied the charge.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_094.wav|29|Their attitude is all wrong.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_026.wav|88|Our nation has been changed by this event.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_205.wav|89|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_339.wav|105|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_126.wav|91|Tony Blair should get out more.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_217.wav|77|I wouldn't even respond to that question.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_280.wav|94|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_226.wav|67|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_218.wav|105|William Hague delighted his party.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_043.wav|75|Their campaign is in disarray.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_016.wav|21|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_325.wav|47|However, the groups denied the claims.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_284.wav|26|I intended to look for another club on loan.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_278.wav|98|It's not covered by the insurance.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_301.wav|15|It was an insult.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_306.wav|75|Maloney is an engaging talent.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_175.wav|17|However, you have just got to adjust it.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_120.wav|63|The arrangement will avoid any conflicts of interest.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_242.wav|99|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_104.wav|74|So what is the problem?
DUMMY2/p285/p285_308.wav|2|The letters are going out today.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_147.wav|2|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_104.wav|77|I was impressed with them.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_061.wav|49|It's the most beautiful place on earth.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_358.wav|99|We have to be sure that the taxation system can work.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_075.wav|43|Painful, but only because it's true.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_121.wav|11|Paterson was the man.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_013.wav|83|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_228.wav|61|William Hague delighted his party.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_339.wav|46|You encourage them - you can do it.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_343.wav|16|He has to learn.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_168.wav|22|As long as it is possible, we will keep going.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_372.wav|6|I think we did well.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_209.wav|28|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_026.wav|41|But it failed.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_404.wav|85|Mr Forrester reacted angrily.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_224.wav|22|It had a gigantic effect.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_052.wav|39|He looks like an Afghan.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_068.wav|19|However, there is great potential in this right.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_241.wav|75|They said that they stood by their statement.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_170.wav|63|Full back was a bit of the unknown.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_259.wav|80|His contract was then not renewed.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_010.wav|28|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_326.wav|8|Survival is not an option.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_399.wav|76|Actually, he thinks he has had it pretty good.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_246.wav|78|What was the matter for concern ?
DUMMY2/p260/p260_225.wav|81|We were awful.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_113.wav|79|He is a pro.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_285.wav|69|The songs are just so good.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_255.wav|72|It is a great shame.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_369.wav|20|It's now down in black and white.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_318.wav|73|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_227.wav|43|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_284.wav|64|There is something in this.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_245.wav|6|I have not had much of him.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_023.wav|13|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_076.wav|92|But then they scored their fourth.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_039.wav|75|That was the case with David.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_006.wav|55|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_077.wav|86|Even the one she loved.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_306.wav|97|I got on very well with Allan.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_203.wav|100|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_311.wav|47|We want to play at the worlds.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_228.wav|90|The track is currently covered in snow.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_009.wav|2|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_415.wav|39|It was important to win the singles.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_070.wav|7|Even the one she loved.)
DUMMY2/p334/p334_278.wav|38|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_165.wav|84|The attacker has been put in foster care.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_022.wav|47|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_031.wav|15|They responded in the most positive way.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_344.wav|92|But you can go beyond that condition.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_172.wav|68|Stevenson was arrested on Monday morning.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_092.wav|89|By then, he was walking on water.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_283.wav|9|That decision is for the British Parliament and people.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_160.wav|57|There's a sense of excess in the novel.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_099.wav|106|This is equally relevant to the landowner.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_256.wav|41|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_213.wav|0|He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_108.wav|15|I know he meant it.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_252.wav|88|It was a nightmare.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_256.wav|14|It might be sad, but it's a fact.)
DUMMY2/p292/p292_091.wav|13|It was that kind of afternoon.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_389.wav|58|Maybe, who knows?
DUMMY2/p249/p249_217.wav|80|This is a good move for me.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_310.wav|107|Entries for the event are still being accepted.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_256.wav|8|Labour was too busy to respond.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_009.wav|16|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_089.wav|58|The death rates are still as high.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_382.wav|39|They were to blame for the first two goals.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_331.wav|69|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_149.wav|38|He always has been, since his early days with the Scottish Opera.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_315.wav|78|They were not at the property yesterday.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_028.wav|85|It's not going to work out that way.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_477.wav|24|The chief constable has retired.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_334.wav|66|For his opposite number, this was just triumph.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_284.wav|99|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_299.wav|102|They finished second and third.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_149.wav|60|He suffered a broken back and other injuries.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_286.wav|95|Persuaded to change his mind.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_067.wav|7|She died in hospital two hours later.)
DUMMY2/p245/p245_199.wav|59|The second is the reaction of the Hibs fans.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_202.wav|34|She is not in a coma.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_143.wav|82|Scotland, is an increasing concern for young people.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_354.wav|107|She now suffers from multiple sclerosis.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_145.wav|74|He will have to live with his words.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_243.wav|76|It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_168.wav|61|They should stop the bombing.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_027.wav|46|Some will be deployed on submarines.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_107.wav|92|He had a different agenda entirely.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_150.wav|53|Did he trip ?
DUMMY2/p292/p292_120.wav|13|Is my wife a racist?
DUMMY2/p297/p297_268.wav|42|Government must recognise the problems of Aberdeen.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_338.wav|89|Tell us about it.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_381.wav|87|Another casualty yesterday was John Prescott.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_286.wav|6|We have got no money to go anywhere.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_102.wav|89|It is annoying.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_177.wav|40|As we worked.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_111.wav|0|Becoming a father was wonderful.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_296.wav|75|I saw it at a ruck.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_049.wav|87|The latter option was chosen.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_031.wav|46|Bobby Robson called him a genius.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_269.wav|103|Top-up fees are not on the agenda.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_033.wav|95|It's really no great surprise, because the price difference is so much.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_303.wav|31|Our task is to complete the picture.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_031.wav|81|I'd just like to play.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_167.wav|104|It had until tomorrow to comply.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_062.wav|74|It's there for people to look at.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_028.wav|11|We did it in one take.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_060.wav|26|Try to save us.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_317.wav|98|They are a perfectly good thing in principle.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_204.wav|73|I might come back.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_363.wav|35|Nobody else was with me.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_343.wav|52|Getting that balance right can be very difficult.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_036.wav|1|I haven't spoken to anyone about that, not even my wife.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_103.wav|77|That was the first step.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_462.wav|89|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_308.wav|82|I can't say anything about any figure.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_085.wav|93|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_398.wav|72|It would have been a very explosive issue.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_259.wav|90|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_400.wav|63|A review is under way.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_176.wav|30|It should have a health warning - it is addictive.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_009.wav|17|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_063.wav|27|We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_143.wav|15|The problem is not confined to Glasgow.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_373.wav|106|Brown has always protested his innocence.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_045.wav|69|He's just in it for himself.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_388.wav|100|He must have seen the movie.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_183.wav|28|I need them to set my career.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_220.wav|44|You know, he was struggling with his game all week.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_044.wav|42|Bombing is the easy option.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_329.wav|105|We must do something.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_136.wav|22|I would ask the fans to be patient.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_077.wav|38|They follow him everywhere.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_117.wav|8|Figures are not relevant to the strategy.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_199.wav|87|This Patton will also return.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_154.wav|15|Wrong decisions Address in full
DUMMY2/p335/p335_049.wav|49|It is not normal practice.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_163.wav|43|I've learned from my mistakes.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_004.wav|80|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_283.wav|77|It was an easy decision to come here.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_122.wav|84|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_335.wav|81|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_285.wav|33|They chose the latter.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_234.wav|59|It's only fair.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_107.wav|69|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_361.wav|63|I have a moral dilemma.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_370.wav|49|It looks like paradise.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_342.wav|60|The atmosphere was excellent.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_077.wav|90|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_023.wav|80|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_142.wav|5|I was awful.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_293.wav|90|The songs are just so good.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_408.wav|36|There is a solution, she believes.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_245.wav|42|I am sorry to hear this news.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_079.wav|79|We have never been short of volunteers.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_037.wav|59|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_229.wav|14|They all made the European Ryder Cup team.)
DUMMY2/p245/p245_114.wav|59|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_399.wav|103|He is a joy to watch.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_282.wav|64|It was indeed a night to remember.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_209.wav|13|There is a handful of rewarding paintings.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_321.wav|61|I never thought it would take this long.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_257.wav|32|Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise.)
DUMMY2/p361/p361_145.wav|79|She has never mentioned it.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_089.wav|11|Our numbers are small.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_203.wav|99|It's just awful.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_101.wav|72|This is an exciting time in Scottish politics.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_201.wav|54|The actors just have to say so.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_467.wav|32|The answer was up there on the stage.)
DUMMY2/p340/p340_223.wav|74|This produces exactly the opposite effect.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_297.wav|0|The attacker died in the crash.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_336.wav|64|It should have a health warning - it is addictive.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_063.wav|84|That could be a mistake.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_252.wav|81|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_078.wav|75|He was just a journalist.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_154.wav|7|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.)
DUMMY2/p329/p329_041.wav|103|He will never walk the streets again.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_282.wav|100|At first I thought I was gone.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_011.wav|99|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_178.wav|41|The hotel was now for sale.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_127.wav|19|Why is this?
DUMMY2/p304/p304_396.wav|72|I doubt it would be genuine.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_429.wav|63|I never had a childhood.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_120.wav|49|JOHN Anderson, the former Scottish national coach, is still unearthing talent.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_407.wav|10|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_161.wav|44|It's my delight on a shiny night.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_025.wav|49|He was born in London of Scottish parents.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_220.wav|101|He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_412.wav|4|Of course we aren't.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_168.wav|14|Saturday's match was fairly straightforward.)
DUMMY2/p229/p229_129.wav|67|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_246.wav|61|They should come forward.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_060.wav|74|He played really, really well.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_291.wav|53|He would get into any world team.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_248.wav|44|It is the end of an era.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_244.wav|22|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_295.wav|35|It's got to come from me.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_158.wav|90|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_216.wav|57|That will be vital.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_347.wav|17|The new work will begin in the autumn.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_094.wav|22|His female companion was being treated for shock.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_401.wav|92|That is not a position they enjoy.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_081.wav|34|General, You didn't get a modified.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_229.wav|27|I am immensely sad.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_324.wav|12|Our place as artists is to ask questions.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_305.wav|1|They still have the dirty work to do.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_076.wav|57|It's all I can do.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_087.wav|41|There was an e-mail.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_188.wav|105|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_027.wav|51|Her condition last night was described as critical.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_188.wav|6|THERE's only one word for it.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_068.wav|4|I was the trial judge in both.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_162.wav|48|I think the referee was good.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_089.wav|32|The processing plant was closed yesterday.)
DUMMY2/p361/p361_001.wav|79|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_124.wav|64|He said it was the worst possible result.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_477.wav|48|We did something about it.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_339.wav|61|They haven't got a hope.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_175.wav|71|"There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging."
DUMMY2/p339/p339_390.wav|18|He has run a hell of a race.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_313.wav|15|Knowledge is everything at this level.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_222.wav|15|Are you up for business?
DUMMY2/p280/p280_158.wav|52|They let you see the world through a fresh pair of eyes.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_248.wav|91|This is the New Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_147.wav|52|You should feel involved in their lives.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_443.wav|65|We would deal first with the biggest party.)
DUMMY2/p225/p225_158.wav|101|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_378.wav|36|We are delighted at the response from potential employers.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_128.wav|4|It was a bit of a shock.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_125.wav|33|Pity he couldn't produce a winning British team.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_414.wav|105|I have so much respect for him.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_173.wav|19|The stadium was full.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_130.wav|26|The role was perfect for Russell.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_295.wav|87|She is currently the permanent secretary at the Department of Transport.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_340.wav|80|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_155.wav|48|He removed the rubble with the help of passers-by.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_275.wav|39|I've had no discussions with the chairman or the board.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_286.wav|24|What was the matter for concern ?
DUMMY2/p269/p269_001.wav|94|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_126.wav|44|Will they ever reopen?
DUMMY2/p284/p284_148.wav|16|The weather forecast isn't good.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_069.wav|54|Donald Dewar was passionate about his politics.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_001.wav|13|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_272.wav|46|It will be the final push.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_110.wav|30|I hope they understand that.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_063.wav|51|I'm astonished the men were not injured.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_258.wav|30|This meeting is the path to salvation.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_178.wav|63|One season, they might do well.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_153.wav|102|We need some confidence to get a win.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_095.wav|25|This reason is to do with the nature of the Scotland manager.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_048.wav|18|We have to work together.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_300.wav|96|What has altered ?
DUMMY2/p229/p229_352.wav|67|Everything was an effort.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_120.wav|48|Accordingly, financial restructuring is required.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_222.wav|14|The output price index in December was unchanged on November.)
DUMMY2/p313/p313_303.wav|76|I'm sure everyone will be delighted for them.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_087.wav|95|I'd like to see the business case.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_132.wav|13|What's happening to her?
DUMMY2/p264/p264_474.wav|65|I've got to win here to be happy.)
DUMMY2/p261/p261_330.wav|100|You will never get a conviction.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_264.wav|13|However, by then the damage had been done.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_148.wav|51|We've had an enjoyable adventure.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_281.wav|68|What is the Working Families Tax Credit?
DUMMY2/p277/p277_218.wav|89|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_272.wav|27|He was also married with two children.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_245.wav|60|We deserved the draw.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_377.wav|100|I am a lucky man.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_374.wav|14|I got a yellow card.)
DUMMY2/p336/p336_007.wav|98|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_066.wav|6|Lovely day isn't it?
DUMMY2/p335/p335_065.wav|49|He added later, Normally, it's not a dangerous river.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_324.wav|87|It was his own decision.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_194.wav|27|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_071.wav|91|That's just the way the game is evolving.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_195.wav|65|Had this been common practice?)
DUMMY2/p241/p241_091.wav|86|Now the system is right behind us.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_096.wav|40|Meanwhile, the Scottish Consumer Council yesterday offered support for the new Bill.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_101.wav|48|It was exactly four months away.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_135.wav|59|The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_130.wav|57|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_331.wav|25|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_113.wav|64|I'm surprised to hear it from Tony.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_216.wav|41|A career as a doctor is on hold.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_082.wav|79|Workers will now be balloted on the offer.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_121.wav|59|The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_282.wav|28|That was enough for the committee.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_312.wav|100|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_217.wav|38|That period was a struggle.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_392.wav|50|There was a substantial explosion.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_004.wav|76|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_313.wav|22|They scored a goal, but we have to keep playing.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_306.wav|72|He is married, with two children.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_313.wav|35|The casting is as perfect.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_264.wav|30|I'm a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_218.wav|85|I didn't just walk in and get it.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_396.wav|33|You read it right.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_051.wav|103|I didn't have a clue.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_009.wav|55|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_319.wav|60|It won't be their last.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_007.wav|106|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_347.wav|86|I got a yellow card.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_118.wav|51|He would just say it was terrible.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_038.wav|44|It was a crucial moment.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_116.wav|2|Who would be a referee?
DUMMY2/p259/p259_117.wav|7|This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.)
DUMMY2/p270/p270_181.wav|8|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_316.wav|29|This is a big step up.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_280.wav|47|He will address the nation this evening.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_451.wav|63|The jury is still out.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_102.wav|81|They make a selective perception process.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_303.wav|100|Her appeal is to be heard this week.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_371.wav|102|This takes the pressure off.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_170.wav|71|"The release attracted little attention."
DUMMY2/p284/p284_391.wav|16|You had to go and see him.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_114.wav|44|The cold war is over.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_423.wav|85|That is a matter for Mr Graham.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_188.wav|55|London remained the favourite.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_195.wav|55|Which can happen any time.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_078.wav|21|They were at school together.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_399.wav|20|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_133.wav|47|Is that Titanic?
DUMMY2/p308/p308_091.wav|107|He was a crazy man.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_007.wav|21|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_161.wav|68|It's my delight on a shiny night.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_197.wav|43|There was no option.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_396.wav|94|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_391.wav|96|You thought it was a headache.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_408.wav|46|There is great potential on this river.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_113.wav|81|It was the eighties.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_316.wav|26|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_209.wav|78|Many referees are on a hiding to nothing.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_218.wav|3|Last night, the company could not be contacted.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_244.wav|40|I WAS certainly wrong with my prediction of the result.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_248.wav|51|EMI is a prime example.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_055.wav|79|And they removed a Borderer.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_272.wav|67|He was also married with two children.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_366.wav|34|As long as it is possible, we will keep going.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_243.wav|97|It's like English in its underwear.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_113.wav|101|The big issue for us is the review.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_279.wav|65|It would be nice to be involved in another victory.)
DUMMY2/p268/p268_373.wav|87|I have huge respect for him as a journalist.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_029.wav|69|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_307.wav|94|I was the sheep.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_359.wav|42|It's easy to see why.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_142.wav|99|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_229.wav|43|I'd never seen a play about me.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_127.wav|54|How do you respond to losing your child?
DUMMY2/p279/p279_122.wav|25|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_057.wav|0|That way I won't have to do anything.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_129.wav|71|"If not, a deal could take many months."
DUMMY2/p287/p287_129.wav|77|We had to add value.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_164.wav|25|We do not comment on the behaviour of our authors.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_315.wav|61|SCOTLAND has shown the way.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_154.wav|27|The weather forecast isn't good.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_049.wav|94|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_347.wav|106|You just have to give yourself a chance.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_362.wav|41|The criteria were laid down at the beginning of the season.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_088.wav|105|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_392.wav|7|Does it matter ?)
DUMMY2/p227/p227_317.wav|29|It goes back a long way.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_300.wav|100|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_251.wav|35|They showed a lot of heart.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_298.wav|74|This is excellent news for Glasgow.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_333.wav|36|To beat the European champion is quite nice.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_397.wav|74|And rugby fans can help.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_175.wav|16|Everyone can be bought.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_228.wav|5|My wife and family are the support system.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_350.wav|96|Chambers said he would accept the place.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_414.wav|32|That is the ultimate revenge.)
DUMMY2/p264/p264_373.wav|65|It has the potential to be another North Sea.)
DUMMY2/p323/p323_187.wav|34|Without approval, the sport will find it difficult to develop.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_351.wav|48|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_079.wav|50|Both agreed on the success of the event.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_444.wav|50|It's never easy to win an Olympic gold medal.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_468.wav|7|She came to the Highland Show.)
DUMMY2/p300/p300_317.wav|102|I enjoy playing with both of them.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_444.wav|27|However, he held out little hope that the Government would take action.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_048.wav|79|It is all starting to come together.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_233.wav|83|Of course I was tempted.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_210.wav|27|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_223.wav|98|I came here this week to work.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_295.wav|33|She thought she was going to die.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_306.wav|13|His descent was pathetic.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_251.wav|53|However, the figures tell a different story.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_001.wav|61|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_238.wav|68|Nothing is lost, everything is recycled.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_338.wav|85|The air campaign is not over yet.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_251.wav|96|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_134.wav|0|I am just trying to do my job.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_233.wav|96|The track is currently covered in snow.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_233.wav|31|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_142.wav|75|It has become a way of life.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_010.wav|2|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_343.wav|15|Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_369.wav|84|It was as if it was all happening at a garden party.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_205.wav|85|The gap is narrowing.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_136.wav|40|It's not true.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_156.wav|102|This is a foolish idea.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_144.wav|49|It's all too short term.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_298.wav|79|If we don't do it, someone else will.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_131.wav|59|He will emerge as a world leader.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_188.wav|8|That's not fair to the supporters.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_030.wav|72|The likelihood is that it will be negative.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_024.wav|104|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_401.wav|89|What was the difference between them?
DUMMY2/p254/p254_041.wav|41|It is not for any other purpose.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_155.wav|22|I was loving that little girl.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_310.wav|36|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_291.wav|93|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_079.wav|81|Today she has been released.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_051.wav|90|Is a drug dealer?
DUMMY2/p292/p292_285.wav|13|Again the parallel with football can be drawn.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_228.wav|21|It is, however, an unlikely outcome.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_075.wav|80|Painful, but only because it's true.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_371.wav|14|The members have voted against it.)
DUMMY2/p313/p313_039.wav|76|It helped me to get noticed.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_234.wav|36|This will secure the future of our industry.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_279.wav|40|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_082.wav|98|Four minutes later, the show was over.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_245.wav|12|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_304.wav|57|It's not even finished.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_187.wav|52|Highland health board has a responsibility here.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_261.wav|72|The results are sometimes contentious.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_364.wav|82|The Government would be ready, they said.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_191.wav|67|It is the whole package.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_124.wav|54|Women were mostly notable by their absence.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_246.wav|2|We will need to study the report before any decision is taken.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_240.wav|104|We got the guarantee.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_348.wav|33|Money is not everything in life.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_244.wav|37|Mr Blair had done well.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_152.wav|92|We are right at the heart of Europe.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_101.wav|43|It was mayhem.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_241.wav|24|That you can do it.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_295.wav|54|My house was shaking at the time.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_264.wav|11|But what did it matter?
DUMMY2/p259/p259_216.wav|7|Here the picture is broadly stable.)
DUMMY2/p231/p231_193.wav|50|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_052.wav|71|"They had to explain it."
DUMMY2/p323/p323_075.wav|34|That is my personal view.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_020.wav|47|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_204.wav|38|I'm trying to stay open on that.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_245.wav|2|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_093.wav|82|It's about time something was done about equipment.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_004.wav|32|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  )
DUMMY2/p362/p362_345.wav|15|The support of Britain is assumed.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_020.wav|14|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. )
DUMMY2/p266/p266_376.wav|20|There is no signature.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_307.wav|28|Which Scot is likely to emulate his achievements?
DUMMY2/p260/p260_295.wav|81|Who can predict?
DUMMY2/p360/p360_377.wav|60|Craig is a major concern for us.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_367.wav|18|They will fight for everything.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_276.wav|25|They seem to get away with it.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_176.wav|64|He will be judged by his actions.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_342.wav|18|That's why he is the prime minister.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_315.wav|75|And we can do it.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_416.wav|18|We haven't come out of this very well.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_005.wav|64|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_191.wav|62|He never asked me for money.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_094.wav|106|We should all be grateful.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_245.wav|35|I was just a kid.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_207.wav|59|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_333.wav|34|She was totally possessed.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_076.wav|67|I've not thought about it.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_289.wav|59|Sunday's game was not a trial.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_185.wav|44|The guys have really enjoyed it.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_148.wav|60|It is deeply frustrating.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_212.wav|81|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_304.wav|6|Not all women are dismayed.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_102.wav|8|The new system will be marketed this summer.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_109.wav|11|Of course we know them, from their work in the theatre.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_265.wav|16|The system can work.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_071.wav|79|This is a dream come true.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_013.wav|77|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_186.wav|20|What has caused the demise of singing?
DUMMY2/p249/p249_137.wav|80|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_391.wav|107|Would you take them?
DUMMY2/p339/p339_309.wav|18|She asked for the appointment with me.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_131.wav|21|The answer is maybe.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_328.wav|81|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_383.wav|26|Something is wrong.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_297.wav|46|However, consumers may take a different view.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_383.wav|85|Thousands of people were missing.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_379.wav|65|He had wanted to play, but we had to be responsible about the decision we took.)
DUMMY2/p341/p341_221.wav|66|He asked me in a tolerance zone.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_160.wav|11|And sooner than we may think.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_225.wav|31|The attacker has been put in foster care.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_031.wav|31|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_276.wav|83|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_155.wav|83|She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_163.wav|54|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_213.wav|87|I enjoy the creative process.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_137.wav|18|It was on fire.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_304.wav|67|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_007.wav|59|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_357.wav|67|Tell us about it.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_196.wav|10|It caused a lot of upset.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_029.wav|79|The results were very clear.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_266.wav|75|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_069.wav|19|We have no idea what caused the derailment.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_263.wav|8|No production contract is yet in sight.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_370.wav|39|The value of the merger is still there.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_066.wav|42|The police have an awful lot to explain.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_343.wav|44|A quality audit officer has also been appointed.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_181.wav|28|I'm going to help out in the summer, as producer.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_219.wav|11|History is made at the Masters.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_118.wav|87|If they liked it then I'll be happy.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_097.wav|67|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_299.wav|56|The effect was almost magical.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_235.wav|30|But there are problems, such as retraining new staff.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_309.wav|105|It is out there.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_084.wav|36|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_336.wav|98|Was it too obvious?
DUMMY2/p307/p307_239.wav|22|These guys will not lie down.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_139.wav|7|I think he's the favourite, no question.)
DUMMY2/p247/p247_333.wav|14|The people will not be patient.)
DUMMY2/p326/p326_177.wav|28|The Scottish management team will settle for that.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_341.wav|66|If there is default.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_311.wav|57|I am very happy to be here.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_382.wav|11|It is, though the law is not clear cut.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_307.wav|82|This is too much like Scotland.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_088.wav|51|We should do everything at a stroke.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_251.wav|63|She claimed the day was for young people.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_107.wav|2|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_398.wav|40|Whether the High Court will interfere with the sentence is another matter.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_183.wav|62|You're going to die.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_373.wav|15|We should not be complacent.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_366.wav|67|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_216.wav|12|Jimmy returned to Aberdeen, but she remained with George.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_247.wav|66|I live on the streets of Glasgow.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_166.wav|105|You are not going in blind.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_127.wav|38|It's a matter of huge concern.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_382.wav|37|He did not say that.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_283.wav|8|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_476.wav|14|It will concentrate on the Thames Valley.)
DUMMY2/p263/p263_395.wav|39|I was just happy to get my own goal.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_394.wav|77|He put some colour into Scottish history.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_411.wav|60|What she can't have is the money.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_395.wav|48|Venus rejects the very suggestion.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_223.wav|38|If you don't enforce it, you bring it into disrepute.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_018.wav|47|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_391.wav|26|There is a solution, she believes.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_256.wav|34|We are a new department.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_256.wav|11|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_351.wav|8|It was tough to contain the excitement.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_051.wav|91|It was, however, the wrong side.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_383.wav|22|Where was their passion, the power, the feeling?
DUMMY2/p256/p256_212.wav|90|It had all been arranged.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_239.wav|15|But the killing will continue.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_350.wav|10|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_442.wav|39|There is The Beautiful Game to write.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_092.wav|17|I don't know why she is not here.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_335.wav|10|And he goes with it.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_288.wav|33|It is giving out the wrong message.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_200.wav|29|I guess I was lucky, though.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_184.wav|18|We know that from recent experience.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_246.wav|5|I should think so, too.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_220.wav|98|His contract was then not renewed.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_078.wav|34|The protest will go ahead as planned.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_318.wav|60|I have learned a lot.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_302.wav|85|If we live forever, can we really be said to live?
DUMMY2/p313/p313_231.wav|76|It was a stunning strike.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_203.wav|107|They could take the result away from them, couldn't they.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_201.wav|81|Tenants will be unable to defend themselves.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_420.wav|74|It was one New Year.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_005.wav|15|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_012.wav|46|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_186.wav|4|There will be no change in government.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_107.wav|15|The task is enormous.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_120.wav|1|Who, then, is going to be captain of Europe?
DUMMY2/p312/p312_384.wav|62|It was only logical to end it.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_038.wav|64|Too many factors are now working against him.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_301.wav|27|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_043.wav|62|I think it must be the uniforms.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_329.wav|35|We are on a four-year mission.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_045.wav|3|All businesses continue to trade.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_402.wav|48|I have received no explanation.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_326.wav|94|It's about my time as a guitarist.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_233.wav|58|I think however, he was having a fit!
DUMMY2/p259/p259_206.wav|7|In due course we will make an announcement.)
DUMMY2/p231/p231_100.wav|50|No, the equipment is extra.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_397.wav|11|You can't have both.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_088.wav|11|Now it has been eclipsed.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_290.wav|80|I do not think this family will ever get over this.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_479.wav|48|Manager Neil Cooper revealed yesterday.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_156.wav|1|Audacious decisions were taken early on.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_408.wav|19|I want to keep him.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_126.wav|94|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_195.wav|85|We shall not be moved.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_206.wav|57|They are in the euro.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_010.wav|48|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_082.wav|42|Things were so intense in the studio.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_117.wav|64|That left a bad taste in my mouth.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_433.wav|106|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_014.wav|58|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_375.wav|87|He added, We are not prepared for war.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_021.wav|59|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_246.wav|51|However, civil rights campaigners welcomed the ruling.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_013.wav|52|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_013.wav|81|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_261.wav|103|That kind of growth is the important thing.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_029.wav|90|There's a story, too.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_054.wav|82|We will be paying agency rates.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_188.wav|19|His manager blamed the referee.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_091.wav|17|He also called in at another farm.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_159.wav|85|I am prepared to step down.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_469.wav|39|I just got under the ball a bit.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_242.wav|89|I can't get a job.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_239.wav|106|What do they want us to do ?
DUMMY2/p360/p360_402.wav|60|There is so much at stake.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_162.wav|19|The General Election is all to play for.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_281.wav|10|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_370.wav|65|Neither had any other career.)
DUMMY2/p229/p229_270.wav|67|They are never here.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_420.wav|42|Yet the consensus is, it's worth it.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_074.wav|106|He phoned the number in the brochure.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_243.wav|103|There is no change in our position.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_041.wav|13|She does not see anything ever changing.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_066.wav|90|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_230.wav|3|He intends to restart in the spring.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_402.wav|50|It is a large number.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_048.wav|23|Ferguson must take the blame.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_099.wav|39|Officers recovered a second body in the area.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_010.wav|80|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_167.wav|20|We try to keep it right.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_283.wav|15|But it didn't bother me.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_376.wav|55|We have no information on Iraq.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_361.wav|0|They have created a business.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_364.wav|47|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_026.wav|6|Everyone is taking a breath and waiting.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_402.wav|89|Emotions were complex.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_259.wav|0|No production contract is yet in sight.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_130.wav|53|I could live without the attention, he admitted.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_111.wav|54|It's the way we go about it.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_143.wav|69|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_051.wav|0|The City welcomed the brighter outlook.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_025.wav|37|Smoking is also very important.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_083.wav|80|Even the one she loved.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_245.wav|92|Saturday's match was fairly straightforward.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_042.wav|58|If you look at the beginning of Alien.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_029.wav|62|Blood samples were taken.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_374.wav|16|Now, though, he has an incentive.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_144.wav|102|Since then, my life has been turned upside down.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_142.wav|106|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_317.wav|46|The red card was okay.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_085.wav|89|Even the one she loved.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_415.wav|50|I remain a buyer of the shares.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_083.wav|49|We aim to put them out of business.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_102.wav|97|For now, though, my future is with Rangers.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_199.wav|52|There was no way back for Rangers after that blow.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_147.wav|18|Hopefully we can put in a performance.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_287.wav|85|Who is to benefit from this change?
DUMMY2/p239/p239_095.wav|48|It was fun, but not a living.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_369.wav|25|He has the edge.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_196.wav|30|To which the only answer is, don't hold your breath.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_065.wav|67|It is like a river running by my home.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_302.wav|64|A review of the decision is being sought.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_243.wav|10|My wife and family are the support system.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_097.wav|24|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
DUMMY2/p317/p317_178.wav|97|A lot of things can go wrong.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_169.wav|28|It was a great team effort.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_210.wav|101|Scotland will play its part.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_389.wav|49|It's about my time as a guitarist.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_123.wav|21|Well, the big day has arrived.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_331.wav|17|Then we will face the Danish champions.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_096.wav|92|We recognise it as a key area.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_185.wav|82|Death is outside the language.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_219.wav|14|Is it in the right place ?)
DUMMY2/p258/p258_026.wav|26|It's nice to hear.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_256.wav|92|We should keep this recent assault in perspective.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_200.wav|18|I'm very happy that it exploded.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_085.wav|77|It was clear on Thursday.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_364.wav|2|The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_309.wav|106|Our destiny is in our own hands.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_190.wav|3|In light of things, I think I made the right decision.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_296.wav|46|Raised the way you want it.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_459.wav|39|It goes with the job.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_165.wav|15|We go back a long way.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_182.wav|45|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_250.wav|18|It was not like that at all.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_256.wav|66|Mind you, who wouldn't?
DUMMY2/p255/p255_278.wav|31|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_232.wav|28|Well, there is a bed.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_332.wav|49|As long as it is possible, we will keep going.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_022.wav|43|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_223.wav|16|My wife and family are the support system.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_049.wav|71|"A recording contract is on the horizon."
DUMMY2/p234/p234_300.wav|3|And it was this one.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_122.wav|32|He said to give a local injection.)
DUMMY2/p267/p267_412.wav|0|My aim is a top six finish.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_208.wav|90|It's like a garage.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_347.wav|57|She is free.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_301.wav|59|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_298.wav|59|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_010.wav|99|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_345.wav|77|The airport was even different.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_141.wav|58|Sean Connery did not disappoint.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_348.wav|17|The written judgment was issued in printed form.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_346.wav|37|His third goal was superb.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_045.wav|16|Among them are many criminals.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_165.wav|107|However, the referee was not in the giving vein.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_369.wav|48|They are the innocent victims.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_220.wav|30|Appointed general secretary last September.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_155.wav|30|We did not want an absentee landlord.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_395.wav|97|It's a long-term solution.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_285.wav|81|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_122.wav|42|I saw the other car coming, but could do nothing.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_347.wav|53|And the top prize draw award is certainly impressive.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_242.wav|103|I leave tonight for England.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_153.wav|43|That group reported just before Christmas.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_360.wav|27|It is a memorial.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_082.wav|78|Do I have a favourite ?
DUMMY2/p262/p262_302.wav|45|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_152.wav|17|Last night, however, other experts were cautious about the claim.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_203.wav|83|It was worth a photograph.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_338.wav|63|The letters are going out today.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_012.wav|14|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. )
DUMMY2/p258/p258_012.wav|26|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_239.wav|82|Three weeks later, he resigned.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_045.wav|97|She had travelled to Spain to give evidence.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_100.wav|7|It was clear on Thursday.)
DUMMY2/p269/p269_382.wav|94|He could not be contacted for further comment yesterday.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_354.wav|19|Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_045.wav|20|Among them are many criminals.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_161.wav|36|The strong pound also took its toll.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_310.wav|19|And we have beaten them before.
