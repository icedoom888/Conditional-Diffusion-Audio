DUMMY2/p314/p314_380.wav|51|Even though the show is seriously exacting, physically demanding.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_011.wav|40|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_058.wav|61|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_017.wav|13|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_401.wav|1|WHAT's in a name in this, the age of the Internet?
DUMMY2/p339/p339_219.wav|18|The quality of work is very impressive.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_299.wav|15|We know the goals will come.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_286.wav|16|This is a national crisis.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_027.wav|11|The game today is certainly different.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_273.wav|63|The capital costs are modest.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_207.wav|105|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_256.wav|29|She took them for a term.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_199.wav|67|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_147.wav|64|I'm thinking, what would be easier?
DUMMY2/p303/p303_348.wav|44|I can appear to be nice and lovely.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_232.wav|72|The truth is, it is somewhere in the middle.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_042.wav|8|Merger would be entirely logical.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_160.wav|34|It's the best of both worlds.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_220.wav|22|All the lads are totally focused on that.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_410.wav|35|The second goal was superb.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_012.wav|80|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_347.wav|29|I've got a sense of humour, too.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_285.wav|68|They are so easy for youngsters to open.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_219.wav|95|We always felt we could win.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_127.wav|50|This should begin in October.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_380.wav|41|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_250.wav|32|He would not impose a fine.)
DUMMY2/p316/p316_303.wav|85|Sometimes you stand on them as they collapse.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_265.wav|91|He was telling me to keep quiet.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_293.wav|89|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_082.wav|74|It is time to be realistic.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_221.wav|14|We used to live with dignity in our country.)
DUMMY2/p232/p232_172.wav|96|They thought they had found a home.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_133.wav|77|I would relish the prospect.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_063.wav|25|Sadly, it can't.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_444.wav|106|I might also completely change the routine.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_314.wav|91|It sounds a bit of an own goal.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_163.wav|7|The weather forecast isn't good.)
DUMMY2/p345/p345_112.wav|82|He had a moustache.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_289.wav|61|She failed in her action.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_070.wav|75|He was seen as the enemy.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_055.wav|98|We said, What do you mean?
DUMMY2/p259/p259_352.wav|7|There will be good prospects ahead.)
DUMMY2/p264/p264_245.wav|65|I go home only once.)
DUMMY2/p232/p232_292.wav|96|The attacker died in the crash.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_243.wav|41|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_196.wav|81|There was no safety net.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_203.wav|74|He had been on holiday visiting his grandmother.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_221.wav|1|I didn't want to fall out with anyone.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_373.wav|19|Frank Warren is a great man.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_028.wav|86|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_207.wav|97|Two charges of threatening crew members were dropped.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_268.wav|1|But, clearly, it is crucial to understand that point.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_260.wav|72|It was a policy they were against.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_408.wav|24|Offence to the herd was not easily overlooked.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_059.wav|23|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_263.wav|56|Her body has never been found.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_190.wav|88|The state is controlled by the left.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_290.wav|12|This is a young team, you know.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_244.wav|32|Three weeks later, he resigned.)
DUMMY2/p227/p227_058.wav|29|Do I have a favourite ?
DUMMY2/p310/p310_130.wav|17|Now, though, he is back playing superbly for Blackburn.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_097.wav|55|We are already seeing some positive results.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_340.wav|107|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_166.wav|72|What has changed?
DUMMY2/p244/p244_339.wav|78|Like many companies, it is a problem.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_025.wav|96|Johnson was pretty low.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_051.wav|56|So is that it, then ?
DUMMY2/p363/p363_303.wav|6|But they have the sound.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_248.wav|72|He was totally without that form of fear.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_062.wav|7|He hadn't had them for a long time.)
DUMMY2/p288/p288_278.wav|47|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_118.wav|19|We didn't get the supply to the forwards.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_112.wav|18|I still hope to go.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_129.wav|63|The firm also has a construction division.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_113.wav|94|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_053.wav|3|Yesterday, he was busy in his office.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_294.wav|2|I was brought up in a mining background.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_358.wav|94|A great deal has been achieved.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_315.wav|25|They were fantastic.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_451.wav|95|I do not see it as some kind of reward.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_143.wav|48|He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_165.wav|36|We have a budget in March.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_230.wav|58|I believe you may be that person.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_366.wav|25|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_354.wav|84|The group is due to publish its report in the autumn.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_212.wav|37|It is time for confession.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_041.wav|43|It is not for any other purpose.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_120.wav|16|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_292.wav|39|Access has been a nightmare.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_080.wav|58|She added, It is a huge problem.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_118.wav|89|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_197.wav|51|It may be his last for a while, too.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_440.wav|48|It is also very valuable.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_323.wav|42|Davis is very supportive, as a director.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_264.wav|42|That's the last thing they need.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_325.wav|20|The airport was even different.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_231.wav|4|They are just trying to cover up.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_091.wav|106|He admitted afterwards that he didn't know much about it.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_303.wav|20|Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_233.wav|71|"It would still have been a good film, but very different."
DUMMY2/p259/p259_450.wav|7|There is another important factor.)
DUMMY2/p351/p351_248.wav|33|Some were close to tears.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_309.wav|79|Does it make a profit?
DUMMY2/p259/p259_285.wav|7|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.)
DUMMY2/p313/p313_083.wav|76|I've invented a village in East Lothian.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_096.wav|9|Journalists should make him.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_010.wav|25|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_208.wav|27|He had suffered a heart attack.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_038.wav|38|He was a member of the Tartan Army.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_296.wav|95|He looked like a schoolboy.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_272.wav|62|I don't know what he was shouting.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_173.wav|101|But the story of the play is worth a play in itself.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_112.wav|58|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_154.wav|99|It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_207.wav|44|The line-up is a tasty one.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_279.wav|88|He made no comment.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_236.wav|32|Wilson will tell the truth.)
DUMMY2/p243/p243_187.wav|53|Highland health board has a responsibility here.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_396.wav|60|And what do we have?
DUMMY2/p258/p258_310.wav|26|It's certainly different.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_126.wav|10|It was not a finale he would want to remember.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_021.wav|15|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_240.wav|1|A national strike would be dangerous and damaging.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_140.wav|67|They took a risk.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_132.wav|15|I had been hoping for justice.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_143.wav|105|Nobody in the world can get away from him.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_303.wav|36|The rescue package is public money.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_148.wav|24|I had decided to quit the show.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_062.wav|45|There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_123.wav|62|The deadline for selecting the electors is today.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_124.wav|10|This is a frightening development.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_072.wav|67|She died in hospital two hours later.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_420.wav|65|He is very fast all right.)
DUMMY2/p306/p306_084.wav|12|Why did they let him go?
DUMMY2/p281/p281_151.wav|36|The family kept away from me.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_128.wav|65|Eight others have followed.)
DUMMY2/p351/p351_317.wav|33|He will be really pleased about this.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_163.wav|19|It was a fiery game.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_129.wav|17|We stopped at half-time.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_388.wav|18|I cannot describe it.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_258.wav|0|They were back in full training yesterday.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_118.wav|13|We have no knowledge of this.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_154.wav|65|He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.)
DUMMY2/p255/p255_013.wav|31|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_109.wav|89|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_342.wav|31|A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_278.wav|70|You've got to have both sides.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_231.wav|96|I'd never seen a play about me.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_162.wav|59|They will run a mile.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_474.wav|7|Phil Mickelson did that last year.)
DUMMY2/p364/p364_172.wav|88|We must do that.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_010.wav|31|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_049.wav|61|We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_240.wav|46|This is the subway.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_491.wav|65|This operation will change her life.)
DUMMY2/p364/p364_044.wav|88|That is how the Farmer is feeling today.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_013.wav|15|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_169.wav|41|We started to struggle with each other towards the end.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_234.wav|19|Is it the shape of things to come?
DUMMY2/p323/p323_024.wav|34|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_047.wav|97|We then went to see the headmaster.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_181.wav|72|Strathclyde Police declined to comment.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_335.wav|92|If he could have prevented it happening, he would have.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_068.wav|84|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_267.wav|63|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_075.wav|40|The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_219.wav|103|We find this very sad.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_005.wav|30|She can spoon these things into her three bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_035.wav|93|He took me on a tour of the wards.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_259.wav|66|Our system is archaic.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_416.wav|0|By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_135.wav|8|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_356.wav|60|They said that they stood by their statement.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_319.wav|62|We want to know about the policy.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_084.wav|10|Everyone had to play the game.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_090.wav|70|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_143.wav|24|My life has changed a lot.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_352.wav|101|He was then replaced by Ross.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_250.wav|107|And also, whatever he does, can he really win?
DUMMY2/p241/p241_117.wav|86|I joined a group.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_328.wav|93|They had a confession.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_047.wav|47|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_299.wav|52|He could understand both points of view.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_150.wav|92|We opened up and everything was gone.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_234.wav|2|You should be.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_006.wav|90|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_287.wav|67|I saw it at a ruck.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_192.wav|56|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_178.wav|103|It's been very exciting, very challenging, and a privilege.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_045.wav|13|I did not concentrate on my performance.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_201.wav|85|I watch the other visitors.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_398.wav|27|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_167.wav|60|But the action is about to be restarted.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_123.wav|72|It was a privilege to work for him.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_180.wav|49|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
DUMMY2/p299/p299_350.wav|58|The workers said they were treated like animals.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_190.wav|57|Miller was every bit as happy.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_177.wav|53|It's just a different way of life.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_380.wav|33|I am happy for her.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_235.wav|58|I will not be pressured.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_204.wav|93|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_113.wav|19|We played so well at times.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_401.wav|63|Now the life of this orchestra is very difficult.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_022.wav|23|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_340.wav|51|However, we had no failures on our side.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_200.wav|78|He has defended the system.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_326.wav|16|The problems began a long time ago.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_329.wav|63|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_389.wav|21|The body follows the mind.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_308.wav|26|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_365.wav|69|By that time, however, it was already too late.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_294.wav|33|Does it matter?
DUMMY2/p249/p249_213.wav|80|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_416.wav|100|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_266.wav|90|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_236.wav|11|It's not the end of the matter, of course.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_342.wav|5|They should take their mobile phones.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_322.wav|66|I stayed away from the defence.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_278.wav|71|"Who will perform?"
DUMMY2/p240/p240_186.wav|93|They really did a great job.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_298.wav|24|He has not created a Festival resource.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_285.wav|58|You've got it coming Kabul.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_382.wav|104|Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_272.wav|80|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_361.wav|107|They have not let anyone into the loop.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_402.wav|51|Anyway, even if they didn't it wouldn't have mattered.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_069.wav|31|He highlighted a lack of staff.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_109.wav|46|He served in the Gulf, the Falklands, and Northern Ireland.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_167.wav|65|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.)
DUMMY2/p304/p304_018.wav|72|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_100.wav|70|It is a love affair.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_069.wav|24|Only water is currently allowed.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_109.wav|27|He takes the job.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_448.wav|89|The whole region is in shock.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_247.wav|54|They were at her bedside when she died.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_105.wav|82|If not, a deal could take many months.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_379.wav|24|The countryside is in crisis.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_234.wav|99|They should come forward.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_454.wav|24|The removal would take place in France.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_192.wav|24|This could be an amazing attraction for Glasgow.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_459.wav|75|Dennis was not so sure.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_126.wav|4|Everyone at the school is delighted for Steven.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_221.wav|93|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_235.wav|55|Britain will be little affected.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_043.wav|89|Indeed, he does.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_294.wav|7|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.)
DUMMY2/p306/p306_142.wav|12|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_466.wav|39|They're just a good retailer.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_107.wav|13|That, however, is the end of the good news.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_068.wav|75|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_393.wav|98|The truth is he probably doesn't.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_122.wav|69|It is rubbish.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_048.wav|47|It will come all right.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_094.wav|46|The thing is to recognise that chance.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_014.wav|101|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_113.wav|33|What's the problem?
DUMMY2/p232/p232_290.wav|96|I saw it at a ruck.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_275.wav|105|Police were called to the ground and interviewed a number of people.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_210.wav|50|It was worth a photograph.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_322.wav|15|I don't think it's very real.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_056.wav|23|That is our unfinished business.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_171.wav|34|I'm just feeling very tired - but it's great.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_212.wav|7|Do I think about them often ?)
DUMMY2/p333/p333_287.wav|64|There are no plans to change this.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_170.wav|105|My life has been destroyed.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_403.wav|66|She will just have wanted her baby.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_338.wav|29|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
DUMMY2/p333/p333_301.wav|64|I will carry on.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_243.wav|90|It is hard won.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_012.wav|64|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_175.wav|93|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_149.wav|35|However, he was later released without charge.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_256.wav|80|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_272.wav|34|You do not change overnight.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_335.wav|44|Last year, it was ligaments in his knee.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_100.wav|19|They have just got to believe in themselves.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_194.wav|58|Is Saddam a threat?
DUMMY2/p247/p247_353.wav|14|Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.)
DUMMY2/p329/p329_194.wav|103|The Government, however, insists the company is not for sale.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_221.wav|20|Clearly, the stakes are high.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_345.wav|45|It was forced to divert.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_035.wav|105|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_078.wav|86|I've got the shirt.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_083.wav|6|I have never seen anything like this.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_143.wav|17|I think this proposal is excellent.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_256.wav|67|This year I understood.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_270.wav|46|The whole region is in shock.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_091.wav|39|I expected a victory, the pain is enormous.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_150.wav|39|Next time round, it will be different.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_046.wav|53|How do you take them away ?
DUMMY2/p333/p333_280.wav|64|We know we can't rely on you.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_231.wav|99|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_146.wav|81|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_123.wav|14|It isn't a happy memory.)
DUMMY2/p232/p232_236.wav|96|We were awful.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_045.wav|104|They tend to be female and retired.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_079.wav|36|Mini rugby is a great thing.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_043.wav|34|Now they have found out the truth.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_350.wav|69|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_388.wav|96|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_328.wav|20|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_050.wav|3|The strategy is not without risk.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_215.wav|95|It was a bit like having children.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_305.wav|56|I can hardly believe it.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_132.wav|53|He said a review of the planning process should encourage fresh thinking.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_353.wav|10|My view has now completely changed.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_262.wav|74|The attack was totally out of the blue.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_313.wav|100|Tony Blair said as little.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_344.wav|107|I always felt they played for me.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_048.wav|87|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_423.wav|77|In time, may prove a worthy successor to Billy Dodds.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_348.wav|9|The same things will happen with GM foods.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_241.wav|32|Half of young people had had contact with the police.)
DUMMY2/p336/p336_198.wav|98|But who will buy it?
DUMMY2/p236/p236_462.wav|75|It is a crisis, without a doubt.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_227.wav|34|But who cares?
DUMMY2/p261/p261_040.wav|100|Among them are many criminals.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_404.wav|40|Feel the air, the space.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_362.wav|103|There may be some evidence to this effect.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_273.wav|7|I have received no explanation.)
DUMMY2/p292/p292_322.wav|13|Your father was a good man.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_337.wav|13|To begin with it looks good.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_424.wav|38|Sutton is playing as well as ever today.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_214.wav|41|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_116.wav|9|I joined a group.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_265.wav|103|The reason is the thought of Olympic gold.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_199.wav|66|What's the big idea?
DUMMY2/p263/p263_394.wav|39|Theatre is not a museum.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_094.wav|93|He is hungry for success and I am the same.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_289.wav|19|I am not a threat to coaches.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_060.wav|23|But the foundations have been laid.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_178.wav|17|We have the location, which is assured.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_058.wav|15|It is a sign of hope.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_039.wav|14|It depends on the decisions of the member states.)
DUMMY2/p277/p277_114.wav|89|She reflects a bit.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_377.wav|46|It is just completely erased.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_095.wav|6|If they are not, the commission will take action.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_156.wav|94|That group reported just before Christmas.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_105.wav|10|Athletics is on a roll in the country.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_378.wav|40|It is the old story.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_235.wav|57|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_284.wav|27|He looked very sharp.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_161.wav|102|You should be there with six different characters.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_348.wav|103|First is open defiance.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_173.wav|24|Yesterday Abbey National said it had injected further capital into Scottish Provident.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_253.wav|15|So what went wrong?
DUMMY2/p262/p262_347.wav|45|Chambers said he would accept the place.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_074.wav|67|It is a job creation scheme.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_335.wav|27|The same things will happen with GM foods.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_378.wav|68|He has been campaigning for change for years.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_372.wav|72|It is the voice of the survivors.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_295.wav|9|It's a way of life.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_350.wav|38|This, too, could provoke a risky business.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_362.wav|43|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_054.wav|104|What is the point of jailing him?
DUMMY2/p247/p247_400.wav|14|That investment has now been secured.)
DUMMY2/p308/p308_296.wav|107|I've got a young family.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_104.wav|20|Oil embargo endorsed.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_011.wav|21|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_118.wav|32|This should begin in October.)
DUMMY2/p248/p248_080.wav|99|It may well have been.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_057.wav|5|That's the truth.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_203.wav|105|Saddam Hussein is a devil.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_051.wav|94|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_372.wav|69|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_071.wav|67|Neither it is.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_127.wav|55|It seemed like four hours.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_294.wav|43|The results are sometimes contentious.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_180.wav|13|O Neill has delivered.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_276.wav|65|Scots police had been asked to join the search to find him.)
DUMMY2/p246/p246_277.wav|5|They seem to get away with it.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_146.wav|71|"It is not just about pay."
DUMMY2/p263/p263_101.wav|39|Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_185.wav|32|Women were mostly notable by their absence.)
DUMMY2/p274/p274_404.wav|32|Neither man has been charged.)
DUMMY2/p347/p347_336.wav|46|This is the start of a new campaign.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_358.wav|54|I put the drawing down.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_196.wav|68|I don't know exactly what happened.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_360.wav|64|And we're talking Big Money.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_097.wav|84|We have to have a full statement to Parliament.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_259.wav|78|However, the ball refused to sit for the Frenchman.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_100.wav|36|Otherwise, the market may come back.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_012.wav|40|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbows in various ways.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_149.wav|19|It will be about commitment, not compliance.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_123.wav|20|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_392.wav|35|Clark is back on top form.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_020.wav|97|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_307.wav|68|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_359.wav|89|Now, though, he has an incentive.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_226.wav|48|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_212.wav|34|It will determine whether an offence has occurred.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_335.wav|15|Surrender is not an appealing or realistic prospect.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_276.wav|27|That goes back a long way.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_395.wav|19|It is time to fight a decisive battle.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_169.wav|35|On the month the weakness was across the board.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_037.wav|39|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_472.wav|65|We showed some spirit against Newcastle.)
DUMMY2/p269/p269_270.wav|94|They are never here.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_183.wav|66|She is a very lucky lady.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_347.wav|92|Four years is a long time.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_097.wav|100|If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_048.wav|82|The opposite is the case.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_155.wav|61|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_227.wav|23|The report will be launched in Glasgow today.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_142.wav|15|Off-duty nurses were called in at Ayr.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_368.wav|8|But the Foreign Secretary can cope.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_398.wav|56|The project is entitled The Composer in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_035.wav|24|Mr Darling yesterday dismissed the criticism.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_347.wav|50|What form did that take ?
DUMMY2/p323/p323_283.wav|34|We aim to put them out of business.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_277.wav|24|We accept the new rules.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_240.wav|19|Life was like a timetable.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_111.wav|96|He was jailed for a year.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_098.wav|81|It is a love affair.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_106.wav|44|The luxury has been well used.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_154.wav|45|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_010.wav|93|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_031.wav|54|I'm happy to contribute to that.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_270.wav|71|"She looked so young."
DUMMY2/p261/p261_064.wav|100|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_195.wav|45|People acted too quickly.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_334.wav|18|No decisions have been taken.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_399.wav|91|This is usually done by the space shuttle.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_126.wav|26|Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_398.wav|54|Several people were out in the street.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_398.wav|16|It can help.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_126.wav|105|It has removed a bit of guilt.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_375.wav|45|I am a wealthy person.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_269.wav|0|It does not work that way in Scottish football.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_057.wav|54|For example they could be in school uniform.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_118.wav|41|Tony Blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from Dublin.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_112.wav|97|That just wasn't good enough.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_166.wav|73|He deserved the win.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_130.wav|1|What do they pay to join the club?
DUMMY2/p275/p275_149.wav|40|I was awful.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_126.wav|79|He has gone through the process before.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_033.wav|75|This is a central issue.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_120.wav|33|We need to get the right people in.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_225.wav|78|Milk producers were in need of immediate assistance, he said.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_247.wav|30|We have great sympathy with Danny.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_007.wav|55|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_283.wav|41|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_380.wav|19|They were outstanding and thoroughly deserved their win.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_171.wav|42|The property is owned by Glasgow City Council.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_419.wav|76|I didn't play all that well.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_383.wav|106|We played them off the pitch.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_118.wav|84|It's not a new concept in jazz.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_245.wav|9|It's quite a line-up!
DUMMY2/p317/p317_405.wav|97|And our game is about going forward.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_037.wav|37|The ambition this year is to improve on last.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_042.wav|90|Indeed, he does.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_407.wav|69|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_172.wav|4|He was at home with his pals.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_287.wav|27|You feel very helpless.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_233.wav|53|They should realise the chairman wants a deputy he can trust.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_107.wav|107|You'll get on like a house on fire.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_164.wav|103|What if the confession is, after all, a fake?
DUMMY2/p288/p288_379.wav|47|I am a wealthy person.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_217.wav|103|I get to work with very good people.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_141.wav|91|Volvo is grateful to its staff in Irvine.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_148.wav|106|Are you from the rugby ?
DUMMY2/p286/p286_446.wav|63|He had no problems with discipline.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_333.wav|86|Who will do it?
DUMMY2/p244/p244_011.wav|78|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_323.wav|46|But even without either, Glasgow will be outstanding.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_136.wav|49|Suddenly, directing was the thing he wanted to do.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_419.wav|62|There was no pressure at all.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_035.wav|98|It was another good idea.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_159.wav|37|Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_008.wav|103|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_318.wav|67|It's about my time as a guitarist.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_366.wav|35|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_202.wav|56|I'm just a regular person.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_079.wav|100|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_103.wav|18|We should not be surprised at that.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_393.wav|40|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_106.wav|81|Before the game we went for a pint.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_018.wav|88|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_001.wav|5|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_245.wav|19|The truth is otherwise.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_289.wav|87|What are they for ?
DUMMY2/p361/p361_075.wav|79|They were looking for things.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_327.wav|8|There will be good prospects ahead.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_322.wav|7|We will deliver at director level.)
DUMMY2/p292/p292_177.wav|13|Clearly we are looking at this very carefully.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_065.wav|25|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_415.wav|54|She always wanted her own way.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_347.wav|40|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_311.wav|23|Four had been brought down.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_268.wav|88|I have got to keep the lid on.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_074.wav|63|I want the Commonwealth and European titles.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_070.wav|81|Robin Williams is very subdued.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_228.wav|3|Mr Blair was ready for him.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_295.wav|77|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_340.wav|53|Do I have a favourite ?
DUMMY2/p307/p307_252.wav|22|For sure, you won't know unless you ask him.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_484.wav|24|It was a narrow escape.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_279.wav|67|He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_141.wav|74|He was shaking like a leaf.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_272.wav|56|It was a horrible moment.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_350.wav|44|People tended to stay there for some time.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_204.wav|67|Last night was a key episode.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_097.wav|18|The search is due to be completed today.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_260.wav|27|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_041.wav|8|Among them are many criminals.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_254.wav|15|We did not play well.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_131.wav|90|Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_104.wav|40|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_412.wav|65|Financial services also saw a sharp reduction in new business.)
DUMMY2/p260/p260_195.wav|81|It's all about money, money, money.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_110.wav|72|I am just going to go for it.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_415.wav|56|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_124.wav|70|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_459.wav|8|We are over the moon.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_340.wav|83|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_186.wav|92|I'm sure it will go on.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_268.wav|85|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_090.wav|61|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_301.wav|30|Shaking his head, Mr Cook said he simply couldn't understand it.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_138.wav|70|I was dead.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_094.wav|35|You are like an animal.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_448.wav|27|We are certainly moving in the right direction as a club.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_101.wav|16|They tried to deny it.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_120.wav|75|The colours are very pretty.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_119.wav|71|"I was furious."
DUMMY2/p250/p250_120.wav|24|It didn't come as any great surprise.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_226.wav|99|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_296.wav|19|Is being naturally funny enough?
DUMMY2/p274/p274_047.wav|32|I had trouble with the producers.)
DUMMY2/p280/p280_214.wav|52|People elsewhere in Scotland will feel cut off by this.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_053.wav|78|Their campaign is in disarray.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_030.wav|11|And that was just for starters.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_096.wav|14|The woman is basically off her head.)
DUMMY2/p335/p335_391.wav|49|You do that because you want to win.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_061.wav|54|He did the right thing by ignoring me.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_175.wav|45|We wanted it left for a wee while.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_021.wav|33|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_190.wav|102|The children, were not thought to be so seriously hurt.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_112.wav|106|England were ahead until two minutes into injury time.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_440.wav|106|I got a yellow card.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_185.wav|16|It is a farce.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_109.wav|5|It was the eighties.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_051.wav|14|We would have concerns about suspension.)
DUMMY2/p314/p314_387.wav|51|It's about my time as a guitarist.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_066.wav|5|The tournament has now been cancelled.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_367.wav|94|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_227.wav|48|Initial market reaction was close to euphoric.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_102.wav|63|I cannot believe this decision.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_276.wav|32|I couldn't honestly tell you.)
DUMMY2/p246/p246_338.wav|5|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_240.wav|33|Now he is in charge of this.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_288.wav|58|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_316.wav|20|Your father was a good man.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_332.wav|23|Detectives are waiting to interview the men.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_386.wav|106|It must be tough to live with.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_257.wav|104|I get on him, he gets on me.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_209.wav|100|Who was she ?
DUMMY2/p305/p305_090.wav|54|His handling raises a wider issue.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_211.wav|91|But he just carried on anyway.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_096.wav|79|Nobody called me to explain.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_173.wav|32|I'm just going to hit the shot.)
DUMMY2/p277/p277_009.wav|89|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_230.wav|6|He was only doing his job.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_273.wav|104|Boy is the town a mess.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_008.wav|96|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_414.wav|16|He scored a touchdown.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_283.wav|2|Who will perform?
DUMMY2/p285/p285_077.wav|2|All options are open.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_244.wav|3|What was the matter for concern ?
DUMMY2/p362/p362_057.wav|15|He is a law unto himself.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_232.wav|24|It will affect their work.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_198.wav|7|Shelter also supports the reform.)
DUMMY2/p270/p270_417.wav|8|That was a touch of class.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_221.wav|22|He added later, Normally, it's not a dangerous river.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_016.wav|53|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_216.wav|86|I was so nervous.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_389.wav|16|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_247.wav|73|There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_306.wav|24|No-one wanted to run it tonight.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_181.wav|89|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_348.wav|94|It's been hard.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_103.wav|87|There can be no compromise on welfare.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_280.wav|87|If that's the case, he will struggle.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_159.wav|81|These days are long gone.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_001.wav|8|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_270.wav|72|It would then be up to the judge.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_444.wav|14|The Allies intend to maintain the average.)
DUMMY2/p333/p333_257.wav|64|Nothing is being offered in exchange.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_005.wav|49|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_023.wav|1|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_174.wav|48|As if that is an achievement.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_104.wav|88|But he has a lifeline.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_311.wav|16|The minister is the engineer.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_339.wav|21|You have been warned.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_107.wav|98|There is another important factor.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_240.wav|49|EMI is a prime example.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_216.wav|97|There will be plenty to keep them occupied.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_068.wav|59|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_040.wav|67|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_084.wav|17|I am so sorry.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_140.wav|6|Things are going well.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_236.wav|61|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_208.wav|34|Post offices are closing now.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_060.wav|61|New York is expected to come to a standstill.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_028.wav|43|Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_376.wav|91|The home was now under new management.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_064.wav|65|People come to see the Highlands.)
DUMMY2/p351/p351_289.wav|33|I feel it is very irrational.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_409.wav|32|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.)
DUMMY2/p272/p272_235.wav|69|Our policy is clear.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_272.wav|33|It happens from time to time.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_212.wav|67|But we are not immune to the problem.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_352.wav|63|They were impressive against France.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_033.wav|94|He took me on a tour of the wards.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_148.wav|98|Then there is the Mini itself.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_284.wav|46|It's in the eyes.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_016.wav|39|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_283.wav|1|I am confident of the outcome this week.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_080.wav|82|We should be capable of managing it, though.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_202.wav|99|But she might be.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_048.wav|95|Every aspect of our play was first class.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_139.wav|43|I am now unemployed.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_327.wav|25|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_358.wav|55|Is there a waiting list ?
DUMMY2/p226/p226_109.wav|43|Oil embargo endorsed.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_143.wav|65|I told them during their morning break.)
DUMMY2/p360/p360_309.wav|60|Have we not been here before?
DUMMY2/p299/p299_339.wav|58|Barry will be able to handle this.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_130.wav|42|It's unsafe for society.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_119.wav|68|Council officials are involved, along with the transport industry.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_238.wav|74|Is there any prospect of this happening?
DUMMY2/p299/p299_239.wav|58|The casting of her husband was an accident.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_190.wav|33|This is a special place for me.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_214.wav|39|I came home by ambulance.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_277.wav|12|Tourism continues to struggle.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_311.wav|103|Seaman is not the goalkeeper of old.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_257.wav|105|Blood samples were taken.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_288.wav|80|Scotland were beaten again.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_279.wav|62|These were the edited highlights.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_277.wav|32|On the contrary they stand to gain.)
DUMMY2/p351/p351_030.wav|33|He was the Bill Gates of theatre.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_152.wav|4|Now, she has completed a family tradition.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_020.wav|71|"Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. "
DUMMY2/p330/p330_232.wav|1|What happened to me last week was wrong.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_253.wav|34|And that is our first victory in Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_110.wav|98|At Westminster, there was disbelief at the news.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_176.wav|5|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_180.wav|70|Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_046.wav|17|And who would argue with that?
DUMMY2/p314/p314_190.wav|51|No, it's never been mentioned.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_401.wav|65|He plays only for himself.)
DUMMY2/p318/p318_352.wav|19|Two others were also seriously injured.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_400.wav|77|Is it worth it ?
DUMMY2/p313/p313_059.wav|76|It's back to how it used to be.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_073.wav|77|I first met him last summer.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_015.wav|37|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_107.wav|33|- Really you will !
DUMMY2/p323/p323_392.wav|34|This does not create any precedent.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_375.wav|42|This is the same old story.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_295.wav|23|Construction is due to begin in February.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_397.wav|53|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_286.wav|69|The goals will come.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_289.wav|60|Is it on a building site?
DUMMY2/p268/p268_300.wav|87|Aberdeen had little to offer.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_194.wav|35|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_113.wav|31|I'm delighted about that.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_052.wav|2|There was no safety net.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_208.wav|66|Too much has already been said.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_066.wav|46|The crowd was awesome.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_254.wav|49|Finally action had been taken.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_280.wav|78|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_156.wav|74|The wind was coming from all directions.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_406.wav|79|It is truly masterly performance.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_158.wav|4|It's there for people to look at.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_287.wav|41|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
DUMMY2/p254/p254_324.wav|41|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_026.wav|40|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_279.wav|32|He took over our lives.)
DUMMY2/p273/p273_233.wav|56|Will have consequences for Scottish universities.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_236.wav|80|Broke the birdie record.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_149.wav|86|We want to see the maximum of change.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_062.wav|50|Do I have a favourite ?
DUMMY2/p288/p288_408.wav|47|The visual arts committee took this decision in December.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_093.wav|73|May not have been at fault?
DUMMY2/p262/p262_063.wav|45|And if he hadn't become a musician?
DUMMY2/p326/p326_230.wav|28|What is the point of jailing him?
DUMMY2/p340/p340_270.wav|74|I hope he comes back.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_059.wav|36|It was a lovely experience.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_294.wav|60|We are in it for the long-term.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_087.wav|72|He was determined to write a novel.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_082.wav|81|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_223.wav|36|You have got to look at speed of response.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_154.wav|37|They make a selective perception process.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_107.wav|57|It is a good day for the coalition.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_422.wav|48|It needs to be sorted out by Easter.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_348.wav|18|How do we get a bigger stage?
DUMMY2/p329/p329_255.wav|103|I just went a bit too far.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_366.wav|76|The idea was presented to me.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_017.wav|48|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_281.wav|59|He was obviously very genuine.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_317.wav|64|I would welcome a proper, public discussion on this issue.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_275.wav|62|The people here are quite reserved.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_184.wav|65|She really suffered for her art.)
DUMMY2/p314/p314_232.wav|51|The next one comes up.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_345.wav|7|Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.)
DUMMY2/p317/p317_358.wav|97|They should be swept away.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_029.wav|11|I'll take the blame for that.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_192.wav|18|He has made a step forward.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_333.wav|81|It is a job creation scheme.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_255.wav|85|This will be our new beginning.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_372.wav|64|I'll go out and be aggressive.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_361.wav|3|We never played at all.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_284.wav|11|People don't feel safe, including me.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_348.wav|19|On reflection, it was really quite exciting.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_100.wav|6|We talk about effective military action.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_277.wav|81|We are a grandmother.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_369.wav|86|There was no hint of scandal.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_006.wav|72|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_058.wav|82|I've never seen anything like it.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_010.wav|26|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_405.wav|22|Whether this return was too soon.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_290.wav|93|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_407.wav|19|As, indeed, they would be.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_066.wav|59|You need a trademark.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_272.wav|99|He's been here on numerous occasions.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_417.wav|13|I will always remember the horrible images.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_286.wav|85|They use them for everything.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_245.wav|68|She has a wonderful mind.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_249.wav|10|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_151.wav|98|The only answer is a public inquiry.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_189.wav|80|We've got a lot of respect for the Lions.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_324.wav|100|This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_101.wav|95|IT has been the year of the youngster at Kilmarnock.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_204.wav|5|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_365.wav|51|It may encourage more people to prospect.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_008.wav|76|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_464.wav|39|We are over the moon.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_117.wav|18|There are exciting days ahead.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_460.wav|89|I'd love to be like Peter.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_481.wav|7|The chief constable has retired.)
DUMMY2/p255/p255_134.wav|31|We never said that we would walk through the third division.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_352.wav|25|We are looking for perfection.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_387.wav|41|We have to reduce the number of plastic bags.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_039.wav|66|It's wonderful to have won.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_254.wav|90|At the end of the day, one has to be careful.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_245.wav|34|There were no violations.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_218.wav|53|A European final must be the millennium target.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_199.wav|11|Surely, if anything, it would be the other way round.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_257.wav|63|A succession of managers in the opera company resigned.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_312.wav|44|We have the location, which is assured.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_196.wav|63|I cannot say too much about them.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_337.wav|2|went on sale.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_169.wav|8|She returned to the theatre.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_154.wav|6|His body was never found.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_065.wav|36|Only water is currently allowed.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_101.wav|106|We are satisfied with this outcome.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_092.wav|51|He said because people had invited him.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_133.wav|68|He loved his job and working in newspapers.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_127.wav|37|Basically we lost the game because we were outplayed.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_010.wav|96|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_398.wav|0|There were no plans for a rights issue.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_260.wav|66|It was a tactical change.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_313.wav|67|Let's hope it's an investment in the future.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_290.wav|33|We were used to being in control.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_109.wav|64|He served in the Gulf, the Falklands, and Northern Ireland.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_155.wav|74|This is a recipe for disaster.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_163.wav|70|These days are long gone.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_024.wav|80|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_244.wav|69|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_243.wav|69|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_012.wav|78|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_155.wav|40|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_314.wav|9|But it is understood to have happened after weeks of arguments.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_194.wav|33|It is crucial to understand this in context.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_193.wav|100|It had been in place since last July.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_129.wav|32|how do you get it back ?)
DUMMY2/p284/p284_408.wav|16|It is full-scale.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_023.wav|20|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_020.wav|76|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_044.wav|59|But it took a lot of bottle.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_107.wav|48|There could be a way back.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_086.wav|5|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_430.wav|75|We've got a good management record.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_406.wav|51|We are obviously disturbed by this case.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_458.wav|7|Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.)
DUMMY2/p225/p225_175.wav|101|At that point, the structure of the board was changed.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_019.wav|24|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_003.wav|68|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_337.wav|28|Butcher has only one idea in mind.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_152.wav|88|It is an absolute disgrace.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_233.wav|48|Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_444.wav|39|It wouldn't matter if he had.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_270.wav|50|On the contrary they stand to gain.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_276.wav|1|I expected these kind of questions.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_483.wav|24|That argument has been won.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_218.wav|93|Work has started.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_151.wav|41|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_231.wav|44|I fell in love with ballet.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_025.wav|68|It is bad news for the flooded areas.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_175.wav|84|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_458.wav|24|They had learned from the lessons of the first game.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_350.wav|66|He takes time out for everyone.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_339.wav|49|Meanwhile, Rangers will continue to search for a striker.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_002.wav|89|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_034.wav|90|A web site is planned for November.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_236.wav|83|The minister is the engineer.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_192.wav|7|I will have to order its destruction.)
DUMMY2/p262/p262_383.wav|45|The release attracted little attention.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_089.wav|85|The driver escaped injury.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_138.wav|4|We are still the best team in Britain.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_265.wav|40|It's very nice.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_354.wav|74|He was elected as a councillor last year.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_218.wav|84|His third goal was superb.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_079.wav|54|Waiting times for these services are too long.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_139.wav|63|It is the latter which has prompted the warning.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_135.wav|15|No other vehicle was involved in the crash.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_077.wav|81|Even the one she loved.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_385.wav|70|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_152.wav|93|Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_075.wav|32|Talk of a crisis is absurd.)
DUMMY2/p232/p232_308.wav|96|We are in the end game.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_400.wav|34|The Farmer is called an idiot.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_370.wav|93|Hartley should know.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_423.wav|32|This should put downward pressure on inflation.)
DUMMY2/p261/p261_460.wav|100|Long-term, it was the right thing to do.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_046.wav|70|It's the only thing.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_202.wav|41|It's like a garage.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_039.wav|41|They're just different.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_221.wav|102|A world away from Rangers, you might say.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_062.wav|39|Indeed, it is only the beginning.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_147.wav|59|The release attracted little attention.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_005.wav|95|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_280.wav|59|Well, he can do it.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_140.wav|38|We all thought we were going to die.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_040.wav|42|I am writing a novel.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_200.wav|31|It is a farce.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_371.wav|60|I'm working on that one, too.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_200.wav|33|We need to know more about her.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_333.wav|45|It shows a great deal to come back under that mental pressure.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_062.wav|63|We have to keep our clients.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_303.wav|84|One was a lawyer.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_324.wav|86|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_170.wav|13|That will be vital.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_178.wav|77|Being investor ready is a good start.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_007.wav|85|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_157.wav|14|I love the spectacle of cinema.)
DUMMY2/p257/p257_371.wav|105|This year I understood.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_015.wav|23|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_023.wav|77|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_312.wav|34|I'm very puzzled by it.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_005.wav|84|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_189.wav|36|Our destiny is in our own hands.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_140.wav|42|She took them for a term.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_020.wav|41|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_365.wav|9|The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_256.wav|90|The bottom line is that we had to get a win.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_176.wav|85|And you need to be so resourceful.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_020.wav|69|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_185.wav|74|Of course the ending was fantastic.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_236.wav|44|We're still talking with a few people.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_178.wav|92|It was far from business as usual.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_353.wav|65|It's clearly a budget.)
DUMMY2/p245/p245_160.wav|59|We've got a lot of respect for the Lions.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_113.wav|98|It's there for people to look at.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_092.wav|95|By then, he was walking on water.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_364.wav|8|The value of the merger is still there.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_340.wav|104|Downing Street defended the scale of the awards.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_109.wav|56|He thought she was amazing.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_354.wav|34|He died at the hands of his captors.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_374.wav|87|That remains the unanswered question.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_056.wav|57|That's the day job.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_222.wav|85|Look at a computer.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_164.wav|63|She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_315.wav|99|Donald was his friend.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_404.wav|63|Well, the big day has arrived.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_102.wav|59|I have had no social life at all.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_054.wav|20|What was the main difference?
DUMMY2/p258/p258_359.wav|26|But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_336.wav|12|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_385.wav|41|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_038.wav|53|He added that her comments were noted.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_208.wav|46|Who can tell?
DUMMY2/p255/p255_179.wav|31|His team management was protective.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_372.wav|68|There was a battle there.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_122.wav|104|Did he just want to be on telly?
DUMMY2/p277/p277_057.wav|89|He looks like an Afghan.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_089.wav|49|We still don't know what's happened.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_099.wav|55|They prepared some food very quickly.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_008.wav|67|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_304.wav|55|But there's also a love for the songs.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_283.wav|53|He may be ready for first team action in March.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_193.wav|21|Is that not uncanny?
DUMMY2/p243/p243_059.wav|53|We just want this season to end.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_133.wav|83|It plans to return to this field.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_145.wav|7|Why change it ?)
DUMMY2/p330/p330_259.wav|1|Subs not used, Fernandez.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_315.wav|3|They have set the standard.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_027.wav|45|However, the following year the cancer returned.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_420.wav|22|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_316.wav|6|They want to win the title.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_273.wav|64|How much of a cop out is that?
DUMMY2/p229/p229_310.wav|67|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_166.wav|80|It is an attitude of mind.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_413.wav|15|We are trying to do it properly.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_291.wav|86|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_025.wav|93|Johnson was pretty low.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_397.wav|102|A fatal accident inquiry is ongoing.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_380.wav|100|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_303.wav|96|He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_018.wav|76|Aristotle thought the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_399.wav|92|What has caused the demise of singing?
DUMMY2/p267/p267_366.wav|0|It's only a matter of scale.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_207.wav|67|I wanted to put myself on the line.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_035.wav|85|Why you did it will never be known.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_400.wav|23|And this tournament will travel.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_137.wav|19|This performance has given my confidence a boost.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_289.wav|106|It's as eventful as it is momentous.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_151.wav|19|Surely it can do better than that?
DUMMY2/p271/p271_440.wav|27|In it went.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_147.wav|49|It was worth a photograph.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_118.wav|68|We are losing this war.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_308.wav|92|This is your chance.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_239.wav|39|It could be to do with the location.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_256.wav|7|It had so much to do with output.)
DUMMY2/p226/p226_330.wav|43|The weekly average was three hours.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_408.wav|78|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_185.wav|11|She has been unable to work since.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_169.wav|66|I am still very much a director.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_434.wav|65|A job is a job, after all.)
DUMMY2/p258/p258_155.wav|26|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_173.wav|83|In a way he was.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_110.wav|42|A great deal has been achieved.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_011.wav|4|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_071.wav|59|There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_123.wav|5|I just wanted a break.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_251.wav|71|"It is also very valuable."
DUMMY2/p283/p283_360.wav|95|Public opinion was split on the proposal.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_045.wav|26|She looked so young.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_269.wav|92|The airport was even different.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_400.wav|16|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_108.wav|75|Football is a passion for many.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_322.wav|101|Funding for the science centre has come from a number of sources.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_388.wav|17|Last year, however, it was decided to dissolve the abbey.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_182.wav|53|She is believed to be in South Africa.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_106.wav|98|Don't you believe it.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_091.wav|52|I can't remember a lot about the accident.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_180.wav|88|Our children are our future.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_214.wav|71|"I am really going to miss him."
DUMMY2/p283/p283_073.wav|95|There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_357.wav|70|Their time has gone.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_030.wav|61|However, the following year the cancer returned.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_231.wav|56|That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_199.wav|54|Suddenly it was, indeed, a new ball game.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_105.wav|86|Now, though, he believes that the new formation has helped his form.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_224.wav|8|Did he trip ?
DUMMY2/p287/p287_259.wav|77|It is not enough to be first division champions.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_376.wav|10|The parents are not alone in their concerns about the proposals.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_348.wav|69|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_185.wav|86|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_089.wav|20|It is a lifeline.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_353.wav|46|It's a very special unit.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_371.wav|17|Pray that is so.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_187.wav|97|She was eight months pregnant at the time.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_020.wav|31|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_355.wav|41|We will be homeless.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_039.wav|100|Their campaign is in disarray.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_034.wav|16|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_049.wav|13|The racist abuse was terrible.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_035.wav|31|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_230.wav|51|It is a court case.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_306.wav|65|He remains a main board director of Royal.)
DUMMY2/p294/p294_314.wav|104|It is three years at present.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_096.wav|103|Jamming would be equally difficult.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_315.wav|45|We want to play at the worlds.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_268.wav|63|Reaction from Scottish business leaders was mixed.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_379.wav|11|I am not changing my mind.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_044.wav|102|We like being the underdogs.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_351.wav|80|It was very formal.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_157.wav|38|This commitment should be built upon.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_088.wav|17|However, it is no longer with the national team.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_304.wav|69|My whole life has changed.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_100.wav|41|Now the system is right behind us.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_223.wav|7|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.)
DUMMY2/p241/p241_047.wav|86|As she explains.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_408.wav|18|Everyone can have their opinion.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_215.wav|59|It's so special.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_285.wav|51|It's part of the game, isn't it?
DUMMY2/p258/p258_108.wav|26|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_440.wav|7|His ambition was made this year when he played alongside his son.)
DUMMY2/p288/p288_034.wav|47|It was fit for royalty.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_327.wav|81|For the moment, our position remains the same.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_404.wav|60|They had three children.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_441.wav|65|Sir George said every company in the country has this issue at the moment.)
DUMMY2/p364/p364_205.wav|88|It is so beautiful.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_404.wav|98|But we say Yes - and we are the people.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_050.wav|102|Except for this, it was offside.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_026.wav|38|I want to win this thing.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_304.wav|105|Kids are terrible.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_397.wav|36|That investment has now been secured.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_446.wav|14|It wouldn't matter if he had.)
DUMMY2/p274/p274_431.wav|32|A police spokeswoman said last night that the case was closed.)
DUMMY2/p330/p330_040.wav|1|Thousands of homes were left without power supplies.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_408.wav|66|Women reported more depression than men.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_021.wav|0|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_163.wav|80|They should stop the bombing.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_105.wav|30|It separates the men from the boys.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_176.wav|59|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_308.wav|3|The concerns are the same.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_143.wav|61|Three penalties were given.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_346.wav|68|I can't blame the fans for getting frustrated.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_400.wav|36|Adventure is the champagne of life.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_435.wav|27|It is not either national standards or local control.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_240.wav|14|He does not much like the Liberal Democrats.)
DUMMY2/p236/p236_345.wav|75|Three years ago he would have been.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_386.wav|76|I can't wait for the outdoors.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_303.wav|5|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_045.wav|80|Is a drug dealer?
DUMMY2/p340/p340_198.wav|74|This is a disaster for us.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_433.wav|75|However, the downturn has forced the overdraft request.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_308.wav|80|And he goes with it.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_227.wav|32|We played them off the pitch.)
DUMMY2/p266/p266_084.wav|20|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_229.wav|45|It's that kind of place.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_369.wav|23|I don't know what we're doing wrong.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_030.wav|55|Schools do not create that.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_241.wav|8|The scientific debate is dead.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_100.wav|20|May not have been at fault?
DUMMY2/p267/p267_006.wav|0|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_423.wav|13|But honestly, there is no need for us to panic.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_272.wav|72|People were actually not on his side.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_130.wav|37|Potions said he would drive.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_066.wav|31|It came as a surprise because my job is to go backwards.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_220.wav|43|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_037.wav|55|Instead, we make the ground pay.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_152.wav|68|Who would take it now, after all this?
DUMMY2/p253/p253_258.wav|70|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_457.wav|14|It recommended that they reject the proposed legislation.)
DUMMY2/p283/p283_221.wav|95|They are still very quiet.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_293.wav|18|I'm not there yet but it is close.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_282.wav|72|As a schoolteacher he was an excellent coach.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_255.wav|3|The world is a good place.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_411.wav|49|He is very popular in the squad, in England, and abroad.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_404.wav|104|The pair are no strangers to smashing records.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_208.wav|73|That has been the easy part.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_151.wav|85|They will appear again next week.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_183.wav|55|I've no idea how it works.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_316.wav|9|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_410.wav|60|I intend to end it on a high.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_248.wav|63|They are the innocent victims.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_269.wav|33|There were moments of humour too.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_057.wav|13|One woman refused to sit down.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_098.wav|7|Figures are not relevant to the strategy.)
DUMMY2/p238/p238_361.wav|37|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_138.wav|30|Racism is alive and kicking in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_269.wav|105|She looked so young.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_173.wav|15|An inquiry has begun.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_238.wav|23|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_180.wav|19|We won't do that.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_075.wav|18|But there was no time for that.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_038.wav|95|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_296.wav|65|Perhaps they were right.)
DUMMY2/p273/p273_028.wav|56|It is about control of our economy.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_060.wav|96|That is very hard, alone.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_232.wav|50|She died in middle age.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_361.wav|21|These things have not happened by accident.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_132.wav|102|I've always been desperate to play this part.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_092.wav|62|I am very encouraged by this poll.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_295.wav|0|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_273.wav|32|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.)
DUMMY2/p278/p278_164.wav|10|You have to ask whether they have really thought through these issues.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_111.wav|90|Before the game we went for a pint.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_063.wav|72|No details were disclosed.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_386.wav|6|I loved it - and so did my friend.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_080.wav|50|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_133.wav|12|We haven't actually considered it down here.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_283.wav|30|Do yourselves a favour.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_088.wav|79|It's just a failing service.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_306.wav|29|It is an amazing response.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_029.wav|107|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_052.wav|43|It is the whole package.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_043.wav|81|We will push.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_259.wav|4|How can this be?
DUMMY2/p230/p230_063.wav|35|The tournament has now been cancelled.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_216.wav|55|The questions came quick and fast.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_007.wav|44|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_405.wav|105|No preference emerged.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_178.wav|65|We just want this session to end.)
DUMMY2/p363/p363_128.wav|6|We are getting not a penny.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_177.wav|14|That must be left to the Parole Board.)
DUMMY2/p362/p362_115.wav|15|Anyone can take a photo.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_030.wav|18|It was really good in the first week.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_289.wav|2|Who can predict?
DUMMY2/p233/p233_259.wav|84|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_397.wav|10|It has happened for generations.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_264.wav|87|The planning appears to have paid off.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_394.wav|26|This year I understood.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_269.wav|3|There is a world of difference.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_317.wav|45|Special measures were needed.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_249.wav|92|Here, the fans have been fantastic.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_322.wav|61|They wanted the club to make money.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_242.wav|21|Obviously, people are worried in the West Midlands.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_006.wav|23|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_356.wav|17|But he is frustrated at every turn.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_199.wav|8|Mr Blair was ready for him.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_097.wav|41|You will be.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_121.wav|83|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_094.wav|82|It was a funny feeling.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_199.wav|106|But he rejected calls for a public register of paedophiles.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_088.wav|68|At the time of watching, however, it is totally convincing.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_283.wav|105|Right up until a week ago we thought they were very keen.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_424.wav|7|The BBC was a disgrace.)
DUMMY2/p361/p361_015.wav|79|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_006.wav|8|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_072.wav|51|I think, overall, they were the best team in the tournament.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_318.wav|46|The Government has to grasp the nettle.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_296.wav|24|It has the potential to be another North Sea.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_349.wav|46|Tartan Day is not a Scottish event.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_330.wav|41|They haven't got a hope.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_246.wav|84|We did not compete with any other local farmer.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_153.wav|91|He was forced to quit.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_038.wav|10|Among them are many criminals.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_340.wav|12|Well, was it?
DUMMY2/p264/p264_369.wav|65|That is for white people.)
DUMMY2/p287/p287_391.wav|77|But we are very near.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_272.wav|81|She looked so young.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_240.wav|81|It was a kind of contempt.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_046.wav|103|We're talking about creating an attractive neighbourhood.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_254.wav|57|Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_162.wav|42|He admitted that he knew nothing about it.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_214.wav|75|The early physical reports were clear.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_010.wav|3|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_121.wav|23|This is excellent news for Glasgow.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_048.wav|85|And they removed a Borderer.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_352.wav|6|He was later deported.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_104.wav|15|They know their son was murdered.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_342.wav|39|Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_073.wav|74|This can be extreme.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_248.wav|24|I have spoken to the skipper.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_055.wav|80|It happens from time to time.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_014.wav|71|"To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. "
DUMMY2/p237/p237_304.wav|61|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_158.wav|19|Who was on the panel?
DUMMY2/p284/p284_032.wav|16|There's a story, too.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_263.wav|22|We are trying to clarify the issues.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_341.wav|20|But I was knocked out by the city.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_468.wav|75|The bill would be massive.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_255.wav|107|We are satisfied with this outcome.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_322.wav|86|It is a strong case.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_489.wav|48|Other casualties were averted by the swift response of the emergency services.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_258.wav|7|I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight.)
DUMMY2/p376/p376_070.wav|71|"We welcome the decision of Mr Byers."
DUMMY2/p301/p301_324.wav|91|A friendship that will endure.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_215.wav|63|It was a moment of madness.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_067.wav|15|I don't have a problem with it.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_199.wav|78|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_044.wav|74|That was a month ago.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_143.wav|58|My aim is a top six finish.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_188.wav|85|That would end it for us.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_300.wav|51|A statement is expected in April.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_162.wav|58|They will know they deserve to be there.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_311.wav|21|They need to be involved.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_233.wav|100|The statement contained no surprises.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_181.wav|25|Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_367.wav|27|All the investment is possible through the public sector.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_036.wav|77|This represents a tough game for us.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_354.wav|68|He saw it all as a big game.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_132.wav|49|My duty is to win.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_278.wav|67|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_230.wav|72|That could run into millions.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_368.wav|93|But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_320.wav|60|You've got to have both sides.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_083.wav|30|They won the trophy in the Hoops.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_130.wav|39|It would be great to reward the Scottish public with a win.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_036.wav|105|I was scared.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_185.wav|80|It is not either national standards or local control.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_028.wav|13|They are being deported from their homes.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_062.wav|76|They said they were only young men.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_065.wav|91|After this, the exercise was due to begin.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_245.wav|106|We were right to be afraid.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_377.wav|16|Clark is back on top form.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_164.wav|34|But it was to no avail.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_082.wav|18|I won't let that happen.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_285.wav|86|The death toll included five children.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_231.wav|62|Of course, we have to be very concerned about that.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_408.wav|103|It would show them a positive way forward.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_026.wav|99|It's a relief that a decision has finally been made.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_194.wav|84|It's a portrait of Glasgow, not the portrait.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_208.wav|36|They have the cash and the fire power.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_402.wav|7|They were to blame for the first two goals.)
DUMMY2/p363/p363_221.wav|6|We don't want that at all.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_181.wav|55|Parents do not know very much about drugs.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_177.wav|50|The Hibs manager is no fool.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_363.wav|86|Equity declined to comment.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_266.wav|100|The concerns are the same.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_031.wav|14|I feel so desperately sorry for Gordon and Sarah.)
DUMMY2/p298/p298_402.wav|68|You are going to Glasgow Airport, and not coming back.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_265.wav|17|I'm looking at ways to do that now.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_233.wav|90|It is set in Paris.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_342.wav|9|Is that an issue?
DUMMY2/p294/p294_131.wav|104|I can't see him reversing that.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_266.wav|5|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_326.wav|33|I played well but missed a few chances.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_156.wav|92|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
DUMMY2/p311/p311_276.wav|4|They also intend to travel today.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_411.wav|79|I found that we couldn't.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_031.wav|98|It is sending the wrong message to people.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_016.wav|20|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_191.wav|14|I put the drawing down.)
DUMMY2/p316/p316_110.wav|85|It has to find out what went wrong.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_274.wav|31|It looks as though he will be right.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_218.wav|57|That is an important part of our role.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_288.wav|103|Then followed a bout of flu.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_388.wav|63|That time may never be broken.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_175.wav|15|That is not, however, the case.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_257.wav|98|This is a personal decision for me.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_087.wav|52|I have no problems playing with such capable players in front of me.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_289.wav|102|The fund has three elements.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_060.wav|102|We welcome the decision of Mr Byers.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_263.wav|16|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_122.wav|23|If that is the perception, that has to be addressed.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_333.wav|3|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_117.wav|21|He also has property interests in the country.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_180.wav|39|You have to ask whether they have really thought through these issues.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_335.wav|62|The playing is perfectly turned out.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_093.wav|77|Before the game we went for a pint.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_207.wav|38|The frustration was showing.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_196.wav|18|It was a very strong metaphor.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_178.wav|23|This gives us a lot of practice.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_004.wav|40|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_359.wav|93|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_179.wav|39|So was the first half.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_071.wav|62|It happened again, and again, and again.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_308.wav|86|The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_174.wav|0|It is not a threat.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_250.wav|16|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_237.wav|32|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.)
DUMMY2/p251/p251_171.wav|9|I always felt they played for me.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_018.wav|27|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_468.wav|63|You have to have a proven track record to get them.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_215.wav|89|It's not before time.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_224.wav|55|He has many offers from the English Premiership.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_238.wav|6|I am very sorry to hear about this.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_061.wav|31|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_349.wav|41|It was very formal.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_064.wav|27|Scotland had great assets.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_189.wav|90|It is a terrible loss.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_212.wav|103|Three years probation is just a joke.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_149.wav|22|What the Department of Transport will make clear.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_237.wav|18|I think we're the better side.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_208.wav|85|My husband was fighting for his life.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_202.wav|2|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_289.wav|4|Fame and money followed.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_422.wav|20|It looked like a war zone.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_007.wav|8|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_276.wav|85|I just wanted to fly.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_352.wav|89|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_104.wav|70|That would be unlawful.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_100.wav|1|Creative, expressive football was the order of the day.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_367.wav|42|How is he enjoying life as a senior?
DUMMY2/p305/p305_365.wav|54|Eating was a nightmare, and it wasn't possible to sleep.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_062.wav|42|It obviously changes the prospects for getting agreement.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_340.wav|69|She said they would appeal.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_004.wav|28|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_178.wav|87|We are happy with the referee.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_040.wav|61|It's a great thing.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_331.wav|53|Having a Scot play against us would not achieve that.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_417.wav|64|The Government, however, insists the company is not for sale.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_185.wav|85|That, in a way, is the point.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_101.wav|77|New Year will be very busy.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_132.wav|103|Mr Blair was in Washington a week later.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_291.wav|100|He has run a hell of a race.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_134.wav|23|Fifteen minutes later, they were found.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_225.wav|86|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_326.wav|18|We are going to listen to Britain.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_301.wav|47|One was a lawyer.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_179.wav|1|I've done it almost like a variety show.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_045.wav|106|And they had a case.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_366.wav|100|He is not very big, either.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_401.wav|49|This is usually done by the space shuttle.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_072.wav|69|That was a gold medal for certain.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_429.wav|100|He was on a horse.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_159.wav|86|I've put my own money into this project.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_183.wav|70|They need to look after themselves.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_316.wav|47|I never thought it would take this long.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_379.wav|0|In fact, he was great today.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_285.wav|84|It was a privilege to work for him.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_163.wav|15|Genetic assessment is crucial.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_242.wav|58|I was the only one arguing differently.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_450.wav|50|We have just got to keep his feet on the ground.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_311.wav|85|It divided audiences at Cannes.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_350.wav|45|I got a yellow card.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_312.wav|99|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_279.wav|63|Do I think about them often ?
DUMMY2/p351/p351_377.wav|33|She makes me so happy.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_425.wav|105|It is bizarre.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_158.wav|96|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_011.wav|72|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_013.wav|44|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_019.wav|51|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_335.wav|106|The Government has completely lost control of GM crops.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_209.wav|42|It's a metaphor for consumption.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_271.wav|80|It's not even finished.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_257.wav|103|This is a wonderful honour for me.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_025.wav|76|They will be dealt with.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_145.wav|61|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_077.wav|46|One thing is certain.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_261.wav|102|If it wasn't so pathetic, it would be funny.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_373.wav|62|He said he needed no more evidence.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_164.wav|84|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_112.wav|84|I thought it was a fantastic game.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_088.wav|21|I will report in the spring.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_129.wav|24|I have learned from him.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_297.wav|92|John Prescott is John Prescott, as the prime minister would say.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_050.wav|51|We have no choice but to shut down.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_215.wav|60|I can understand that.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_281.wav|12|This is a great shame.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_189.wav|56|The company hopes to repeat the process in France.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_015.wav|87|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_280.wav|33|This is welcome news.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_235.wav|99|I haven't made the donation yet.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_225.wav|62|Sean Connery did not disappoint.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_073.wav|33|She was married with one son.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_287.wav|44|There is no smoking gun.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_209.wav|69|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_397.wav|24|There isn't the seriousness of other businesses.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_044.wav|80|It's a blessing.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_142.wav|3|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_129.wav|80|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_228.wav|75|From there, they can go anywhere.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_268.wav|96|Of course, that is not the whole story.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_260.wav|38|They would be wise to do just that.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_301.wav|37|how do you get it back ?
DUMMY2/p228/p228_268.wav|57|I was rubbish.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_029.wav|59|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_052.wav|89|They said she was stable.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_349.wav|93|He has to learn.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_033.wav|87|Further management changes are planned.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_277.wav|92|I've never regretted my decision.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_280.wav|28|There has been no cover-up - just the opposite in fact.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_208.wav|64|He is only now regaining his confidence.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_298.wav|67|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_329.wav|101|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_252.wav|8|It might be sad, but it's a fact.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_471.wav|48|There's nothing I can say.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_305.wav|59|We want to play at the worlds.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_134.wav|87|Brown also believes in Walker's innocence.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_093.wav|46|Whatever the final decision, one thing is certain.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_386.wav|77|It was like a vacuum.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_130.wav|67|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_238.wav|0|I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_066.wav|66|He is pretty upset.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_279.wav|45|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_324.wav|36|The Premier League has been a huge success.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_134.wav|70|We work well together.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_055.wav|36|The Government should be ashamed.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_245.wav|83|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_293.wav|42|But today was the real big one.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_015.wav|83|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_043.wav|43|Is there a new way forward?
DUMMY2/p341/p341_048.wav|66|All the lads are totally focused on that.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_167.wav|69|It is not like us.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_272.wav|4|They still have the dirty work to do.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_194.wav|63|Miller was every bit as happy.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_308.wav|59|This is the culture change in medicine.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_191.wav|89|We believe a third party was involved.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_254.wav|104|Their own instinctive response was confirmed.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_218.wav|80|But I am a worried man.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_352.wav|36|It intends to do so on Wednesday.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_328.wav|37|Margins are also in retreat.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_151.wav|26|Was this element always there?
DUMMY2/p228/p228_290.wav|57|Graeme was prepared.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_257.wav|13|He's been here on numerous occasions.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_381.wav|20|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_291.wav|34|He was just awesome.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_206.wav|62|Clearly the impact is going to be negative.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_205.wav|55|This should begin in October.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_216.wav|73|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_270.wav|52|Its primary business channel is the internet.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_125.wav|1|Who will perform?
DUMMY2/p239/p239_334.wav|48|Royal Bank declined to comment.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_330.wav|96|It could have gone either way.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_091.wav|53|I can't remember a lot about the accident.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_331.wav|35|This ruling is a farce.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_024.wav|10|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_168.wav|60|It was extremely difficult.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_034.wav|99|Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_199.wav|23|I am just looking to God.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_182.wav|68|They just would not have run away.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_233.wav|14|It will be strictly cross-country.)
DUMMY2/p317/p317_068.wav|97|It is an attitude of mind.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_460.wav|32|Let that be their memorial.)
DUMMY2/p228/p228_026.wav|57|So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_281.wav|50|They can leave at any time.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_041.wav|9|They may be wrong.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_189.wav|87|Millions of British jobs depend on Europe.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_095.wav|100|You are like an animal.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_115.wav|76|Such a policy would be a disaster.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_098.wav|70|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_186.wav|74|I want to be frank.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_250.wav|91|I hope it has helped the prisoners.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_033.wav|22|However, there are signs of dissent among his colleagues.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_162.wav|64|That's been our position all along.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_105.wav|45|He pleaded for caution.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_001.wav|17|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_345.wav|41|Tell us about it.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_184.wav|72|An announcement is expected today on their future.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_259.wav|63|This fact is supported by audience research.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_379.wav|68|I have beaten her a few times.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_292.wav|25|He wrote the letter two days before he died.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_005.wav|62|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_295.wav|89|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_402.wav|16|But we are a young side.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_357.wav|101|It is a sign of hope.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_385.wav|75|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_345.wav|50|Finally came the moment of truth.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_359.wav|28|So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_290.wav|15|Yet it seemed to work.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_229.wav|100|Life is too short to be bitter.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_410.wav|91|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_055.wav|56|Let's hope that it does.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_392.wav|75|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_449.wav|24|That will be best for him.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_112.wav|11|It was a sickening sight.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_080.wav|55|What do we do ?
DUMMY2/p286/p286_302.wav|63|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_304.wav|46|It will be about commitment, not compliance.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_053.wav|56|What do we do ?
DUMMY2/p264/p264_281.wav|65|He will get his chances.)
DUMMY2/p278/p278_277.wav|10|He was released after treatment.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_282.wav|103|He was at home with his pals.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_053.wav|7|We have not given up hope.)
DUMMY2/p255/p255_126.wav|31|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_057.wav|51|It is not normal practice.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_086.wav|105|It's never too late.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_163.wav|5|We have a budget in March.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_289.wav|16|No Briton has ever won.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_455.wav|32|It was like someone had died.)
DUMMY2/p286/p286_405.wav|63|Clark is back on top form.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_112.wav|28|The boys are very confident.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_226.wav|92|It left me with a sadness.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_207.wav|6|We have still got the fight in us.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_081.wav|94|This is the way things should be handled.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_098.wav|17|I don't know how it happened.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_365.wav|46|It was a bit like having children.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_026.wav|67|He said the matter had been neglected in the past.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_477.wav|7|The price paid for it was not disclosed.)
DUMMY2/p236/p236_417.wav|75|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_227.wav|8|Basically, they have to come up with the offer.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_060.wav|80|That's the truth.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_298.wav|66|It's the curse of our time, irony.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_277.wav|23|It has, however, been a long time coming.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_213.wav|73|It's not before time.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_164.wav|65|The options seem limited.)
DUMMY2/p254/p254_110.wav|41|He takes the job.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_314.wav|78|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_196.wav|1|Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_324.wav|48|It particularly increases under-age drinking, he claimed.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_021.wav|28|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_099.wav|37|Then followed a bout of flu.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_055.wav|28|They may yet have the last laugh.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_237.wav|10|The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_150.wav|34|Here he is, in effect, appointing himself a judge.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_300.wav|72|After New Labour, we now have New Unionists.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_034.wav|102|Blood samples have been taken.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_299.wav|38|Her grand-daughter was uninjured.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_081.wav|30|A spokesman for Lothian and Borders Police said.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_385.wav|56|Theatre is not a museum.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_140.wav|95|If not, a deal could take many months.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_344.wav|82|We live in shorthand.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_422.wav|104|It was really enjoyable on Saturday.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_055.wav|64|No, it wasn't supposed to do that, officials admitted.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_372.wav|8|The selection will be made by the International Olympic Committee next year.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_278.wav|63|What was the matter for concern ?
DUMMY2/p300/p300_150.wav|102|Again and again, at every level, he delivered the goods.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_040.wav|36|They want to be entertained.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_258.wav|14|Labour was too busy to respond.)
DUMMY2/p231/p231_128.wav|50|That is far too high.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_332.wav|7|What are they for ?)
DUMMY2/p376/p376_285.wav|71|"It is a vote of confidence in the skills in Scotland."
DUMMY2/p263/p263_131.wav|39|You can spend money on housing.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_166.wav|17|His arguments were supported by Mr Bevan.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_023.wav|101|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_087.wav|78|It would have been around the turn of the century.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_185.wav|67|One season, they might do well.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_380.wav|75|People are on the alert.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_201.wav|91|Well, what do you know?
DUMMY2/p274/p274_335.wav|32|He has left the company.)
DUMMY2/p340/p340_083.wav|74|Everyone in front of me was dead.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_363.wav|95|They were impressive against France.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_354.wav|13|The board of governors must act.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_037.wav|67|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_115.wav|24|It's good to have a voice.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_190.wav|0|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_280.wav|63|Is it in the right place ?
DUMMY2/p333/p333_292.wav|64|My wife is totally behind me on this.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_324.wav|46|This is my music.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_237.wav|100|I need a publishing deal!
DUMMY2/p299/p299_334.wav|58|I am not retiring.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_324.wav|19|The referee had a shocking game.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_276.wav|7|Defensive stocks attracted some interest.)
DUMMY2/p261/p261_246.wav|100|The irony was not lost.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_372.wav|89|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_330.wav|86|Who was the mystery MP?
DUMMY2/p295/p295_389.wav|92|The team is in division one in Spain.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_330.wav|27|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_383.wav|89|Yet the data is compelling.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_165.wav|13|Are you all right at the front?
DUMMY2/p330/p330_057.wav|1|And thought we would get away with it.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_437.wav|27|We are all equal.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_405.wav|1|We didn't know if people would turn up.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_393.wav|64|He now describes himself as Scottish Labour.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_063.wav|71|"Art is extra."
DUMMY2/p263/p263_186.wav|39|Time is now very short.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_252.wav|72|This is a defining moment in this parliament.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_111.wav|85|Until you hit the big games.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_303.wav|107|My friends were very envious.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_097.wav|14|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.)
DUMMY2/p260/p260_275.wav|81|If not, he should go home.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_090.wav|17|This is the best moment of my career.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_179.wav|22|There was a fossil on screen.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_275.wav|12|She is a very lucky young lady.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_006.wav|6|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_168.wav|54|In my opinion it was a mistake, and never on purpose.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_142.wav|56|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
DUMMY2/p335/p335_183.wav|49|Whether this return was too soon.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_232.wav|57|We just had a go.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_310.wav|105|They had a confession.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_316.wav|22|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_379.wav|105|He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_128.wav|76|What has changed since then?
DUMMY2/p267/p267_260.wav|0|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_046.wav|51|That view has not altered.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_268.wav|44|It is a difficult thing to explain.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_265.wav|5|There is no link.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_218.wav|68|We didn't know if people would turn up.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_164.wav|75|The striker needed attention before he could resume.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_415.wav|40|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_394.wav|27|But we are a young side.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_270.wav|82|There is enormous interest in Scotland the Brand.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_044.wav|71|"We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there."
DUMMY2/p267/p267_002.wav|0|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_013.wav|26|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_202.wav|10|I came home by ambulance.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_297.wav|40|One was a lawyer.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_378.wav|105|They are good.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_186.wav|8|They are determined to make a meaningful contribution.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_260.wav|4|We are still alive and kicking.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_188.wav|34|Rather than just a way in, she begins with an entrance.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_188.wav|107|I'm really proud of my young players.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_134.wav|4|I could do a better job.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_072.wav|26|This is the way things should be handled.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_077.wav|12|You'd think there was a match on today.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_373.wav|38|Liberal Democrat leader makes the hash of it.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_214.wav|3|This is an interesting link.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_009.wav|34|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_322.wav|50|We want to play at the worlds.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_231.wav|24|His third goal was superb.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_369.wav|56|The statement finally came on Wednesday night after the market had closed.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_012.wav|35|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_337.wav|62|But he did not rule out further talks.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_114.wav|97|The working families tax credit is far better.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_176.wav|66|This is a very positive step forward.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_285.wav|0|That goes back a long way.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_353.wav|103|He denied that he was an absentee landlord.

DUMMY2/p251/p251_011.wav|9|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_408.wav|105|She has reached the top of her profession.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_230.wav|88|There is nothing wrong with that.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_309.wav|19|I find this ongoing debate is demeaning.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_366.wav|11|It was a game they could have won.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_181.wav|71|"Mr Marshall is expected to join the council of Europe."
DUMMY2/p264/p264_456.wav|65|It had been accepted.)
DUMMY2/p360/p360_233.wav|60|This is wonderful news.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_368.wav|48|Corporate banking would be based in Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_106.wav|34|We are not dealing here with refugees.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_083.wav|54|However, it is much bigger than that.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_421.wav|38|I think it is totally wrong.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_148.wav|80|The idea is simple.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_031.wav|59|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_075.wav|60|It's worth it, though.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_022.wav|6|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_023.wav|66|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_117.wav|62|Such is the scene of the tragedy.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_213.wav|59|It was good fun.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_364.wav|85|Fishermen are still in a state of confusion.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_304.wav|74|We are not there yet.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_378.wav|89|That's the name of the game, though.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_307.wav|96|The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_203.wav|47|Now, it's all right.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_217.wav|32|That wasn't an outstanding performance from Celtic.)
DUMMY2/p297/p297_045.wav|42|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_231.wav|97|But, in the end, he did - and blew him away.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_319.wav|13|He had no answer.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_082.wav|36|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_191.wav|11|The number never came.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_352.wav|106|I grew up with that in the amateur game.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_234.wav|103|I can't wait for the outdoors.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_219.wav|12|I might get an injury very easily.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_403.wav|14|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.)
DUMMY2/p254/p254_034.wav|41|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_290.wav|9|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_221.wav|76|It sounds like an appalling, tragic incident.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_067.wav|39|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_228.wav|60|It will be a huge difference.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_286.wav|43|Yet, it worked.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_009.wav|15|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_447.wav|65|In the old days, it was easy.)
DUMMY2/p234/p234_065.wav|3|Indeed, it is only the beginning.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_112.wav|39|That all hope is never lost.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_350.wav|54|We have got a full house tonight.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_363.wav|37|A small number of new jobs will also be created.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_110.wav|45|They were behind the wheel.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_291.wav|71|"I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission."
DUMMY2/p302/p302_054.wav|30|It is a serious offence of reckless conduct.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_229.wav|3|We are waiting for the Minister to come back with an answer.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_092.wav|66|Israel has done very little until now.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_285.wav|24|was everything done to save people ?
DUMMY2/p364/p364_207.wav|88|In many ways it was disastrous.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_221.wav|36|how do you get it back ?
DUMMY2/p231/p231_064.wav|50|It was a lovely experience.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_309.wav|94|However, the snow was welcomed by some.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_036.wav|82|We're in a state of shock and disbelief.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_079.wav|26|New Zealand rugby is totally different.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_278.wav|54|Yet he chose to do something different.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_170.wav|47|It's quite a routine.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_352.wav|50|So what happens next ?
DUMMY2/p270/p270_081.wav|8|They lived for their children.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_389.wav|98|I am not going to sit back.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_347.wav|61|Indeed, it was magical.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_123.wav|7|We had another last Tuesday.)
DUMMY2/p254/p254_149.wav|41|This is the way things should be handled.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_125.wav|45|The goals were good.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_211.wav|41|It's not ideal.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_352.wav|83|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_069.wav|42|This is a very high price.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_144.wav|85|I am not retiring.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_106.wav|56|New Year will be very busy.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_096.wav|37|He was at home with his pals.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_268.wav|10|It is not enough to be first division champions.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_357.wav|7|The advisers had some discussions but no conclusion was reached.)
DUMMY2/p262/p262_086.wav|45|Today I couldn't run on it.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_060.wav|53|It was a day she thought she would never see.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_120.wav|10|You can spend money on housing.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_103.wav|43|They were outside the circle.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_047.wav|65|The results, out tomorrow, will focus on the company's strategy.)
DUMMY2/p323/p323_007.wav|34|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_131.wav|18|It succeeds in a direct and convincing manner.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_049.wav|83|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_308.wav|74|She died a few days later.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_199.wav|18|The Parliament will make its own decisions.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_006.wav|92|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_313.wav|77|They are not left wing.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_115.wav|100|It isn't a happy memory.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_143.wav|73|We are now up against it.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_255.wav|42|Mr Straw was home secretary at the time.

DUMMY2/p233/p233_315.wav|84|The problems began a long time ago.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_279.wav|27|They seem to get away with it.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_381.wav|4|The replacements made a big difference.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_097.wav|57|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.

DUMMY2/p230/p230_128.wav|35|He was a home referee.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_290.wav|36|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_053.wav|13|Fewer people are being killed in accidents.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_207.wav|70|The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_104.wav|31|Further protests are likely.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_080.wav|71|"Nothing is yet confirmed."
DUMMY2/p336/p336_020.wav|98|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.

DUMMY2/p312/p312_208.wav|62|She looked very settled.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_080.wav|48|They hoped to remain in the Edinburgh area.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_035.wav|96|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_281.wav|14|They are interior designers and architects.)
DUMMY2/p244/p244_171.wav|78|It is not about the money, it is about everything.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_224.wav|104|It should be a pretty exciting session.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_276.wav|50|These figures are truly terrible.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_129.wav|10|This should begin in October.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_064.wav|86|The script was funny.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_259.wav|69|It's very nice.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_195.wav|90|Mr Kennedy is not a candidate for the Scottish Parliament.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_078.wav|90|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_422.wav|60|They need time to think.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_367.wav|78|Lately, that market has come under pressure.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_408.wav|92|Barry will be able to handle this.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_024.wav|77|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_067.wav|105|It's all I can do.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_217.wav|29|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_325.wav|45|My body is clearly capable.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_382.wav|26|It was a cry for help.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_194.wav|7|I cannot say too much about them.)
DUMMY2/p362/p362_193.wav|15|This is a business.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_016.wav|103|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_074.wav|38|It was very personal and very intimate.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_200.wav|71|"The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring."
DUMMY2/p276/p276_131.wav|106|Diversions were put in place.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_023.wav|45|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_269.wav|31|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_013.wav|65|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. )
DUMMY2/p261/p261_424.wav|100|This market has been neglected by the whisky industry.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_322.wav|91|It's a record label, not a form of music.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_296.wav|63|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_096.wav|41|All options are open.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_256.wav|40|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_128.wav|7|They made such decisions in London.)
DUMMY2/p341/p341_294.wav|66|You've got it coming Kabul.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_397.wav|13|I am immensely sad.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_257.wav|17|No, is the answer to your first question.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_356.wav|65|We accept the new rules.)
DUMMY2/p297/p297_395.wav|42|It was to be published next month.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_035.wav|72|But there was a heavy price to pay.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_012.wav|97|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_126.wav|66|The next few months will tell.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_176.wav|12|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_273.wav|35|That should be the subject matter of a public debate.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_187.wav|40|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_330.wav|39|We have a good healthy debate.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_036.wav|85|He was in his element.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_072.wav|18|Today is the first step in that process.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_193.wav|94|It had been in place since last July.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_355.wav|32|Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.)
DUMMY2/p269/p269_122.wav|94|She has been shot.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_049.wav|23|This is thought to mean sometime next week.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_196.wav|26|Is that success?
DUMMY2/p282/p282_227.wav|83|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_270.wav|12|The main thing is that they enjoy it.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_307.wav|31|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_118.wav|98|But no, it's not funny.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_076.wav|98|He has not created a Festival resource.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_180.wav|18|A film is different from a book.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_003.wav|44|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_290.wav|30|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_337.wav|37|Abbey National is an option.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_177.wav|42|I couldn't honestly tell you.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_019.wav|47|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_431.wav|37|We go there with confidence.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_353.wav|83|And he laughs.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_065.wav|29|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_374.wav|24|It's fantastic to win again.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_275.wav|92|My view has now completely changed.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_038.wav|70|It was clear.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_065.wav|74|This has been a long process.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_300.wav|34|And she doesn't feel like Annika is better.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_191.wav|44|The rear of the plane was on fire.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_121.wav|40|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_033.wav|106|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_040.wav|13|I wish the solutions were as easy.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_388.wav|7|It was a massive error of judgment.)
DUMMY2/p240/p240_034.wav|93|People love to see this stuff.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_010.wav|33|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_294.wav|107|Is something which we just don't do.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_217.wav|45|But the military campaign is a military campaign against Osama bin Laden.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_032.wav|17|I can't believe something like this could happen.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_281.wav|96|It's a way of life.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_349.wav|66|I've already got them in.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_202.wav|58|He explained to his audience.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_264.wav|90|I have never been a close friend of Jim McLean.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_224.wav|97|I could go on, but none of these things is true.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_128.wav|15|I had never done anything like it before.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_359.wav|97|They thought the set-up there was unfair.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_181.wav|50|I am not ready to walk away.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_223.wav|10|Today we must not repeat that mistake.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_262.wav|66|When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_136.wav|106|Dancing will help his ankles and his feet.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_373.wav|56|There is no deal as yet.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_158.wav|9|Neither side can win this war.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_334.wav|11|We just want them home.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_053.wav|43|He had no enemies.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_398.wav|89|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_206.wav|24|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_284.wav|15|I'm just feeling very tired - but it's great.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_376.wav|69|You can cope with it.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_254.wav|62|Perhaps it was her demeanour.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_119.wav|87|They would be supported by visiting specialists.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_432.wav|8|In fact, the reasons are simple.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_368.wav|18|He is doing just that.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_285.wav|37|But I was glad to see these interviews.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_341.wav|6|I don't know, really.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_046.wav|80|As she explains.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_203.wav|71|"I don't want to use it."
DUMMY2/p236/p236_002.wav|75|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_105.wav|14|Gordon Marshall was outstanding against us.)
DUMMY2/p243/p243_199.wav|53|There was no way back for Rangers after that blow.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_372.wav|19|This was not a summit about the euro.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_020.wav|8|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_365.wav|22|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_310.wav|30|Entries for the event are still being accepted.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_025.wav|80|She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_290.wav|23|There was still more disquiet in Israel.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_363.wav|41|There was no option.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_424.wav|50|The road was closed for several hours.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_052.wav|22|She is now planning a visit.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_037.wav|40|They're just different.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_086.wav|53|Clearly he knows nothing about Glasgow or Glasgow Green.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_216.wav|64|It separates the men from the boys.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_249.wav|5|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_143.wav|89|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_420.wav|19|Who can tell?
DUMMY2/p340/p340_228.wav|74|I don't like to fail.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_232.wav|18|I think the Scottish bid is very strong.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_262.wav|63|Kingfisher can afford to wait.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_364.wav|93|The council said the house would have to be demolished.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_014.wav|2|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_244.wav|60|The observer saw no evidence of fighting.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_286.wav|83|She is really magic.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_123.wav|64|Martin Johnson, the England captain, was back, and commanding.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_316.wav|57|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_342.wav|26|I've got no secret.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_176.wav|73|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_128.wav|96|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_399.wav|49|It is a comforting fantasy - but it remains a fantasy.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_167.wav|27|As, indeed, they would be.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_339.wav|39|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_236.wav|30|This is a club on the rise.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_022.wav|85|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_257.wav|85|I have totally had enough.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_292.wav|28|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_069.wav|76|We have no idea what caused the derailment.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_198.wav|36|It decided to blame the media.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_302.wav|0|I am a retailer by nature.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_110.wav|94|I can't even get into the A team.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_423.wav|104|Athletics is on a roll in the country.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_257.wav|81|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_204.wav|13|She made no further comment.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_415.wav|14|Stevenson was arrested on Monday morning.)
DUMMY2/p229/p229_285.wav|67|If not, he should go home.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_204.wav|98|I'm trying to be relaxed about the future.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_138.wav|53|We must pay teachers to take rugby in schools.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_189.wav|22|The role was perfect for Russell.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_269.wav|45|He was also married with two children.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_060.wav|57|He will now seek to sell his shares in the club.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_238.wav|24|I wouldn't even respond to that question.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_088.wav|14|Those people must be accountable.)
DUMMY2/p285/p285_042.wav|2|Sure, it's funny.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_369.wav|10|I was delighted to accept.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_201.wav|52|One in eight workers in Edinburgh works for Standard Life alone.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_187.wav|95|We have a budget in March.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_056.wav|98|I have been there many times.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_130.wav|44|Above all the aggression must be stopped.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_353.wav|37|This measure is not adjusted for seasonal factors.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_431.wav|65|We cannot ask for them back.)
DUMMY2/p313/p313_193.wav|76|All these things have an impact.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_276.wav|94|But, in fact, the reverse is true.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_205.wav|31|He has a lot of experience as captain in his career.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_484.wav|75|That is the bottom line.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_071.wav|101|He is in the queue.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_012.wav|25|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_109.wav|52|Scotland is never far away at Westminster.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_013.wav|92|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_124.wav|30|There is only one caveat.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_035.wav|107|How come it is so often unnoticed?
DUMMY2/p303/p303_138.wav|44|It could have been a hammering by now.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_165.wav|81|Again, we were lucky.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_143.wav|8|Before it was an ordeal.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_290.wav|106|We have a budget in March.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_414.wav|50|They are looking for profit.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_036.wav|92|She asked me for the appointment with me.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_104.wav|23|And, also, when he does not have the ball.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_310.wav|5|The letters are going out today.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_204.wav|15|I'm looking forward to coming home.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_190.wav|41|Off I went.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_002.wav|65|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  )
DUMMY2/p313/p313_342.wav|76|When it comes down to it, this is a job.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_384.wav|105|I never won a penny throughout my career.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_051.wav|93|It's a blessing.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_282.wav|60|It was important to bring them all together.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_275.wav|11|I don't know why you say goodbye.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_083.wav|52|That kind of growth is the important thing.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_230.wav|62|He was replaced by John Spencer.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_201.wav|44|It was a very difficult decision for us.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_313.wav|82|They were not missing much.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_212.wav|77|It had all been arranged.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_169.wav|58|Freedom from Serbia is a growing objective.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_308.wav|69|My body is clearly capable.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_123.wav|104|He seems to be used to the attention.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_461.wav|100|It might be useful to have something in black and white.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_072.wav|45|I had my suspicions.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_073.wav|103|He would be with his peers.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_093.wav|19|There's also the point.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_491.wav|75|Our fans have been marvellous.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_017.wav|16|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_076.wav|60|That perhaps is behind the problem.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_287.wav|92|But the championship is not over yet.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_182.wav|44|They just would not have run away.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_012.wav|94|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_213.wav|86|His third goal was superb.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_459.wav|63|The damage has been done.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_355.wav|55|What form did that take ?
DUMMY2/p323/p323_307.wav|34|The plot is changing as time goes on.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_181.wav|67|Does that put pressure on us ?
DUMMY2/p279/p279_053.wav|25|It's a blessing.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_178.wav|14|Overall, the labour market continued to tighten.)
DUMMY2/p248/p248_153.wav|99|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_390.wav|29|Celtic were pleased to help.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_037.wav|103|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_213.wav|85|I got very, very tired.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_352.wav|26|A report is the first step in a criminal case in India.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_252.wav|106|No-one from the Fire Brigades Union was available for comment yesterday.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_352.wav|33|This latter suggestion is very important.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_232.wav|46|Nobody can change it overnight, but you can make a start.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_310.wav|10|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_385.wav|96|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_379.wav|64|This must be kept in total perspective.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_324.wav|34|She is an expert on medical ethics.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_257.wav|27|The concerns are the same.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_200.wav|27|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_045.wav|78|They are going after them.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_342.wav|93|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_154.wav|88|Everyone would have been happy.
