DUMMY2/p253/p253_354.wav|70|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_196.wav|103|Nor should there have been.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_267.wav|48|The latter can only account for a small proportion of calls.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_261.wav|3|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_162.wav|52|That will reduce my chance of selection.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_336.wav|106|MOVIE stars are public property.

DUMMY2/p318/p318_274.wav|19|My mother is a widow.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_265.wav|51|I played well on Saturday and again today.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_235.wav|48|Of course, it is a tough assignment.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_282.wav|86|Yet, it worked.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_216.wav|80|We will give a formal response to the report in due course.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_361.wav|66|That's an old idea.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_307.wav|81|Work has started.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_419.wav|92|Everything is surrounded by confusion.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_433.wav|63|There is another important factor.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_372.wav|65|I took my chance.)
DUMMY2/p236/p236_196.wav|75|They need to look after themselves.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_013.wav|1|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_208.wav|17|This will be just another tax on motorists.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_014.wav|70|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_392.wav|66|There was someone on the floor.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_104.wav|21|And we have beaten them before.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_083.wav|107|They won the trophy in the Hoops.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_183.wav|14|One season, they might do well.)
DUMMY2/p281/p281_190.wav|36|He prefers to play for them.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_207.wav|3|What do we want to do that for ?
DUMMY2/p308/p308_395.wav|107|I'd never seen a play about me.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_127.wav|45|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_411.wav|42|You have to rely on each other.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_179.wav|97|I was delighted with Robbie.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_055.wav|67|It has been a horrible, horrible time.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_292.wav|80|He should have won.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_392.wav|106|They would have to go to the Royal.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_174.wav|68|I think we showed that after half time.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_286.wav|96|It was a privilege to work for him.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_196.wav|13|John Lennon is a very large industry.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_097.wav|99|I had a ball today.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_247.wav|88|Stand by for action.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_098.wav|77|We have got a race.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_068.wav|95|The motive for the shooting was not known.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_023.wav|97|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_421.wav|104|The auction will be held tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_242.wav|56|You can feel at home in China.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_233.wav|9|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_262.wav|100|There will be widespread support on all sides.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_195.wav|51|Our customers come first.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_068.wav|100|It starts with the script.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_375.wav|66|Folk music is in her blood.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_297.wav|8|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_287.wav|70|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_192.wav|85|Retirement is on his mind.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_158.wav|35|You had to go and see him.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_194.wav|24|Miller was every bit as happy.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_281.wav|0|He was also married with two children.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_109.wav|10|The music industry hasn't changed at all.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_077.wav|29|I first met him last summer.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_314.wav|16|The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_327.wav|2|The party is up for it.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_206.wav|97|On this form, they have a real chance of going up.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_315.wav|38|The hotel was now for sale.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_062.wav|77|It has been an amazing day.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_294.wav|25|These figures are truly awful.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_253.wav|52|Rangers then had a couple of good efforts.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_411.wav|14|Does it matter ?)
DUMMY2/p293/p293_086.wav|23|Self control is just one instalment.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_016.wav|104|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_403.wav|34|We didn't make any of this up.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_344.wav|16|Two people were interviewed.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_216.wav|35|He has made his base in Spain.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_293.wav|46|Sub Not Used, McCulloch.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_109.wav|88|Success in Scotland is important.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_105.wav|27|It is a love affair.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_103.wav|53|We were under a bit of pressure.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_368.wav|32|But the Foreign Secretary can cope.)
DUMMY2/p318/p318_073.wav|19|It really has left the town in shock.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_058.wav|86|I was an athlete.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_291.wav|42|That's a trend which will be encouraged.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_126.wav|96|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_160.wav|20|There's a pause.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_360.wav|17|Clearly, it is time to meet this young man.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_206.wav|103|We will not break even.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_146.wav|3|In addition, investor choice is reduced.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_225.wav|57|Women were mostly notable by their absence.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_118.wav|101|We suffered a lot for seven years.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_183.wav|42|I read it every year.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_195.wav|71|"The group is separate from the Real IRA."
DUMMY2/p314/p314_235.wav|51|Come to that, is any of this really happening?
DUMMY2/p277/p277_284.wav|89|Bombing slaughter rejected
DUMMY2/p260/p260_223.wav|81|My wife and family are the support system.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_287.wav|17|He has been campaigning for change for years.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_276.wav|97|Last year's winner was Sergio Garcia.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_212.wav|84|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_099.wav|6|This is a great shame.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_090.wav|31|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_330.wav|81|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_145.wav|49|It's too big a risk to take.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_181.wav|57|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_004.wav|69|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_239.wav|35|No evidence that it was Osama bin Laden.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_171.wav|1|There were unconfirmed reports that it was cannabis.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_079.wav|47|Every woman deserves to live without this type of fear.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_250.wav|44|But first it goes out on TV.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_034.wav|62|Well, you might have a point.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_083.wav|46|The Hague is too good for him.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_011.wav|31|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_153.wav|104|Feel the air, the space.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_338.wav|8|Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_232.wav|36|I am considered a teenager.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_033.wav|19|This is a disaster averted for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_035.wav|39|I could not do it.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_066.wav|19|He got his degree.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_108.wav|18|I don't know what we're doing wrong.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_140.wav|78|Are you from the rugby ?
DUMMY2/p329/p329_103.wav|103|We make good weapons.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_256.wav|23|The protest will go ahead as planned.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_015.wav|18|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_184.wav|46|The firm was down and almost out.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_362.wav|8|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_102.wav|32|I did not think about the Ryder Cup.)
DUMMY2/p299/p299_148.wav|58|These matters are now behind us.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_084.wav|37|He's very young and very keen to do well.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_085.wav|62|That never seemed likely.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_070.wav|103|It was not the greatest performance, but it was effective.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_377.wav|65|It would have to look for outside funding.)
DUMMY2/p329/p329_001.wav|103|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_054.wav|59|They had to explain it.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_122.wav|72|We are taking the back seat on this.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_419.wav|8|Surrey police said no body had been found.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_407.wav|89|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_390.wav|97|They think that it matters but it doesn't.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_302.wav|29|Her appeal is to be heard this week.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_333.wav|12|There has been no cover-up - just the opposite in fact.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_277.wav|90|They were on holiday in Egypt.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_133.wav|21|The referee had a shocking game.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_173.wav|36|To get good people, you need to offer them enough money.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_323.wav|34|And a mightily impressive recording it is, too.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_159.wav|26|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_007.wav|28|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_131.wav|56|There's always the next century.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_261.wav|39|You look like a rugby player.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_220.wav|80|Feel the heat?
DUMMY2/p268/p268_253.wav|87|The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_251.wav|39|Do I think about them often ?
DUMMY2/p307/p307_128.wav|22|He was just awesome.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_361.wav|82|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_293.wav|97|Obviously, Airbus is one of these.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_076.wav|26|I first met him last summer.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_330.wav|1|There is a solution, she believes.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_265.wav|42|I made a big mistake.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_194.wav|40|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_005.wav|66|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_041.wav|36|A week is a long time in politics.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_089.wav|37|This is equally relevant to the landowner.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_341.wav|35|Clearly, the need for a personal loan is written in the stars.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_182.wav|1|The actor has met with Mandela.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_123.wav|85|It is all up to the Members.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_097.wav|5|They make a selective perception process.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_292.wav|98|I just made it.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_294.wav|46|Six months later, they returned to Scotland.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_081.wav|17|But it took a lot of bottle.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_062.wav|64|The chief constable is right.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_322.wav|25|He got the same story.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_171.wav|58|Was it a foul?
DUMMY2/p339/p339_104.wav|18|It was a disaster.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_317.wav|72|Everyone is taking a breath and waiting.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_344.wav|42|O, Is there anything in the wound?
DUMMY2/p343/p343_317.wav|21|I will work on her.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_044.wav|55|Something old something new, as it were.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_240.wav|41|My future is in the marathon.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_380.wav|82|I also thought, This is a feature film.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_269.wav|40|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_246.wav|7|Things were so intense in the studio.)
DUMMY2/p312/p312_067.wav|62|I think it's more important to have fun.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_088.wav|16|It is a lifeline.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_215.wav|66|All inquiries should be made to the police.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_009.wav|61|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_398.wav|74|Detectives are still working on the case.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_158.wav|92|There has been a fair bit in between, too.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_232.wav|23|Three others were wounded.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_021.wav|2|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_066.wav|33|We have got the school holidays on.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_341.wav|67|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_273.wav|23|It is typical of me.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_402.wav|69|Emotions were complex.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_244.wav|26|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_028.wav|68|That is just a load of baloney.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_381.wav|0|He has been in a nursing home for two years.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_202.wav|73|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_124.wav|106|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_185.wav|15|She has the biggest part.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_238.wav|7|It was finally agreed on Saturday.)
DUMMY2/p278/p278_159.wav|10|Worry can have that effect on some citizens.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_279.wav|14|It was a minor incident.)
DUMMY2/p250/p250_032.wav|24|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_267.wav|45|Immediate action must be taken.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_237.wav|1|After that date, the numbers should stabilise or fall.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_075.wav|93|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_029.wav|38|It used to bother me sometimes, but it doesn't any more.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_420.wav|14|That is not the position of the British relatives.)
DUMMY2/p265/p265_003.wav|73|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_368.wav|49|Its people are inventive, talented and diligent.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_181.wav|88|It's part of your life.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_154.wav|48|Hopefully, no-one will suffer too badly.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_171.wav|61|I was in the train station overnight.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_309.wav|56|I was brought up in a mining background.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_237.wav|81|You can feel at home in China.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_220.wav|70|Clearly, the stakes are high.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_248.wav|40|The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_151.wav|46|I just wasn't very good.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_155.wav|85|Things begin to spring to life.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_043.wav|12|It has been a horrible, horrible time.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_343.wav|82|No one would believe him.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_040.wav|58|We agreed to disagree.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_084.wav|76|That's why the ministers resigned.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_381.wav|19|It is, however, an unlikely outcome.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_294.wav|32|Strikers like to go to the ground.)
DUMMY2/p374/p374_123.wav|11|Pitt, of course, would play the lead singer.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_054.wav|6|That is why this action has been taken.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_025.wav|70|But it failed.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_099.wav|46|Could they perhaps be related?
DUMMY2/p310/p310_296.wav|17|That was the most annoying thing.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_116.wav|47|That's all right then.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_220.wav|66|I just could not cope.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_122.wav|93|There were no grounds for his action.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_386.wav|102|Construction would then begin.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_020.wav|42|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_312.wav|1|It was a cry for help.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_112.wav|89|Two of the team became ill.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_375.wav|97|After that, it's a step into the unknown.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_238.wav|83|It is hard won.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_329.wav|94|The election is total confusion and chaos.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_119.wav|61|Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_337.wav|18|Sprinters are not fit.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_027.wav|65|He does not even trust his own members.)
DUMMY2/p374/p374_045.wav|11|As a player you have to move on.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_315.wav|85|The film was great.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_067.wav|47|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_294.wav|55|White would like to buy further bus businesses.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_281.wav|78|Obviously, we would want to look at this.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_400.wav|95|Final proposals will be published in February.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_402.wav|15|This is a very serious matter.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_083.wav|4|I've done nothing wrong, and that's the truth.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_017.wav|50|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_216.wav|26|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_196.wav|45|The service from the other players was super.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_148.wav|28|It's a difficult one to comment on.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_235.wav|86|We were extremely poor.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_362.wav|18|I cannot really commit.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_053.wav|46|No, it wasn't supposed to do that, officials admitted.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_295.wav|31|Who can predict?
DUMMY2/p308/p308_154.wav|107|I know you went back this morning.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_006.wav|18|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_219.wav|9|We have got to get it right.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_166.wav|65|Royal Bank provided debt funding for the deals.)
DUMMY2/p326/p326_051.wav|28|I found a fault and worked at it.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_081.wav|86|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_009.wav|60|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_049.wav|20|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_423.wav|42|There was a substantial explosion.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_356.wav|98|Not so, it transpires.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_360.wav|82|It is not simple.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_102.wav|44|Next league matches, Dundee United - Kilmarnock.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_128.wav|38|This could be a recipe for conflict.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_042.wav|4|There can be no two ways about it.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_128.wav|34|He probably would not have added, mainly by me.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_239.wav|86|A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_223.wav|57|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_321.wav|76|But everyone is entitled to their own opinion.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_037.wav|9|At this stage, we think the air campaign is enough.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_233.wav|74|So it should be.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_053.wav|33|There is no signature on this document.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_124.wav|37|So what happens next ?
DUMMY2/p299/p299_153.wav|58|Most of the public are behind me.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_219.wav|33|This is a historic agreement.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_349.wav|38|People acted too quickly.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_042.wav|53|He does not even trust his own members.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_381.wav|102|Who is going to pay their wages?
DUMMY2/p256/p256_289.wav|90|She said she could not believe that they had run away.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_451.wav|75|Miss Jackson was not present to put her case.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_138.wav|10|It will affect their work.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_029.wav|41|They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_166.wav|86|They will do their own thing.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_246.wav|77|On a practical level, it would be difficult.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_312.wav|52|Of course people will try the things they see on TV.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_104.wav|71|"It's not a new concept in jazz."
DUMMY2/p244/p244_244.wav|78|And they were being paid ?
DUMMY2/p345/p345_075.wav|82|The defender made an impressive debut.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_333.wav|76|But when we do it is great.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_320.wav|66|He was released in March this year.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_283.wav|59|The weather forecast isn't good.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_278.wav|97|The bookies have got it about right.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_249.wav|74|We've got to get this right.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_180.wav|98|I'm very happy to be here.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_015.wav|89|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_047.wav|50|A win is a win.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_066.wav|98|Get used to it.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_175.wav|1|Scotland were beaten again.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_393.wav|6|It is for the same reason.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_064.wav|48|They were on holiday in Egypt.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_011.wav|90|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_321.wav|21|What on earth is happening to rugby?
DUMMY2/p273/p273_196.wav|56|British Midland has applied for permission to fly to the US.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_355.wav|5|It is a memorial.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_100.wav|5|That would be unlawful.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_465.wav|63|It is vital to clarify their role.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_383.wav|76|It's always the same, isn't it?
DUMMY2/p316/p316_127.wav|85|Their opening was disastrous.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_106.wav|8|The arrangement will avoid any conflicts of interest.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_295.wav|90|They are a total disgrace to the loyalist cause.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_069.wav|38|There is a tunnel after the tunnel.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_060.wav|92|Social workers are on stand-by to help.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_023.wav|86|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_217.wav|84|I had relied on him.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_376.wav|51|The wealth of talent in Australia is awesome.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_198.wav|28|These people just lost their child.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_367.wav|82|By now he was very ill with cancer.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_315.wav|15|So other options had to be explored.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_125.wav|94|I could see his desire for the job in his eyes.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_156.wav|96|It is an attitude of mind.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_355.wav|98|It's been such a waste of money.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_107.wav|93|It's in his blood.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_158.wav|14|Anyone can do the sums.)
DUMMY2/p334/p334_402.wav|38|The report is due out next month.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_186.wav|76|Sponsors include the Sunday Herald.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_099.wav|61|By that time, however, it was already too late.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_360.wav|46|No, it's actually in a block of flats.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_308.wav|76|It was a simple question.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_235.wav|21|The players are obviously keen to do well.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_019.wav|60|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_262.wav|7|I have never heard a rule that you could be too young.)
DUMMY2/p293/p293_233.wav|23|They had four children together.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_134.wav|15|The building was starting to come down.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_045.wav|14|Everything is possible in football.)
DUMMY2/p341/p341_279.wav|66|Is it the players, or is it the coaches?
DUMMY2/p267/p267_083.wav|0|There was no way back for United after that.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_024.wav|72|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_162.wav|69|Well, he should know.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_133.wav|70|It plans to return to this field.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_319.wav|16|Your father was a good man.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_039.wav|35|This will save interest charges.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_174.wav|86|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_144.wav|33|But it will be sorted out this week.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_249.wav|104|But it was a pleasure.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_316.wav|21|She went home from school and never returned.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_325.wav|18|I really have to go now.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_118.wav|64|I wouldn't want to miss that chance.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_001.wav|101|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_034.wav|24|Smoking is also very important.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_077.wav|61|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_070.wav|64|The crowd was awesome.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_098.wav|13|The real issue is personal.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_192.wav|40|It is a farce.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_009.wav|10|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_165.wav|106|He removed the rubble with the help of passers-by.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_325.wav|87|You are a great player.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_320.wav|54|We cannot rely on protracted legal proceedings.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_323.wav|55|We have clearly become well established.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_099.wav|95|However, it did not end that way.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_370.wav|45|The eye was badly closed on Sunday.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_037.wav|2|They're just different.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_344.wav|1|Our biggest threat is the BBC.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_324.wav|95|What form did that take ?
DUMMY2/p237/p237_344.wav|61|The train was on time.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_118.wav|92|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_472.wav|24|He certainly did a good job!
DUMMY2/p340/p340_327.wav|74|Is that what it's about?
DUMMY2/p238/p238_430.wav|37|We accept the new rules.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_060.wav|52|It was a day she thought she would never see.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_050.wav|47|I guess I was lucky, though.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_214.wav|62|Nobody, if he has anything to do with it.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_171.wav|49|There's still time for that.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_099.wav|81|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_202.wav|31|We must keep our feet on the ground.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_267.wav|17|It's such a trial!
DUMMY2/p272/p272_361.wav|69|They have not done so this season so far.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_216.wav|92|I don't know how they make the weight.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_352.wav|21|At the moment, Michael is in a class of his own.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_213.wav|2|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_208.wav|75|Tony Blair's official spokesman said.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_147.wav|14|My daughter is an adult.)
DUMMY2/p339/p339_291.wav|18|Was that not awful?
DUMMY2/p293/p293_040.wav|23|Just watch the videos and you'll see it.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_124.wav|18|We are doing very well as we are.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_101.wav|57|I love the Dome.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_414.wav|79|I am still waiting for a reply.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_346.wav|99|Tyson is overwhelmed.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_353.wav|101|THE pain was almost too much to bear.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_187.wav|90|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_001.wav|30|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_024.wav|9|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_450.wav|95|We went straight into the bedroom.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_299.wav|21|I was totally wrong.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_242.wav|4|It was just above the roof.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_124.wav|87|We shall rely on human beings.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_047.wav|7|He looks like an Afghan.)
DUMMY2/p239/p239_214.wav|48|The music is therefore profoundly subversive.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_260.wav|74|They were his words.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_170.wav|32|But the petrol station does not get the benefit.)
DUMMY2/p271/p271_012.wav|27|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_333.wav|57|I've got no secret.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_221.wav|61|I do not want to have a fight with Mr Hastings.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_116.wav|39|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_119.wav|106|It's very bad timing, but it's happened.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_252.wav|80|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_443.wav|7|My aim is a top six finish.)
DUMMY2/p281/p281_137.wav|36|We have seen a copy of the report.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_077.wav|87|We have to keep our clients.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_231.wav|86|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_165.wav|91|I am aware that somebody made a threat.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_111.wav|105|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_279.wav|91|There is no substitute.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_171.wav|29|The people are the hero.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_039.wav|78|She was there for the start of the campaign.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_227.wav|22|The team this year is going places.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_093.wav|18|We did it in one take.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_474.wav|14|They were impressive against France.)
DUMMY2/p336/p336_101.wav|98|That is unlikely to happen.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_156.wav|9|I saw one body.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_049.wav|26|We were surprised to see the photograph.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_250.wav|50|The baby deserves the credit.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_159.wav|7|The two companies were not for sale.)
DUMMY2/p238/p238_397.wav|37|Six games without defeat is the legacy so far.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_052.wav|30|He served in the Gulf, the Falklands, and Northern Ireland.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_091.wav|62|But these things are happening now.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_132.wav|91|She was making a living, but her career was going nowhere.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_413.wav|11|I don't make it mystical.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_234.wav|39|It's just a normal life.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_048.wav|88|The trial will open today.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_052.wav|104|The course record was in his name.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_144.wav|66|He is a very nice man.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_323.wav|16|Henman has been warned.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_074.wav|18|It is surprising to come back this way.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_135.wav|92|He added, We have the same desire.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_334.wav|106|I was inspired by two things.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_247.wav|90|We will need to study the report before any decision is taken.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_323.wav|95|The Project is far from that.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_126.wav|17|This is just one example.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_201.wav|41|We have an election in eight days.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_053.wav|12|Retirement, who knows?
DUMMY2/p334/p334_240.wav|38|Downing Street defended the scale of the awards.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_300.wav|78|Scotland won by six wickets.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_276.wav|3|The performance continues to improve.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_193.wav|40|Peace was won.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_053.wav|107|We have to reinforce the pressure on Iraq.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_124.wav|33|But that isn't what is worrying the Farmer.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_093.wav|62|They should be swept away.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_051.wav|41|We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_254.wav|18|It's about taking risks.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_060.wav|106|Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_065.wav|47|The end result is precisely the same.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_025.wav|71|"It's a relief that a decision has finally been made."
DUMMY2/p233/p233_386.wav|84|That set the tone.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_114.wav|90|It was the eighties.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_104.wav|26|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_046.wav|98|My office is down there.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_114.wav|74|It was a question of patience.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_056.wav|32|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.)
DUMMY2/p264/p264_050.wav|65|The Office is a show about nothing, then.)
DUMMY2/p252/p252_218.wav|55|Her experience is certainly limited.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_253.wav|37|What was the matter for concern ?
DUMMY2/p323/p323_172.wav|34|It was not a beautiful game, was it?
DUMMY2/p314/p314_180.wav|51|I cannot speak on behalf of the IRA.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_345.wav|84|Eight months later, he was dead.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_286.wav|101|I wanted to change the formula.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_046.wav|104|Who was the mystery MP?
DUMMY2/p243/p243_142.wav|53|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_211.wav|15|I was so relieved.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_379.wav|40|It looked like a river.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_140.wav|60|We are trying to be realistic.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_230.wav|95|The early physical reports were clear.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_160.wav|64|We are not moving in.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_241.wav|36|We played them off the pitch.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_156.wav|56|I always felt they played for me.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_247.wav|97|I saw it at a ruck.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_187.wav|26|The procedure is the same in all cases.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_171.wav|0|It is a body blow.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_213.wav|16|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_420.wav|107|This would discourage investment and job creation.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_060.wav|35|It's not covered by the insurance.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_203.wav|87|There was a fine line to tread.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_264.wav|100|My husband was born in Zimbabwe.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_225.wav|9|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_010.wav|103|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_250.wav|57|I can't get a job.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_334.wav|6|The board is currently resolving its differences.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_043.wav|58|I've learned from my mistakes.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_206.wav|90|It was worth a photograph.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_215.wav|78|A team is a team.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_286.wav|26|This is a national crisis.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_018.wav|14|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. )
DUMMY2/p334/p334_244.wav|38|Basically, the classical tradition won out.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_010.wav|56|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_395.wav|55|There's always a case.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_261.wav|52|Every player goes through this after a serious injury.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_357.wav|49|All our thoughts and prayers are with them.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_190.wav|82|I was never alone with her, right?
DUMMY2/p301/p301_246.wav|91|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_273.wav|91|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_379.wav|16|The task is enormous.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_201.wav|48|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_382.wav|48|Murray Johnstone will replace it.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_010.wav|44|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_325.wav|93|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_350.wav|81|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_360.wav|12|She looked very, very poor.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_202.wav|79|He should be careful.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_089.wav|17|She may even appear in some more films.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_205.wav|92|It seems a waste of talents.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_325.wav|1|The plot is changing as time goes on.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_205.wav|39|And they were being paid ?
DUMMY2/p231/p231_007.wav|50|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_205.wav|18|We were never told it was already decided.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_351.wav|82|There was no discussion about it.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_399.wav|15|That is why he is so special.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_252.wav|31|It's only fair.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_095.wav|67|Until you hit the big games.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_066.wav|63|It is a great feeling right now.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_154.wav|89|I was so nervous.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_402.wav|103|People ask about the concept of a team.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_102.wav|36|Movement has to take place.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_432.wav|7|A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.)
DUMMY2/p361/p361_331.wav|79|It will be fine.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_337.wav|86|I must make that clear.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_118.wav|55|Now the life of this orchestra is very difficult.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_350.wav|8|This statement has never been withdrawn.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_068.wav|10|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_007.wav|107|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_362.wav|32|We are in a global market.)
DUMMY2/p255/p255_379.wav|31|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_160.wav|85|It was like a dream to be here.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_060.wav|49|These findings would be made public.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_350.wav|73|So there, we won.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_297.wav|49|Law abiding motorists have nothing to fear.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_375.wav|48|This should come as no surprise.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_349.wav|73|Safety was also an issue.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_013.wav|57|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_115.wav|68|I'd like to take the plunge.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_164.wav|107|But they will not be compelled to join.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_435.wav|56|Their condition is described as satisfactory.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_349.wav|75|We put our bid in last night.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_053.wav|15|We've always had three options, and none of them are perfect.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_074.wav|31|I've got the shirt.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_064.wav|64|It has been blown out of all proportion.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_180.wav|9|We knew nothing about it.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_084.wav|81|They lived for their children.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_068.wav|47|That was the easy election.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_284.wav|28|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_062.wav|43|This is a scheme that has a lot of potential.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_152.wav|83|The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_361.wav|100|They are now out in the cold.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_235.wav|100|Corporate banking would be based in Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_048.wav|26|I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_255.wav|16|Is that a serious question?
DUMMY2/p245/p245_097.wav|59|It was an adventure.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_008.wav|49|These take the shape of a long round arc, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_264.wav|52|The two companies were not for sale.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_004.wav|60|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_251.wav|38|They were outstanding and thoroughly deserved their win.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_411.wav|40|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_290.wav|32|It has the potential to be another North Sea.)
DUMMY2/p282/p282_257.wav|83|There's not much money in cycling.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_232.wav|89|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_274.wav|69|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_088.wav|64|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_328.wav|64|And now he tells us.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_172.wav|58|Jamming would be equally difficult.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_111.wav|7|Our offer represents an attractive price for the business.)
DUMMY2/p230/p230_086.wav|35|We will deal with the refugees.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_071.wav|68|The cause of the crash was unclear.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_290.wav|74|It wasn't really like that at all.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_178.wav|18|The funding is now there.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_142.wav|91|We are both very confused and extremely angry.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_103.wav|71|"According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland."
DUMMY2/p293/p293_298.wav|23|The red card was okay.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_369.wav|72|He had no problem with alcohol.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_263.wav|53|The same trend showed up throughout Britain.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_398.wav|2|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_180.wav|73|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_097.wav|4|The initial report has been completed.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_144.wav|98|He's got me very well.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_134.wav|98|His commitment, on the other hand, is clear.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_201.wav|87|You are a gambling man.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_054.wav|28|His voice is strong.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_390.wav|74|It is a challenge for all of us.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_334.wav|12|We will be homeless.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_002.wav|78|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_205.wav|47|Saddam Hussein is a devil.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_133.wav|6|Many other areas are coming up.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_261.wav|1|This would discourage investment and job creation.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_227.wav|69|Three weeks later, he resigned.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_134.wav|82|The shooting created panic in the street.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_183.wav|36|I can't even get into the A team.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_200.wav|93|But we are not immune to the problem.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_214.wav|79|The squad is too small.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_011.wav|15|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_009.wav|45|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_033.wav|8|That is the face of fear.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_077.wav|32|There may be reasons for it.)
DUMMY2/p246/p246_300.wav|5|He was at home with his pals.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_199.wav|17|Or so we have long assumed.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_105.wav|36|It's not a lack of confidence.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_084.wav|26|They are different types.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_282.wav|4|Awareness in Europe of Scotland is high.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_134.wav|51|I'm not holding the club to ransom.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_482.wav|48|The death toll included five children.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_162.wav|62|Sex is fun?
DUMMY2/p363/p363_338.wav|6|It seems to go down well.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_309.wav|100|We will deliver at director level.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_100.wav|58|If you could have dinner with anyone, who would it be?
DUMMY2/p307/p307_406.wav|22|Jackson may well be right.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_137.wav|4|I get the bus.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_328.wav|54|It is anything but erotic, but that is probably the point.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_117.wav|99|Maybe this battle has been.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_265.wav|8|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_073.wav|99|Neither it is.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_356.wav|19|You have obviously got an answer to it.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_118.wav|85|I think they have to change that.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_062.wav|4|It has been declared.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_034.wav|3|It's really no great surprise, because the price difference is so much.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_377.wav|97|And Rangers think they have problems.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_066.wav|26|The price cuts are really exciting.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_241.wav|4|It may not be life long.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_411.wav|107|Sutton is playing as well as ever today.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_024.wav|52|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_008.wav|16|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_275.wav|34|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_173.wav|91|Our young people are leaving.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_399.wav|104|It's very simple, no-one is forced to compete.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_245.wav|67|The sanctions are about collective punishment.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_014.wav|86|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_345.wav|17|That is not the way we should operate.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_236.wav|58|I had another good day.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_064.wav|94|They are real.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_315.wav|102|A great deal has been achieved.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_173.wav|77|Our destiny is in our own hands.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_259.wav|53|Policy making would become a role for ministers and their officials.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_173.wav|73|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_300.wav|49|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_044.wav|93|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_351.wav|70|My husband was angry.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_201.wav|38|Tony Blair is obviously panicking.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_155.wav|104|You feel the pride.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_155.wav|10|I knew he was good.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_079.wav|5|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_413.wav|98|He didn't know it was his audition, but it was.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_162.wav|105|A Labour insider said it was far too close to call.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_042.wav|26|We need to chat.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_408.wav|89|He has written to the minister after meetings on the island.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_096.wav|51|Hopefully, it will pay off for me.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_339.wav|69|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_015.wav|10|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_178.wav|57|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_328.wav|89|I've got no secret.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_343.wav|84|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_185.wav|37|But we could only help a handful of people.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_108.wav|7|It is a good lifestyle.)
DUMMY2/p288/p288_410.wav|47|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_276.wav|90|I am an estate agent.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_002.wav|77|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_313.wav|52|For that reason cover should not be given.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_374.wav|70|Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_063.wav|20|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
DUMMY2/p237/p237_215.wav|61|Failure to react to each one could mean a disaster.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_005.wav|60|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_363.wav|100|My view has now completely changed.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_009.wav|23|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_056.wav|106|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_230.wav|73|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_264.wav|37|It is a terrible tragedy.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_067.wav|81|That was a gold medal for certain.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_390.wav|32|Glasgow University declined to comment.)
DUMMY2/p364/p364_012.wav|88|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_297.wav|9|I am an estate agent.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_271.wav|51|I watched a game.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_139.wav|70|I don't know the full story.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_402.wav|25|What would be the point?
DUMMY2/p262/p262_235.wav|45|But it's a subtle process.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_204.wav|39|Or was it ?
DUMMY2/p274/p274_350.wav|32|Other people had looked at it.)
DUMMY2/p278/p278_356.wav|10|Finally came the moment of truth.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_162.wav|16|They are not advertised.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_015.wav|16|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_017.wav|14|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. )
DUMMY2/p248/p248_137.wav|99|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_051.wav|27|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_343.wav|24|I'm not making any specific attempt on the world record.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_340.wav|50|At first, the youngster was not keen.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_370.wav|87|He ended up a headmaster.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_013.wav|71|"Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. "
DUMMY2/p267/p267_089.wav|0|The rescue package is public money.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_114.wav|29|But we could only help a handful of people.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_215.wav|99|In each case they were a goal down.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_342.wav|69|Another case of foot-and-mouth disease was confirmed in Scotland yesterday.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_314.wav|69|It's too horrible to think.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_343.wav|3|The market is the market.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_077.wav|0|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_401.wav|96|It is legally binding.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_284.wav|32|My main intention was to write a funny comedy.)
DUMMY2/p232/p232_071.wav|96|Painful, but only because it's true.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_418.wav|56|That might mean another delay.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_268.wav|3|Then was the summer of their discontent.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_167.wav|37|We can't get over it.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_062.wav|65|It happens from time to time.)
DUMMY2/p286/p286_395.wav|63|After the match, do you ?
DUMMY2/p326/p326_253.wav|28|The real problem is the Usher Hall.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_264.wav|18|There are no plans to change this.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_165.wav|99|We knew we had the goal we wanted.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_134.wav|85|She is not the world champion.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_415.wav|11|Neither could be contacted last night.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_037.wav|89|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_165.wav|61|He was the Bill Gates of theatre.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_240.wav|8|We were a shambles at the back.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_107.wav|22|The little boy was playing football at lunchtime.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_283.wav|72|Teachers have been given the offer.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_123.wav|65|It seemed like four hours.)
DUMMY2/p298/p298_130.wav|68|Above all the aggression must be stopped.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_281.wav|73|This is a national crisis.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_268.wav|83|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_018.wav|37|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_173.wav|51|We've got the top three.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_185.wav|50|As many as the market will support.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_194.wav|23|A final decision is expected by Friday.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_172.wav|55|We have come a long way since then.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_005.wav|23|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_247.wav|5|It was a hit.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_297.wav|17|We are being hijacked.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_036.wav|20|A quality audit officer has also been appointed.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_266.wav|57|Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_274.wav|105|Who did the recruiting?
DUMMY2/p351/p351_039.wav|33|I have got a wife to feed.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_127.wav|70|She really suffered for her art.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_110.wav|106|Talk of a crisis is absurd.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_301.wav|62|There will be no exceptions to this rule.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_142.wav|33|The other question is why the scaling down?
DUMMY2/p323/p323_034.wav|34|Meantime, the department is proposing structural changes.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_113.wav|14|Our offer represents an attractive price for the business.)
DUMMY2/p259/p259_420.wav|7|It's too close to call.)
DUMMY2/p330/p330_163.wav|1|I was delighted with every one of them.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_200.wav|85|Arsenal refused to be evicted.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_003.wav|33|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_038.wav|90|They're just different.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_115.wav|19|Such a policy would be a disaster.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_115.wav|60|It has no place in football.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_369.wav|98|Eriksson would have approved.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_139.wav|89|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_080.wav|7|Our mother is very worried.)
DUMMY2/p333/p333_239.wav|64|I want to play at the highest level.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_069.wav|73|Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_049.wav|4|What would you do if you didn't work?
DUMMY2/p334/p334_209.wav|38|It is the stop-gap before extinction.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_056.wav|92|He is helping police with their inquiries.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_350.wav|13|What's the problem with change?
DUMMY2/p279/p279_382.wav|25|It's like a basketball.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_215.wav|40|He seemed to lose his focus.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_389.wav|27|Public confidence was undermined by that terrible tragedy.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_334.wav|55|Does that put pressure on us ?
DUMMY2/p233/p233_129.wav|84|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_198.wav|86|He has a lot of experience as captain in his career.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_173.wav|18|I was very influenced by him.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_369.wav|17|I just couldn't believe what had happened.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_335.wav|76|I didn't want to fall out with anyone.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_315.wav|62|She has left the island.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_094.wav|60|It's nice to be involved.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_346.wav|76|My heart is not so sure.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_079.wav|33|This youngster is so exciting!
DUMMY2/p298/p298_192.wav|68|I think we finished fifth.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_180.wav|93|They will run a mile.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_088.wav|42|Do something that you haven't done before.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_392.wav|20|A parliament for England is the only way to redress the balance.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_252.wav|84|A friendship that will endure.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_049.wav|98|It was a joy.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_167.wav|4|They haven't been thought through.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_190.wav|7|That's not fair to the supporters.)
DUMMY2/p310/p310_066.wav|17|Hopefully they will just give me the degree.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_152.wav|94|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_271.wav|77|This is a question of Islam.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_191.wav|39|The championship is different from the other majors.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_357.wav|82|I was utterly hopeless at it, it must be said.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_191.wav|91|We are seeking funds from government departments.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_186.wav|36|I am not ready to walk away.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_440.wav|37|Princess Margaret is being buried on that day.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_423.wav|48|It tells the story of a woman who has probably been abused.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_246.wav|41|He got the same story.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_221.wav|89|Dewar was certainly under attack from within his own party.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_160.wav|88|He has gone back to school.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_206.wav|47|Feel the heat?
DUMMY2/p273/p273_128.wav|56|The findings are published in the British Journal of Cancer.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_219.wav|34|We had a huge response to that campaign.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_013.wav|3|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_313.wav|42|Mr Mason is claiming unfair dismissal.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_221.wav|44|We have our supporters and our enemies.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_414.wav|0|These guys are looking for business.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_181.wav|2|Nothing is safe.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_309.wav|38|Again, it's about responding to your resources.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_206.wav|63|I think, therefore I am ?
DUMMY2/p326/p326_096.wav|28|We are very very proud of Alain.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_129.wav|82|That will be the case on Tuesday.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_358.wav|72|This is not a birthday party.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_344.wav|98|Fifteen minutes later, they were found.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_327.wav|11|The biggest thing is structure.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_303.wav|35|Again the parallel with football can be drawn.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_212.wav|104|I have no secrets.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_358.wav|67|There is a cup final at stake.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_259.wav|76|Perhaps we should do the same.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_025.wav|82|This is a new era.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_289.wav|83|I was brought up in a mining background.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_014.wav|102|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_084.wav|83|I first met him last summer.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_354.wav|51|There is access for disabled people.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_164.wav|38|That's as it should be.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_168.wav|85|That happens in boxing.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_386.wav|54|It is the logical extension of audio description.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_311.wav|45|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_374.wav|76|I'm a little bit tired.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_237.wav|21|It's really good fun.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_319.wav|68|They had previously been on five-day notice.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_241.wav|5|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_063.wav|31|We should have known.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_275.wav|102|She is a very lucky young lady.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_212.wav|36|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_305.wav|96|They are wrong.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_396.wav|32|There was a substantial explosion.)
DUMMY2/p347/p347_400.wav|46|There is no margin for error.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_040.wav|70|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_443.wav|63|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_378.wav|53|He had got himself into trouble with money and needed money.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_182.wav|5|Does this matter?
DUMMY2/p236/p236_275.wav|75|That could be in place by next year.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_338.wav|47|The same things will happen with GM foods.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_358.wav|27|My husband was angry.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_400.wav|51|This is usually done by the space shuttle.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_131.wav|42|Three penalties were given.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_138.wav|84|Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_093.wav|52|They had the appeal of TV stars.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_095.wav|64|Whatever the final decision, one thing is certain.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_111.wav|74|But we still don't know.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_064.wav|63|They have to come up with a solution.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_293.wav|53|They first met during a Step in London.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_043.wav|105|The boy is no longer with us.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_070.wav|52|But during the bid process, that changed completely.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_100.wav|94|May not have been at fault?
DUMMY2/p279/p279_219.wav|25|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_356.wav|68|Staff should be paid for what they produce.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_110.wav|102|I am prepared to step down.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_148.wav|17|Each one has its own system.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_201.wav|47|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_005.wav|78|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_053.wav|102|Retirement, who knows?
DUMMY2/p335/p335_013.wav|49|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_325.wav|19|Players are fighting to stay in the team.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_320.wav|95|Hopefully, this week will be good.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_010.wav|22|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_170.wav|51|They've got to get better.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_123.wav|99|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_069.wav|9|There could be a way back.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_272.wav|78|He must have a crack at it.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_348.wav|38|I am content with the silver.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_025.wav|78|We are a service industry.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_396.wav|28|A great deal has been achieved.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_132.wav|58|Where is the anthrax?
DUMMY2/p335/p335_106.wav|49|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_116.wav|44|Lately, that market has come under pressure.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_104.wav|50|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
DUMMY2/p312/p312_104.wav|62|I could not believe it.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_373.wav|9|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_147.wav|79|It seems to have been an own goal.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_045.wav|77|I saw them last week.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_176.wav|84|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_091.wav|94|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_128.wav|104|I can't speak for him.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_293.wav|50|This could be a mistake.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_121.wav|89|The mood is upbeat.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_153.wav|54|He will do so today in Monte Carlo.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_240.wav|44|They had four children together.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_049.wav|58|Usually, you should leave it alone in the box.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_205.wav|8|We believe a third party was involved.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_100.wav|43|They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_120.wav|89|It is so sad.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_074.wav|0|That is bound to happen.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_390.wav|45|It was on fire.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_111.wav|94|The picture is the same across Scotland.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_044.wav|72|Scottish sport was not mentioned.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_048.wav|48|Alliance Leicester would give it a presence in southern England.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_190.wav|67|I drove the ball well.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_376.wav|99|A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_322.wav|76|But will they fall in love?
DUMMY2/p245/p245_205.wav|59|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_227.wav|46|She will also get a pay rise.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_130.wav|81|It plans to return to this field.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_354.wav|7|He will go a long way.)
DUMMY2/p267/p267_193.wav|0|If I was a woman.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_048.wav|68|I didn't know the company all that well, or the dancers.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_019.wav|95|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_306.wav|96|It is a road of death.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_369.wav|37|The statement contained no surprises.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_235.wav|96|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_349.wav|12|She has seen, or heard, it all.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_358.wav|51|It is like a theatre of the absurd.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_211.wav|36|The sanctions are about collective punishment.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_064.wav|71|"George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision."
DUMMY2/p314/p314_074.wav|51|All the lads are totally focused on that.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_125.wav|32|Was it the wife ?)
DUMMY2/p271/p271_285.wav|27|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_060.wav|40|It's good news and long overdue.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_392.wav|29|That's not like us at all.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_048.wav|56|I must take a seat.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_314.wav|82|It should not make the same mistake again.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_405.wav|6|This is your chance.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_140.wav|46|It was important to win the singles.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_290.wav|41|It's like a high school play.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_250.wav|70|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_178.wav|78|It sounds like an appalling, tragic incident.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_210.wav|66|He explained to his audience.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_242.wav|102|They were two different types.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_221.wav|62|I love you so very much.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_134.wav|74|That was one very hard game.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_207.wav|58|All inquiries should be made to the police.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_428.wav|95|That is a personal matter.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_345.wav|107|Again, it's about responding to your resources.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_285.wav|21|I can feel the sound inside.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_234.wav|77|They need to win a trophy.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_111.wav|67|It is normal.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_301.wav|60|He will be missed.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_090.wav|43|New Zealand rugby is totally different.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_046.wav|67|But it took a lot of bottle.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_212.wav|61|I don't want to use it.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_198.wav|62|It is a large number.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_228.wav|102|They may yet have the last laugh.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_160.wav|51|Drink and petrol prices remain untouched.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_347.wav|7|Job losses were also announced.)
DUMMY2/p339/p339_189.wav|18|The other was a football match.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_300.wav|32|The palace said the Queen was deeply saddened.)
DUMMY2/p249/p249_087.wav|80|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_029.wav|49|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_023.wav|63|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_330.wav|77|What form did that take ?
DUMMY2/p264/p264_070.wav|65|He has real potential.)
DUMMY2/p312/p312_190.wav|62|We're going to see a Government in a hurry.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_063.wav|3|That could be a mistake.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_204.wav|62|I was on the pitch and everything.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_025.wav|27|She looked so young.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_037.wav|21|It should be the reverse.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_198.wav|83|Is that success?
DUMMY2/p251/p251_344.wav|9|Finally, he paid for the movie.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_136.wav|15|There is enormous interest in Scotland the Brand.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_370.wav|27|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_374.wav|65|It was exactly four months away.)
DUMMY2/p232/p232_190.wav|96|We did everything by the book.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_035.wav|30|How come it is so often unnoticed?
DUMMY2/p283/p283_069.wav|95|We believe a third party was involved.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_240.wav|7|I am considered a teenager.)
DUMMY2/p284/p284_354.wav|16|I HAVE a dream.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_272.wav|16|She looked so young.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_412.wav|74|And Scotland is no different.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_233.wav|19|They hold on for many years.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_121.wav|33|It is a great shame.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_315.wav|76|The odds are that it will.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_309.wav|17|It is just like the stock market.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_299.wav|66|That was enough for the committee.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_303.wav|95|It is the end of an adventure.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_279.wav|70|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_090.wav|74|He said, we're delighted by the vote.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_297.wav|13|You can't get the experience in Austria.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_041.wav|44|For one thing, he was growing far too quickly.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_012.wav|28|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_104.wav|100|It was a funny game.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_099.wav|102|They are, therefore, not in favour of dispersal of sex offenders.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_214.wav|13|Obviously, we would want to look at this.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_025.wav|65|The west coast line is not just for middle England.)
DUMMY2/p252/p252_173.wav|55|Sport is good for you.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_178.wav|46|It's a flourishing and beautiful city.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_104.wav|38|We are not out of touch with politics.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_214.wav|87|Don Hutchison, too, is a threat.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_261.wav|97|We are not too surprised.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_272.wav|88|It was a definite penalty.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_044.wav|97|I feel very sad and extremely cut up.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_153.wav|100|He was asked to quit.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_281.wav|9|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_205.wav|72|Ownership was the game.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_257.wav|30|It didn't take long.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_223.wav|100|My daughter is an adult.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_136.wav|74|I recommend a tour.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_045.wav|38|And we're not there yet.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_147.wav|54|They were even being used by primary pupils.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_425.wav|16|Nato will prevail.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_241.wav|43|They are all bright and different.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_133.wav|79|IT is called a killing in the trade.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_139.wav|25|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_296.wav|42|Actually, it turned out to be the concerto.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_050.wav|82|Suddenly it was, indeed, a new ball game.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_168.wav|5|He was a crazy man.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_308.wav|62|Chris Paterson was outstanding.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_120.wav|20|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_274.wav|5|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_223.wav|37|We were right to be afraid.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_077.wav|30|It is simple, really.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_121.wav|9|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_131.wav|22|She died in hospital two hours later.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_397.wav|75|How are you, sir ?
DUMMY2/p374/p374_388.wav|11|Next league matches, Motherwell - Dundee United.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_321.wav|63|The songs are just so good.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_251.wav|97|That decision was applauded by Williamson.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_089.wav|64|In just a fortnight, however, everything has changed.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_106.wav|83|Oil embargo endorsed.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_011.wav|25|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_133.wav|13|It was even worse than at home.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_024.wav|53|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_382.wav|50|What do they want us to do ?
DUMMY2/p250/p250_116.wav|24|He was prepared for this.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_335.wav|46|They did, too, but it didn't matter by then.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_025.wav|101|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
DUMMY2/p293/p293_170.wav|23|We are concerned that things should be safe.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_346.wav|87|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
DUMMY2/p308/p308_215.wav|107|Is this accurate?
DUMMY2/p254/p254_393.wav|41|I'm pleased about one thing.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_130.wav|5|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_009.wav|71|"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. "
DUMMY2/p317/p317_400.wav|97|It's a very special unit.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_298.wav|34|Both were later released after a check-up.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_175.wav|26|I drove the ball well.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_121.wav|107|The trial is set for February.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_220.wav|99|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_361.wav|17|He's a nice guy.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_112.wav|34|It doesn't make them evil.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_275.wav|104|We've been here before.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_143.wav|33|It was the crowning point of my career.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_042.wav|79|That means an extra two years.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_067.wav|57|An appeal against the sentence was dismissed the following year.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_097.wav|72|But he's not afraid to take risks.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_214.wav|45|He seemed to lose his focus.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_354.wav|35|You have no chance of planning permission.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_217.wav|96|It's not ideal.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_331.wav|15|The time commitment is the biggest thing.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_201.wav|36|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_266.wav|39|We've got a lot of that sort of nonsense in the North-east.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_065.wav|99|Scotland had great assets.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_354.wav|56|He had no previous convictions.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_351.wav|45|There is no link.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_239.wav|71|"The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery."
DUMMY2/p273/p273_244.wav|56|how do you get it back ?
DUMMY2/p363/p363_289.wav|6|You are looking at him.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_063.wav|29|We will pay their bills.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_120.wav|57|I don't want to use the term.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_057.wav|45|New York is expected to come to a standstill.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_262.wav|44|She may even appear in some more films.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_232.wav|80|My neighbours are horrified.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_162.wav|40|She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_257.wav|31|We need to move away from the culture of long hours.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_285.wav|93|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_321.wav|55|We lost to a poor team.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_219.wav|88|It was very, very frightening.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_048.wav|20|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_172.wav|105|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_299.wav|20|We lost a boy.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_117.wav|39|He was jailed for a year.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_378.wav|49|There were three boys and two girls.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_275.wav|89|All options are open.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_325.wav|26|However, the groups denied the claims.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_284.wav|4|Even then this game was not over.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_037.wav|17|It is easy to be wise in hindsight.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_066.wav|86|Try to save us.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_201.wav|84|He may need it.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_031.wav|18|It's about the balance.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_358.wav|104|No decision on that was taken.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_275.wav|72|It used to be less than five minutes.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_144.wav|26|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_279.wav|72|We are not asking for the moon.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_399.wav|38|I'd never seen a play about me.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_242.wav|3|And they were being paid ?
DUMMY2/p307/p307_253.wav|22|JOHN Anderson, the former Scottish national coach, is still unearthing talent.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_321.wav|26|Referees are easy targets.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_103.wav|14|She has so much to offer.)
DUMMY2/p280/p280_100.wav|52|I am delighted to hear this news.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_092.wav|19|The crucial strike was yet to come.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_373.wav|45|We felt at the moment, it was not possible.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_022.wav|91|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_138.wav|69|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_065.wav|66|He had played well in that central role.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_116.wav|84|You had better believe it.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_278.wav|9|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_395.wav|89|It was a breathtaking moment.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_166.wav|30|I was doing well at the hustings.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_010.wav|60|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_354.wav|102|You can leave him, knowing the job will be done.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_254.wav|40|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_280.wav|101|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_020.wav|106|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_032.wav|21|But it might have done.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_065.wav|71|"An appeal against the sentence was dismissed the following year."
DUMMY2/p347/p347_215.wav|46|That was moving the goalposts.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_140.wav|107|How much of a cop out is that?
DUMMY2/p305/p305_310.wav|54|NOW it is official, Barry Ferguson is staying with Rangers.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_121.wav|22|The way they play, it is hard to score against them.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_048.wav|67|I am just going to go for it.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_318.wav|69|I was invited to work in Germany.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_193.wav|19|All these things have an impact.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_224.wav|2|He said the winner had been chosen by consensus.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_410.wav|13|I am looking forward to this film.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_291.wav|66|It was just one of those things.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_183.wav|57|The hotel was now for sale.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_246.wav|74|The time for change is now.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_228.wav|8|They are difficult awards to decide.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_027.wav|100|Because we do not need it.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_341.wav|78|However, a bid was never made.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_091.wav|88|I didn't have the choice.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_104.wav|99|That is no use.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_046.wav|91|She added, It is the same story in both countries.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_052.wav|61|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_339.wav|9|He was not a big name.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_109.wav|97|We understand the changes in the world.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_202.wav|12|Well that's very New Labour, isn't it?
DUMMY2/p228/p228_095.wav|57|Safety was also an issue.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_139.wav|57|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_395.wav|60|They could have been told in advance.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_130.wav|93|Wish I could be there on Sunday in person but I can't.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_156.wav|10|We will turn the corner.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_145.wav|88|It was the rugby writers dinner in London.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_225.wav|30|No meaningful response was issued.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_273.wav|84|Immediate action must be taken.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_407.wav|13|It will probably be my last, too.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_420.wav|105|One must hope not!
DUMMY2/p232/p232_154.wav|96|They were later discharged from hospital.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_214.wav|95|He lives in a neighbouring village.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_081.wav|74|There was a vacuum.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_431.wav|8|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_311.wav|10|Maloney is an engaging talent.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_329.wav|9|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_216.wav|106|What do we want to do that for ?
DUMMY2/p329/p329_084.wav|103|They are currently managed by Ian Wilson.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_265.wav|45|They wanted the club to make money.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_048.wav|38|Times have changed, but have they improved?
DUMMY2/p318/p318_022.wav|19|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_371.wav|34|The problem arises because he does so much.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_278.wav|55|Paul never gave up hope.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_396.wav|6|He will have something to say.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_228.wav|6|But we shall have to talk to him.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_214.wav|89|You should always be able to get out in some direction.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_341.wav|36|It's just the way I play.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_084.wav|79|Drama is not one of them.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_348.wav|72|Thirty people have applied for his job!
DUMMY2/p248/p248_205.wav|99|It was worth a photograph.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_416.wav|62|However, it has had only a limited uptake.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_036.wav|75|If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_111.wav|46|We have to reinforce the pressure on Iraq.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_326.wav|20|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_323.wav|22|Not that Agassi was a believer.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_452.wav|7|In fact, the reasons are simple.)
DUMMY2/p311/p311_334.wav|4|You have to feel for the guy.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_029.wav|13|IT IS the last week of rehearsals.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_417.wav|104|I saw it in a different way.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_450.wav|106|I rejected the idea of a separate residence.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_105.wav|44|Referees are easy targets.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_127.wav|32|What do we want to do that for ?)
DUMMY2/p252/p252_122.wav|55|Consumers will also benefit.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_065.wav|7|We should keep this recent assault in perspective.)
DUMMY2/p310/p310_317.wav|17|Clearly, this was the important nursing.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_051.wav|7|I had trouble with the producers.)
DUMMY2/p245/p245_027.wav|59|It's nice to hear.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_036.wav|33|They also have good neighbours.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_221.wav|48|I was caught out a little bit.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_382.wav|42|I don't want a burial service.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_097.wav|23|It has been hijacked.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_356.wav|29|They were the acts of men.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_258.wav|40|Souter will be back.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_076.wav|77|By then, he was walking on water.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_076.wav|46|You have to rely on each other.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_303.wav|16|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_345.wav|18|His manager blamed the referee.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_109.wav|26|We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_262.wav|29|Our decision making was poor.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_162.wav|84|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_311.wav|99|Other people had looked at it.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_076.wav|8|It was a unanimous decision.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_169.wav|93|They will do their own thing.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_054.wav|9|I had relied on him.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_309.wav|0|Cast Away now on general release.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_345.wav|63|Other musicians were found in retirement.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_101.wav|94|We want to get to the final, anyway.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_211.wav|85|We have a budget in March.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_211.wav|70|Work has started.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_364.wav|70|It is a simple equation.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_186.wav|107|They've two children.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_108.wav|30|Two and a half million people have died.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_177.wav|80|As far as we were concerned the deal with Kennedy was dead.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_283.wav|56|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_002.wav|44|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_251.wav|107|We are not out of touch with politics.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_018.wav|54|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_278.wav|19|Something was plainly wrong.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_161.wav|56|I did not have a bet on myself.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_393.wav|4|She returned home a few days later.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_140.wav|86|She hopes to study in Britain one day.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_347.wav|11|It is coming on very well.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_282.wav|96|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_006.wav|35|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_289.wav|79|I have really noticed that this week.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_215.wav|38|So the European elections are extremely important.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_025.wav|23|It's not, of course, a concert hall.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_256.wav|49|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_081.wav|38|They just thought it was extremely good acting.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_258.wav|12|Today's meeting was open and friendly.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_003.wav|30|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_034.wav|100|This film will be totally awesome.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_397.wav|49|The home team had an amazing start.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_274.wav|21|There was no argument.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_142.wav|45|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_043.wav|20|The shift in public perception about the disease is amazing.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_210.wav|45|The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_236.wav|33|The case was continued.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_240.wav|35|They need to win a trophy.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_030.wav|66|Gilbert was not amused.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_213.wav|7|Is it in the right place ?)
DUMMY2/p264/p264_180.wav|65|I've never had a year like this.)
DUMMY2/p341/p341_277.wav|66|That is a mark of what you are.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_293.wav|43|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_026.wav|89|Is this accurate?
DUMMY2/p269/p269_135.wav|94|The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_366.wav|97|We could easily be cut again.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_143.wav|68|Over the last four years, we have been fairly consistent.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_066.wav|36|The tournament has now been cancelled.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_260.wav|51|I am deeply sorry they did.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_308.wav|16|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_134.wav|9|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_085.wav|31|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_204.wav|107|Have we not had the rainy season already?
DUMMY2/p299/p299_249.wav|58|She had kept the news from him.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_041.wav|6|The impact was immediate.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_077.wav|74|Two options are being proposed.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_140.wav|10|They could use a boost.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_049.wav|102|It is also central to the unfolding drama.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_247.wav|95|These will take a little time to develop.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_337.wav|67|They haven't got a hope.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_034.wav|97|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_136.wav|30|Do you think they would be any better?
DUMMY2/p340/p340_026.wav|74|We are not prepared to do that.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_121.wav|31|I can't even get into the A team.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_170.wav|78|We have to create it in the playing strength of the team.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_057.wav|25|Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_442.wav|106|Not many people like to do that.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_234.wav|48|We will turn the corner.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_263.wav|1|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_230.wav|1|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_379.wav|17|That is why it's so lyrical.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_017.wav|35|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_345.wav|8|So what is the campaign about ?
DUMMY2/p374/p374_422.wav|11|Next year this time  we will be home.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_021.wav|25|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_250.wav|21|Actually, nothing much will change.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_331.wav|101|Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_265.wav|100|This idea has been around for four years.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_267.wav|64|I was just overwhelmed.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_121.wav|17|And who were they anyway, beforehand?
DUMMY2/p311/p311_124.wav|4|This is a most serious matter.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_036.wav|81|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_177.wav|66|This is a huge confidence boost.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_217.wav|52|I do not see this so much as failure.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_056.wav|72|I'm very angry about it.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_111.wav|1|You just know it.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_415.wav|77|I am astonished at attack.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_027.wav|91|You need a long-term strategy in football.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_084.wav|21|I didn't understand it.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_416.wav|107|I haven't spoken to anyone about that, not even my wife.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_194.wav|59|He knows a lot.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_358.wav|29|Of course, we want to go home.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_171.wav|50|To get good people, you need to offer them enough money.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_377.wav|72|We are in the hat.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_108.wav|84|In London today, it was business as usual.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_184.wav|100|Equally, he is grateful to have survived the cull.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_022.wav|40|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_007.wav|69|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_286.wav|99|But it is understood to have happened after weeks of arguments.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_184.wav|69|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_320.wav|45|In fact, they have the opposite effect.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_232.wav|38|To all intents and purposes, he ran the show.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_233.wav|52|They should realise the chairman wants a deputy he can trust.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_316.wav|36|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_358.wav|106|Is there a waiting list ?
DUMMY2/p305/p305_294.wav|54|This comes down to a problem of arrogance.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_111.wav|3|That would be decided at the interim results in November, he added.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_066.wav|48|Everything is possible in football.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_473.wav|14|We will now look into its historical background.)
DUMMY2/p262/p262_137.wav|45|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_347.wav|41|That is a break with tradition.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_099.wav|96|They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_077.wav|16|Even the one she loved.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_367.wav|41|They received a reply from their own managers.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_414.wav|51|I don't believe that money is the answer.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_115.wav|33|The way forward isn't going to be easy.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_355.wav|52|It is not a material issue for a group with our strength.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_248.wav|18|But that is for another day.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_399.wav|22|This is usually done by the space shuttle.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_184.wav|85|Actually, it's an amazing orchestra.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_256.wav|39|The deal is expected to be completed by next summer.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_246.wav|90|Some families have even requested to leave the city.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_064.wav|105|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
DUMMY2/p335/p335_194.wav|49|We are aware of the tribunal case.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_098.wav|55|We're at home, which is important.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_046.wav|96|The judge said.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_200.wav|54|He would help me with the form.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_239.wav|24|It is good for our team.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_094.wav|76|It was forced to divert.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_015.wav|107|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_040.wav|59|It's a great thing.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_012.wav|37|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_349.wav|79|But then the problems began.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_021.wav|65|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. )
DUMMY2/p310/p310_082.wav|17|They don't work anymore anyway.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_309.wav|52|It had happened on average once a week this year.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_244.wav|61|We are in the hat.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_006.wav|69|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_225.wav|97|I can't deny that fact.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_111.wav|76|It's just one of those things.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_142.wav|77|It would seem a natural progression.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_139.wav|86|If people are genuine, then the problem is not Osama bin Laden.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_293.wav|64|Debbie Harry was cool.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_182.wav|41|We did everything by the book.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_124.wav|86|It has removed a bit of guilt.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_095.wav|13|They should come clean.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_412.wav|14|How do you take them away ?)
DUMMY2/p330/p330_324.wav|1|We've had our problems at the club.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_064.wav|29|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_318.wav|102|Too often it is not.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_130.wav|3|We are committed to the ban.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_031.wav|5|This is the window.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_101.wav|50|That time is not now, however.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_251.wav|44|We're trying to lessen the stigma.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_204.wav|61|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_291.wav|15|Let us hope it doesn't come to that.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_407.wav|66|However, the report was incorrect.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_303.wav|64|I made a mistake.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_352.wav|84|Hartley should know.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_179.wav|61|He was a crazy man.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_286.wav|52|In fact, I have been a bit of a terrorist to the council.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_071.wav|28|The success story shows no signs of stopping.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_041.wav|35|He looks like an Afghan.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_160.wav|36|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_274.wav|50|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_036.wav|36|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_367.wav|96|He has seen the past.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_357.wav|35|The professor said the results were positive.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_247.wav|45|The scene is about this?
DUMMY2/p335/p335_372.wav|49|At the moment, it is being treated as a tragic accident.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_232.wav|102|For the other parties, it is back to business as usual.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_322.wav|59|The boat was fantastic.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_469.wav|14|Now that business is banned.)
DUMMY2/p231/p231_029.wav|50|Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_034.wav|63|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_272.wav|47|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_263.wav|20|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_467.wav|65|This is a big advantage.)
DUMMY2/p226/p226_132.wav|43|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_070.wav|23|I was shaking on the blocks.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_230.wav|5|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_229.wav|76|It doesn't take much.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_334.wav|105|It is not like working for a living.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_092.wav|8|We haven't finished the complaints procedure.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_370.wav|33|It is a very big problem.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_324.wav|104|I told you so.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_355.wav|54|It has, however, been a long time coming.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_323.wav|83|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_003.wav|15|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_061.wav|29|There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_065.wav|6|Sentencing is also being considered in that review.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_156.wav|103|There has been no cover-up - just the opposite in fact.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_342.wav|38|I knew he was dying.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_100.wav|99|That would be unlawful.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_162.wav|15|So is the rest of British sport.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_108.wav|72|Nine other passengers were treated at the scene.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_101.wav|85|The rest was badminton.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_011.wav|93|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_052.wav|28|My position on the euro is quite clear.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_071.wav|0|Last night, the move was bitterly denounced by France Telecom.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_116.wav|87|Harrowing is easy, after all.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_239.wav|83|Our policy is clear.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_254.wav|85|It opened last month.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_324.wav|9|You are the glory.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_020.wav|39|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_115.wav|97|He had done his homework properly.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_095.wav|4|Everyone is working together to resolve the problems.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_299.wav|47|However, the snow was welcomed by some.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_315.wav|46|We hope this scheme will change that.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_375.wav|93|We are looking for perfection.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_298.wav|28|The observer saw no evidence ofr fighting.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_178.wav|39|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_073.wav|87|The wingers must have felt the cold.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_131.wav|83|I am now unemployed.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_302.wav|20|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_374.wav|99|He's a lovely young man.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_390.wav|16|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_291.wav|85|We have been going for three years.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_089.wav|27|They lived for their children.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_039.wav|79|It took two minutes to respond.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_086.wav|88|I said How much?
DUMMY2/p270/p270_441.wav|8|It is not over by any means.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_155.wav|7|It opens the door to the Champions League.)
DUMMY2/p286/p286_410.wav|63|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_210.wav|8|This decision will prove to be the opposite of a standstill.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_312.wav|53|Of course people will try the things they see on TV.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_400.wav|91|Anyway, even if they didn't it wouldn't have mattered.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_248.wav|83|That could be in place by next year.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_040.wav|22|Hopefully they will just give me the degree.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_011.wav|80|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_094.wav|52|There is no issue of national security involved here.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_055.wav|72|I guess it is down to focus.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_145.wav|6|We could easily have lost that game.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_159.wav|105|He can do no wrong.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_080.wav|39|And does it ?
DUMMY2/p343/p343_400.wav|21|I love the feel of the place.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_104.wav|65|Jack was always going to win this one.)
DUMMY2/p351/p351_392.wav|33|This is the last straw.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_087.wav|76|Dunfermline deserved a goal for their hard work.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_055.wav|104|We should not bring him into a dispute.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_004.wav|30|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_251.wav|23|Also, he was flawed.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_039.wav|99|It was clear.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_164.wav|26|Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_309.wav|104|You could see he was thinking about it.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_089.wav|35|However, a decision should be made before the end of August.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_348.wav|12|It is a simple equation.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_127.wav|3|However, it was a different story in the final.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_383.wav|51|Scotland is too small a country for that.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_244.wav|106|People have been wonderful beyond belief.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_141.wav|3|When we played them last year, we were beaten by the weather.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_322.wav|33|At the moment, it is very difficult to know.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_311.wav|79|A winter of discontent awaits.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_461.wav|75|It will determine whether an offence has occurred.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_408.wav|96|Feel the air, the space.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_334.wav|21|It is my last chance.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_183.wav|77|You know the sort of thing.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_144.wav|25|Is that Titanic?
DUMMY2/p244/p244_212.wav|78|Hopefully, it will bring new customers.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_323.wav|1|The committee's remit is far reaching.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_195.wav|47|Is that success?
DUMMY2/p339/p339_300.wav|18|Who was on the panel?
DUMMY2/p262/p262_349.wav|45|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_013.wav|24|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_163.wav|92|Everyone is taking a breath and waiting.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_006.wav|57|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_091.wav|63|Why do it otherwise ?
DUMMY2/p374/p374_231.wav|11|I suspect that it will.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_270.wav|105|It was a privilege to work for him.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_118.wav|21|That is the position the MoD has adopted.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_016.wav|32|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. )
DUMMY2/p268/p268_065.wav|87|He will need that machine.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_061.wav|33|We are not the first to be affected.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_102.wav|71|"He takes the job."
DUMMY2/p246/p246_322.wav|5|Off with their heads.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_112.wav|99|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_003.wav|5|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_158.wav|12|Sussex Police refused to give any further details.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_097.wav|88|He felt there was no case to answer.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_327.wav|58|We could not have asked for any more.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_294.wav|92|You're going to die.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_047.wav|58|You see, it wasn't a tournament of equals.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_418.wav|46|I grew up listening to these people.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_191.wav|37|There is no evidence that these people are helpful.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_325.wav|79|There they were, making excuses for him.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_248.wav|94|Some families have even requested to leave the city.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_175.wav|25|But the petrol station does not get the benefit.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_242.wav|36|After that nothing could save him.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_254.wav|33|I want to create events.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_105.wav|0|She's got to say something.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_365.wav|14|It has to solve the nuclear waste disposal problem.)
DUMMY2/p279/p279_086.wav|25|It is a time bomb.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_055.wav|102|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_348.wav|101|Does it matter ?
DUMMY2/p265/p265_298.wav|73|Is there on his hands?
DUMMY2/p270/p270_400.wav|8|The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_211.wav|105|We have got to get it right.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_375.wav|8|Lord Macdonald has worked on this deal for three months.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_033.wav|3|This is a central issue.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_112.wav|74|Are there any he wants to play?
DUMMY2/p267/p267_145.wav|0|We will turn the corner.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_133.wav|9|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_352.wav|16|They should take their mobile phones.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_332.wav|18|Well, that was the plan.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_325.wav|25|She did not attend the courtroom.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_411.wav|24|We're not taking any risks.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_086.wav|58|Debate was impassioned and furious.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_230.wav|55|The idea is simple.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_136.wav|5|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_211.wav|25|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_331.wav|6|I think they are right to be impatient.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_015.wav|17|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_259.wav|21|I'm not going to change from it.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_009.wav|40|There is , according to the legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_001.wav|39|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_414.wav|15|We actually had a laugh about that.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_031.wav|76|I thought it was quite good.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_047.wav|41|I am just going to go for it.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_306.wav|40|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_118.wav|5|There were no grounds for his action.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_048.wav|90|It's a crucial award.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_390.wav|39|I felt the head was very like me.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_044.wav|44|I will not be in dialogue with her.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_255.wav|96|It's a record label, not a form of music.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_207.wav|92|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_204.wav|79|I am prepared to step down.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_287.wav|61|We're in shock.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_298.wav|107|It all seemed so easy.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_147.wav|76|We haven't found out anything different.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_150.wav|73|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_289.wav|75|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_182.wav|17|I'm not a magician.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_230.wav|105|The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_039.wav|3|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_190.wav|55|He is particularly happy with the size of the gallery.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_090.wav|99|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_137.wav|76|This performance has given my confidence a boost.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_006.wav|48|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_370.wav|52|I have come here to show support for the families.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_068.wav|94|You need a trademark.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_333.wav|63|Much the same thing happens in a young company.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_041.wav|50|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_215.wav|62|The dangers are very obvious.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_405.wav|60|It was all too little, too late.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_036.wav|72|The most important thing was to win today.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_335.wav|101|We are in the end game.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_342.wav|49|He takes his time, and won't be rushed.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_013.wav|17|Some have accepted it as a miracle without any physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_040.wav|35|Well, he is an artist.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_043.wav|73|She looked so young.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_300.wav|90|One was a lawyer.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_071.wav|18|It is extremely fortunate.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_309.wav|13|It's only tackling congestion.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_202.wav|27|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_039.wav|106|Further management changes are planned.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_237.wav|57|The perception is that we do not care about social issues.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_343.wav|43|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_171.wav|33|I'm really happy with how things went there.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_370.wav|57|It's a record label, not a form of music.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_322.wav|6|You have no chance of planning permission.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_231.wav|53|I felt we played some excellent football in the first half.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_093.wav|93|We could not get any possession.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_009.wav|39|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_272.wav|90|It was an easy decision to come here.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_180.wav|48|Does that put pressure on us ?
DUMMY2/p329/p329_014.wav|103|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_095.wav|104|Was it a signal?
DUMMY2/p279/p279_390.wav|25|However, BBC Scotland was not interested in his work.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_335.wav|20|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_085.wav|107|Not everyone, however, was pleased with the proposed changes.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_136.wav|60|It is a fantasy.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_009.wav|29|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_365.wav|20|He was also a great man.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_131.wav|50|They made such decisions in London.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_255.wav|95|This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_130.wav|76|We need to make more inquiries about that.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_143.wav|91|All things are possible if you believe.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_251.wav|92|It is like a theatre of the absurd.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_112.wav|72|We are about to have our own Parliament.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_155.wav|36|And does it ?
DUMMY2/p225/p225_003.wav|101|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_021.wav|9|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_154.wav|47|I was in the train station overnight.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_287.wav|10|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_163.wav|62|I'm not sure.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_137.wav|6|She didn't tell me anything the night before.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_077.wav|88|Who is he?
DUMMY2/p317/p317_350.wav|97|This comes down to a problem of arrogance.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_056.wav|58|I think it is a sensible change.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_120.wav|47|I'm so angry.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_059.wav|24|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_089.wav|46|Theatre is not a museum.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_070.wav|54|However, consumers may take a different view.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_063.wav|100|Only water is currently allowed.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_053.wav|84|Yesterday, he was busy in his office.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_266.wav|69|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_134.wav|24|It isn't a happy memory.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_026.wav|82|I want to go home.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_020.wav|70|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_296.wav|44|Last night, however, other experts were cautious about the claim.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_086.wav|74|I've thought a lot about the Commonwealths.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_010.wav|24|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_164.wav|30|But they will not be compelled to join.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_281.wav|5|It's so awful.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_336.wav|37|Thereafter they were allowed to proceed.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_009.wav|0|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_017.wav|81|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_149.wav|23|We had to take action to protect them.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_301.wav|9|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_092.wav|21|He's got the same story.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_121.wav|38|It's not one for the purist.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_014.wav|76|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_208.wav|43|I don't want to use it.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_321.wav|94|SCOTLAND has shown the way.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_340.wav|75|Even the one she loved.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_211.wav|35|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_171.wav|81|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_330.wav|62|She is a great talent.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_161.wav|72|I have worked with him on projects.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_227.wav|33|That, though, was then.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_296.wav|103|That would have been too easy.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_330.wav|23|He's very young but he is growing up.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_294.wav|52|The agreement remains the only show in town.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_164.wav|51|The elections should have no role in this.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_262.wav|52|There would be a north and south division.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_142.wav|107|It will be the final push.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_267.wav|89|It was very fast.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_140.wav|59|The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_166.wav|49|This will secure the future of our industry.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_239.wav|69|I should think so, too.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_017.wav|105|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_182.wav|92|That's when you hope to take advantage.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_117.wav|94|Every woman deserves to live without this type of fear.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_067.wav|28|There is a tunnel after the tunnel.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_007.wav|70|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_416.wav|27|Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_242.wav|66|I think he has undergone a sea change.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_061.wav|57|Four other charges were dropped.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_049.wav|6|I was not overly concerned about this.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_314.wav|67|It's certainly different.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_301.wav|6|It is a terrible state of affairs.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_343.wav|60|That must have had an effect.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_133.wav|75|She died at her home.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_224.wav|75|Which isn't a bad idea.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_167.wav|89|It is not like us.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_192.wav|64|I have been very nervous.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_085.wav|54|The jury is still out.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_403.wav|1|They had given up on him.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_125.wav|14|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.)
DUMMY2/p270/p270_040.wav|8|The boy is no longer with us.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_194.wav|54|Mind you, he hasn't been back for ages.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_362.wav|104|Europe is a bonus.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_219.wav|97|Thus far we have received no complaints.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_034.wav|61|I think a move would create a lot of interest.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_383.wav|96|Talks are progressing.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_001.wav|43|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_372.wav|93|A deadline is still essential.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_027.wav|5|Is this accurate?
DUMMY2/p232/p232_277.wav|96|She has every confidence in his performance of his duties.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_331.wav|44|Just see where the blood is coming from.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_332.wav|39|It is a court case.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_349.wav|35|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_071.wav|83|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
DUMMY2/p363/p363_086.wav|6|That is my preference.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_205.wav|36|It was a test in itself.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_075.wav|72|I will wait until later.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_082.wav|12|It is truly fields of miracles.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_290.wav|97|They are in care for a reason.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_314.wav|6|I'm a bit overwhelmed.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_289.wav|77|She failed in her action.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_383.wav|104|Are there muscular problems?
DUMMY2/p280/p280_202.wav|52|I've never had a year like this.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_370.wav|91|Mr Straw was home secretary at the time.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_085.wav|95|The result is a vacuum.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_078.wav|23|I can live with just the one.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_121.wav|85|It's very ingenious.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_378.wav|8|She said they would appeal.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_050.wav|80|He looks like an Afghan.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_113.wav|47|It is rubbish.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_264.wav|84|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_123.wav|26|She does not want to speak.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_366.wav|104|And it had two seats.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_369.wav|102|I am really looking forward to it.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_222.wav|91|This makes no sense!
DUMMY2/p246/p246_157.wav|5|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_219.wav|74|Everyone here is heartbroken.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_370.wav|86|Safety was also an issue.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_160.wav|84|I was so nervous.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_130.wav|60|I hope it has helped the prisoners.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_037.wav|49|There were no proposals on the table.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_227.wav|26|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_230.wav|34|I am sure all schools would accept that.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_351.wav|103|It was quite rigorous.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_373.wav|33|The cause is just.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_248.wav|50|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_414.wav|11|So what was he really doing?
DUMMY2/p362/p362_077.wav|15|That is her job.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_351.wav|84|He agreed with my proposal.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_328.wav|87|It particularly increases under-age drinking, he claimed.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_315.wav|22|We are ready for the long haul.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_126.wav|78|I am delighted to have been the captain of the winning side.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_315.wav|10|You have to see it like this.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_154.wav|50|A new school will be built.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_294.wav|0|I felt like I was a child.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_075.wav|55|Their time has gone.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_241.wav|29|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_066.wav|75|Both men were on one-year contracts.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_176.wav|7|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.)
DUMMY2/p228/p228_063.wav|57|There was a battle there.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_363.wav|48|The actual increases will be announced next month.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_345.wav|24|The Premier League has been a huge success.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_288.wav|87|Are they free ?
DUMMY2/p250/p250_020.wav|24|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_026.wav|32|She is employed on short-term contracts.)
DUMMY2/p275/p275_224.wav|40|It's the Tate.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_164.wav|22|I thought it was a fantastic game.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_197.wav|105|It's just awful.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_317.wav|101|At the moment, it is very difficult to know.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_083.wav|87|He admitted afterwards that he didn't know much about it.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_093.wav|23|The lowest increase was recorded in Dundee.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_323.wav|59|I saw some good things.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_084.wav|44|Audacious decisions were taken early on.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_241.wav|89|The concerns are the same.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_082.wav|46|That is in the public domain.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_042.wav|71|"A neighbour said."
DUMMY2/p232/p232_039.wav|96|I was scared.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_085.wav|75|Change will however have to be in euros.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_082.wav|31|We want to know about the policy.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_156.wav|106|Token gestures of tiny tax cuts will not do.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_372.wav|92|He had been surprised by the local reaction.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_206.wav|39|Two years later, she was dead.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_033.wav|24|He works at the airport.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_092.wav|82|They don't work anymore anyway.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_192.wav|73|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_285.wav|34|We also have to work the dark side, if you will.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_291.wav|27|She is an expert on medical ethics.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_108.wav|2|Is that right?
DUMMY2/p307/p307_344.wav|22|We were lucky to have survived.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_119.wav|27|You had better believe it.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_374.wav|55|These matters can't just be medical decisions.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_211.wav|42|That's hard for a woman.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_109.wav|74|Another man said, It was horrible.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_328.wav|25|Was this element always there?
DUMMY2/p275/p275_070.wav|40|It's all I can do.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_277.wav|101|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_010.wav|53|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_011.wav|98|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_268.wav|54|It's an internal matter.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_100.wav|90|There was no rescue.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_365.wav|74|We wanted to do something different.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_033.wav|56|That is the face of fear.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_166.wav|57|It was so new, so exciting.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_329.wav|69|The package was expected to be launched within the next three months.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_210.wav|78|As many as the market will support.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_442.wav|75|Nine days later, he suffered another attack.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_284.wav|30|Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_380.wav|35|Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_296.wav|62|I was first in the door.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_245.wav|37|I was a lucky man tonight.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_370.wav|41|Talks are progressing.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_285.wav|52|There was just fire all around me.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_322.wav|63|I must do something about it.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_324.wav|63|Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_352.wav|78|He has been told by the doctor to rest.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_109.wav|24|The vast bulk of its funds are run by Aberdeen.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_247.wav|48|I've learned from my mistakes.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_394.wav|53|In my opinion, any transfer to a foreign club will help him progress.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_086.wav|14|It makes for an interesting conference.)
DUMMY2/p236/p236_166.wav|75|He is not a team captain.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_209.wav|35|The research is published in the journal, Nature.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_160.wav|16|It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_183.wav|26|He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_390.wav|63|Rugby has an extended run.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_279.wav|85|The deadline is real and absolute.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_067.wav|102|If convicted, they face the death penalty.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_162.wav|60|I don't know how they do it.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_242.wav|34|I went home and wrote about it.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_368.wav|62|Soon the whole country will be level.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_170.wav|45|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_190.wav|22|Morale is very high, despite the growing risks.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_348.wav|85|Chelsea was a great club.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_360.wav|37|I saw them last week.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_217.wav|94|It had all been arranged.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_203.wav|77|how do you get it back ?
DUMMY2/p302/p302_106.wav|30|But the attachment took a lot of growing.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_336.wav|53|I hope numbers will be up on last time.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_132.wav|39|I told him I was a long time ago.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_159.wav|73|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_123.wav|9|I'm so angry.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_239.wav|13|That was six years ago.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_270.wav|33|He has a wealth of experience.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_250.wav|94|It's a record label, not a form of music.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_009.wav|26|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_346.wav|74|You know the score.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_087.wav|91|It has never been worthwhile.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_340.wav|39|She is on a life support machine.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_096.wav|69|They lived for their children.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_166.wav|28|There is no internal damage.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_352.wav|13|There are moments of silence.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_372.wav|23|His arguments were supported by Mr Bevan.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_337.wav|75|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_169.wav|67|Was this element always there ?
DUMMY2/p258/p258_147.wav|26|She had gone to the Catholic school.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_098.wav|10|Why do it otherwise ?
DUMMY2/p254/p254_005.wav|41|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_172.wav|87|Do I think about them often ?
DUMMY2/p262/p262_316.wav|45|Is there on his hands?
DUMMY2/p236/p236_449.wav|75|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_002.wav|97|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_141.wav|6|Hard it will be.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_215.wav|54|Every game against New Zealand is.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_208.wav|70|Twaddle is a case in point.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_174.wav|53|The company hopes to top seven million passengers in its current financial year.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_252.wav|40|Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_014.wav|73|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_259.wav|39|We have a free vote on these things in our party.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_145.wav|68|But, clearly, it is crucial to understand that point.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_290.wav|47|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_278.wav|5|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_266.wav|44|There is no such thing.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_204.wav|42|I have played well the past two days.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_312.wav|19|I am not a paedophile.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_047.wav|12|But the law is very clear on this.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_311.wav|66|We have lost the round, but not the fight.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_154.wav|36|So what is the campaign about ?
DUMMY2/p311/p311_121.wav|4|Someone else has now got them.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_296.wav|18|I have nothing to say on that.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_195.wav|30|Public confidence was undermined by that terrible tragedy.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_274.wav|4|It doesn't seem like that long ago.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_235.wav|7|It had all been arranged.)
DUMMY2/p250/p250_036.wav|24|It was just appalling luck.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_324.wav|59|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_410.wav|66|The euro is your money, it is our money.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_406.wav|10|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_129.wav|3|Three days later, he was killed.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_081.wav|76|Who wants to be a millionaire?
DUMMY2/p253/p253_126.wav|70|I'm so angry.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_257.wav|25|This is a big club.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_024.wav|78|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_096.wav|58|We are trying to establish a date.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_055.wav|89|He is too weak to move.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_033.wav|21|Nor is it likely to do so.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_271.wav|87|A more exhaustive analysis is in progress.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_350.wav|98|Bomber was not amused.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_296.wav|27|No Briton has ever won.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_286.wav|51|Some may end up in hospital.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_050.wav|15|But this was refused.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_420.wav|0|I've got my own ideas.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_011.wav|26|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_326.wav|0|The deal was presented yesterday as a merger.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_030.wav|1|It was nothing to do with my daughter.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_274.wav|29|The capital costs are modest.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_080.wav|9|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_289.wav|23|They have got their position, we have got our position.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_010.wav|79|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_064.wav|69|That's the truth.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_312.wav|0|There were no passengers on board.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_032.wav|36|Our fans have been marvellous.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_157.wav|63|It opens the door to the Champions League.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_030.wav|78|However, the following year the cancer returned.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_370.wav|104|But who was driving it?
DUMMY2/p245/p245_109.wav|59|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_257.wav|45|We run within the law.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_111.wav|36|They are at a very early stage.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_044.wav|65|It does not stop here.)
DUMMY2/p300/p300_373.wav|102|I will never get over his death.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_167.wav|1|I was proud of our lads.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_398.wav|53|People have a wish to charge twice.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_376.wav|49|The wealth of talent in Australia is awesome.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_217.wav|21|This was not a summit about the euro.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_293.wav|29|He ran into immediate problems with local people and police.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_250.wav|33|They seem to turn up for them.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_122.wav|70|We enjoyed it today.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_036.wav|73|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_056.wav|34|They may have been murdered.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_398.wav|79|I am delighted to have her back home.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_349.wav|25|I kept going for her.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_207.wav|78|He played it like a veteran.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_076.wav|56|He has been a success this year.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_087.wav|85|He was caught and fired.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_047.wav|21|That's what we're trying to achieve.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_321.wav|56|We will listen to any suggestion.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_232.wav|95|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_405.wav|91|Whether this return was too soon.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_296.wav|12|After that he became more romantic.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_125.wav|46|Both these events occurred on Wednesday night.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_418.wav|17|He came close to signing for Rangers, too.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_383.wav|47|It is an interesting title, Believing in Britain.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_357.wav|6|Obviously we want to stop the rot.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_057.wav|85|There was only silence.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_093.wav|14|On Saturday, it was much the same.)
DUMMY2/p374/p374_019.wav|11|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_093.wav|11|It doesn't always work that way.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_181.wav|51|Wednesday's decision came as a surprise.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_039.wav|71|"They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life."
DUMMY2/p312/p312_371.wav|62|Attack appears to be the biggest concern.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_231.wav|64|It's because they can't understand the language.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_388.wav|55|It's an option, but I can't really comment.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_043.wav|8|Must be prepared to use it.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_194.wav|75|I had too much to drink.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_337.wav|54|That's what it's all about, isn't it?
DUMMY2/p252/p252_325.wav|55|Murray plays down return
DUMMY2/p303/p303_118.wav|44|We are losing this war.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_338.wav|13|They are with their father.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_166.wav|76|Obviously, a lot has changed for me since then.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_023.wav|25|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_031.wav|104|They were impressive against France.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_044.wav|18|Labour has been found out on public spending.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_194.wav|81|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_255.wav|83|They must play for each other.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_126.wav|36|Scottish Life was there over one year.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_353.wav|79|That there would be discussions.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_272.wav|32|This idea has been around for four years.)
DUMMY2/p230/p230_299.wav|35|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_417.wav|14|Shelter also supports the reform.)
DUMMY2/p314/p314_310.wav|51|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_365.wav|19|They took a risk.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_237.wav|95|We have an election in eight days.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_074.wav|86|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_479.wav|14|That was the first time I worked with Richard.)
DUMMY2/p333/p333_142.wav|64|However, it's good to turn the page.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_016.wav|38|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_270.wav|55|It is also hoped big name stars could be brought on board.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_152.wav|22|He is wanted by German police for questioning.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_243.wav|81|I should think so, too.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_369.wav|97|The actors just have to say so.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_034.wav|82|We had to laugh.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_004.wav|20|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_360.wav|105|I haven't had a kick at a Celtic player for a while.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_138.wav|55|No contact was made, although the arm was clearly raised.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_376.wav|70|Since then, he has played no active part in the company.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_125.wav|4|I let go the telephone and ran.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_005.wav|83|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_413.wav|24|I had a fortunate war.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_124.wav|56|That is the ultimate revenge.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_218.wav|15|Gas is too expensive.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_379.wav|76|I enjoy the creative process.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_195.wav|94|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
