DUMMY2/p236/p236_134.wav|75|I have a kind of love affair with Hollywood.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_045.wav|99|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_039.wav|72|The butcher is very good.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_320.wav|73|I'm very lucky.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_087.wav|71|"She told The Herald."
DUMMY2/p227/p227_353.wav|29|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_361.wav|6|It raises a serious question mark.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_212.wav|54|You may have a short memory.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_050.wav|8|He also presented You Bet!
DUMMY2/p281/p281_180.wav|36|It is not either national standards or local control.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_055.wav|78|Yesterday, he was busy in his office.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_366.wav|19|The idea was presented to me.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_329.wav|70|Two people were interviewed.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_310.wav|87|You were an easy target and therefore an easy sacrifice.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_067.wav|65|Things have just worked out this way.)
DUMMY2/p283/p283_468.wav|95|We are going through the process.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_078.wav|103|This avalanche is just beginning.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_323.wav|53|We still think this trade is on the increase.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_188.wav|38|No finals are to be contested today.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_043.wav|103|That argument has been won.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_233.wav|87|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_324.wav|55|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_338.wav|74|Let's not take too much for granted.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_047.wav|95|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_043.wav|52|He too started on the subs seats.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_223.wav|28|She did not attend the courtroom.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_047.wav|84|It depends on the decisions of the member states.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_271.wav|5|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_407.wav|100|He put some colour into Scottish history.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_366.wav|56|We are really good friends.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_030.wav|42|Tommy is not a problem.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_084.wav|24|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_150.wav|30|Debbie Harry was cool.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_311.wav|102|An aide was constructed to get a copy.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_030.wav|96|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_460.wav|36|It must never be seen as second class.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_317.wav|24|He will address the nation this evening.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_314.wav|23|It is also claimed that he was murdered.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_142.wav|46|I felt we needed to bring that in.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_296.wav|25|Sunday's game was not a trial.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_102.wav|70|They make a selective perception process.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_293.wav|96|The Government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_387.wav|16|That's the name of the game, though.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_265.wav|35|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_252.wav|9|We have a free vote on these things in our party.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_203.wav|21|Entries from the event are still being accepted.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_387.wav|15|Yes, it took time to recover.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_188.wav|17|They had previously been on five-day notice.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_136.wav|7|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.)
DUMMY2/p298/p298_351.wav|68|An internal inquiry was launched into the procedures.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_403.wav|76|It would have been very easily done.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_310.wav|45|It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_248.wav|32|Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter.)
DUMMY2/p264/p264_432.wav|65|The tie isn't over.)
DUMMY2/p294/p294_377.wav|104|Certainly, there is much on the agenda.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_296.wav|99|We believe the world has too many refugees already.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_160.wav|78|We want to get there.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_287.wav|26|The death toll included five children.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_143.wav|72|I feel very sad and extremely cut up.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_404.wav|19|I will never manage another Scottish club.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_183.wav|67|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_213.wav|78|The report was welcomed by the Law Society of Scotland.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_005.wav|36|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_059.wav|10|The baby was later transferred to a hospital in Glasgow.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_305.wav|55|His career may also provide food for thought for Ferguson.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_393.wav|106|It didn't matter who was in their way.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_394.wav|18|There is no other option.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_033.wav|23|Several others were absent.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_011.wav|28|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_282.wav|29|It does not work that way in Scottish football.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_230.wav|81|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_032.wav|92|Thankfully, that doesn't happen that often.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_291.wav|62|A kinder but effective treatment would be welcomed.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_170.wav|5|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_040.wav|26|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_215.wav|15|We are not a retailer, we provide a service.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_447.wav|8|It was to be inclusive.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_273.wav|17|And yet his legacy is doubtful.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_358.wav|89|It's now down in black and white.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_196.wav|33|Another one said the couple came from Inverness.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_118.wav|86|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_108.wav|47|The fire was above the hole.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_064.wav|104|It is all about having physical evidence.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_344.wav|80|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_159.wav|78|If not, a deal could take many months.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_412.wav|32|Thankfully, Peter had already found another outlet for his talents.)
DUMMY2/p238/p238_182.wav|37|The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_327.wav|27|There was no time scale.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_495.wav|48|The whole thing was just unreal.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_296.wav|47|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_071.wav|31|Ferguson should take note.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_255.wav|104|There are still some matters to be discussed.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_355.wav|25|He could make it.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_174.wav|81|I'm just going to hit the shot.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_249.wav|72|The band was good, and it's been a great day.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_393.wav|74|There's also the point.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_204.wav|53|As you see with the fuel duty business, they do.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_323.wav|72|I am totally surprised.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_302.wav|40|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_345.wav|80|Eight months later, he was dead.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_289.wav|81|No Briton has ever won.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_093.wav|105|He was possessed
DUMMY2/p341/p341_372.wav|66|Her advice for Glasgow is just be visionary.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_350.wav|47|That has been lost.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_010.wav|66|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_015.wav|25|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_345.wav|99|I kept going for her.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_023.wav|61|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_049.wav|27|They were on holiday in Egypt.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_366.wav|107|I grew up listening to these people.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_216.wav|104|We're very, very excited.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_304.wav|25|This is a war over our home.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_007.wav|26|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_298.wav|10|Scottish rugby has given me everything.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_393.wav|94|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_082.wav|28|No, we had nothing to do with the Jews.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_383.wav|27|Yet the data is compelling.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_094.wav|43|Every time I play I do not understand their reaction.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_240.wav|31|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_165.wav|76|Golf is a game of honour and ethics.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_123.wav|78|The announcement of a preferred bidder is expected at the same time.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_069.wav|103|What happens when the funding is exhausted.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_298.wav|50|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_281.wav|43|It happens from time to time.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_373.wav|94|All the investment is possible through the public sector.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_392.wav|69|I love the thought of having a crack at defending the title.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_403.wav|89|Then , he laughs.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_107.wav|43|It was a good performance.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_361.wav|64|His silence on the issue is interesting.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_211.wav|2|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_328.wav|78|Another difference is the cost.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_269.wav|6|She is under police escort.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_098.wav|97|Too much has already been said.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_220.wav|87|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_090.wav|92|It didn't come as any great surprise.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_302.wav|10|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_281.wav|60|A press conference is about politics.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_205.wav|42|He has not created a Festival resource.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_079.wav|22|Without approval, the sport will find it difficult to develop.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_130.wav|31|My main concern is that public health is not put at risk.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_065.wav|26|It's all I can do.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_357.wav|57|He later became a respected High Court judge.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_033.wav|43|From that day on we started to look for another full back.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_231.wav|79|This time, he will be more on the defensive.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_382.wav|7|He is an excellent manager.)
DUMMY2/p376/p376_012.wav|71|"Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. "
DUMMY2/p317/p317_412.wav|97|Then one night only three people turn up.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_188.wav|75|We are the gateway to justice.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_150.wav|10|I prefer the clarity of the existing system.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_341.wav|14|Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.)
DUMMY2/p257/p257_117.wav|105|It's not a new concept in jazz.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_189.wav|3|It is simply not true.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_066.wav|25|That's the truth.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_371.wav|69|I am a wealthy person.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_026.wav|24|Meetings will also remain private.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_182.wav|23|Britain hasn't seen it in this way.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_422.wav|33|They have got off with murder.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_475.wav|75|I could feel the blood on my face.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_195.wav|78|What do we want to do that for ?
DUMMY2/p317/p317_343.wav|97|Iain Duncan Smith is wrong.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_280.wav|43|He has a wealth of experience.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_137.wav|30|We are very concerned about controller fatigue.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_150.wav|60|We've had an enjoyable adventure.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_065.wav|16|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_409.wav|4|I was furious about it.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_196.wav|39|Equally, he is grateful to have survived the cull.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_223.wav|60|We are not conducting the review.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_181.wav|34|This is a mental challenge.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_270.wav|91|It is believed she had serious head injuries.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_049.wav|2|I was lost.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_038.wav|81|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_490.wav|24|I cannot explain the grief and pain in my heart.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_393.wav|92|However, the referee was not in the giving vein.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_073.wav|60|The bombing begins in five minutes.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_054.wav|98|I'm going to buy a car.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_010.wav|51|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_062.wav|6|He did that last Sunday.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_060.wav|70|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_196.wav|27|However, he had not yet been charged in connection with the robbery.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_073.wav|71|"Neither it is."
DUMMY2/p307/p307_382.wav|22|Filtering through this material a composite finale emerges.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_177.wav|23|It's been such a long haul.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_280.wav|83|Dialogue is the key.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_061.wav|83|It is unique.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_173.wav|43|His team management was protective.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_391.wav|104|Calvin was back at his best today.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_043.wav|28|I read about it in the newspapers.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_204.wav|84|It wasn't to be.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_285.wav|72|I haven't had a lesson in four years.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_209.wav|9|Today was first class.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_256.wav|37|This wasn't just a big crowd.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_148.wav|73|I will tell you.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_094.wav|25|Yet, it worked.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_131.wav|28|They failed in their duty to Mr Logan.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_391.wav|21|They are there to help us.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_411.wav|19|The next eight weeks are critical to us.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_065.wav|89|They are ready.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_332.wav|10|Much the same thing happens in a young company.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_247.wav|102|The performance, for this listener, didn't come off.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_267.wav|19|So, it took me back to boarding school.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_046.wav|2|He looks like an Afghan.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_022.wav|71|"The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. "
DUMMY2/p339/p339_351.wav|18|That will depend on the outcome of inquiries.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_372.wav|78|The news is not all bad.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_303.wav|25|They are wrong.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_325.wav|38|It was a UK-wide report.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_275.wav|2|The election is total confusion and chaos.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_128.wav|48|How independent is that ?
DUMMY2/p297/p297_301.wav|42|Almost overnight, he found his voice.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_114.wav|64|The days of empty promises are over.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_419.wav|6|This is actually true.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_234.wav|89|It is hard won.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_064.wav|18|The police are not the target.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_057.wav|74|It needs a rethink.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_085.wav|16|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_036.wav|37|Let there be no doubt about that.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_181.wav|102|This was extremely foolish behaviour on your part.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_091.wav|7|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?)
DUMMY2/p343/p343_192.wav|21|It has been a magical moment.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_331.wav|0|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_224.wav|33|It may not even be possible.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_046.wav|105|It's a blessing.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_353.wav|52|The executive has so far not offered any immediate prospect of major change.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_139.wav|16|I was awful.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_398.wav|92|It was very lucky no-one was killed.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_098.wav|47|I didn't play well last year.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_316.wav|19|But then they scored their fourth.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_203.wav|12|It's hard, but if we don't do it, nobody will.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_116.wav|106|I've had it for the exams.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_204.wav|17|What is the truth about the cow?
DUMMY2/p363/p363_233.wav|6|All were later allowed home.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_098.wav|61|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_351.wav|86|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_207.wav|18|It is not a road of life.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_073.wav|58|It probably didn't feel anything, she added.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_126.wav|57|Who would be a referee ?
DUMMY2/p376/p376_231.wav|71|"Sadly, it sounds as if it is."
DUMMY2/p240/p240_039.wav|93|They're just different.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_102.wav|86|Tomorrow he will make a keynote speech on Europe.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_275.wav|8|And they were being paid ?
DUMMY2/p263/p263_120.wav|39|The fire was above the hole.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_105.wav|104|Sacking John Redwood is a disaster.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_387.wav|11|I'm trying to stay open on that.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_027.wav|15|Yesterday's performance was exactly that.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_323.wav|97|We are expected to do better than before.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_330.wav|37|It particularly increases under-age drinking, he claimed.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_315.wav|33|For his opposite number, this was a just triumph.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_180.wav|68|Mistakes are being made on an increasing basis.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_352.wav|24|The pain is still acute.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_354.wav|45|The parents are not alone in their concerns about the proposals.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_030.wav|58|I was left-handed, but it was just a matter of practice.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_298.wav|87|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_352.wav|14|There was some merit in that.)
DUMMY2/p252/p252_213.wav|55|Business will continue as usual.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_258.wav|32|Kingfisher can afford to wait.)
DUMMY2/p266/p266_107.wav|20|Now, though, he believes that the new formation has helped his form.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_397.wav|7|We are really good friends.)
DUMMY2/p241/p241_094.wav|86|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_108.wav|76|I think the Scottish bid is very strong.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_209.wav|88|This is perfectly legal.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_335.wav|99|The composer will conduct.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_341.wav|61|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_426.wav|100|It was important to win the singles.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_331.wav|98|That's not part of the deal.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_369.wav|83|Colour was at the core of his life.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_356.wav|84|Also, it is the season of goodwill.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_108.wav|107|Two and a half million people have died.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_375.wav|24|We are really good friends.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_122.wav|9|She has been shot.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_308.wav|45|They should be swept away.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_351.wav|57|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_019.wav|61|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_361.wav|34|Last year, it was ligaments in his knee.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_316.wav|4|This is not out of choice.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_054.wav|65|All options are available.)
DUMMY2/p340/p340_043.wav|74|We can hardly talk about it.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_117.wav|59|Wish I could be there on Sunday in person but I can't.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_344.wav|41|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_167.wav|34|Nato has left them with no other option.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_288.wav|10|It all started with a visiting rugby club.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_271.wav|28|Maybe it helps us.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_090.wav|51|He has changed my life for ever.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_297.wav|65|Autumn will be a real challenge.)
DUMMY2/p259/p259_050.wav|7|Pulled a huge number of viewers.)
DUMMY2/p225/p225_044.wav|101|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_291.wav|69|I was brought up in a mining background.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_008.wav|90|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_071.wav|42|They can be time consuming.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_247.wav|55|It was a great evening.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_274.wav|82|And they still have the final to come.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_207.wav|106|That is an entirely unacceptable position.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_134.wav|7|It could be done by experts and lawyers.)
DUMMY2/p249/p249_005.wav|80|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_231.wav|58|It was a big day.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_240.wav|73|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_267.wav|58|We knew nothing about it.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_045.wav|45|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_316.wav|84|My body is clearly capable.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_170.wav|14|Nothing was meant by it.)
DUMMY2/p362/p362_062.wav|15|I feel my parents are in New York.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_114.wav|73|Holland won by five wickets.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_046.wav|9|That should do it.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_104.wav|57|He is hungry for success and I am the same.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_263.wav|47|It looks as though he will be right.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_299.wav|89|You are the glory.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_192.wav|90|I am totally surprised.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_297.wav|22|They are the innocent victims.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_135.wav|30|The European Court is our only option.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_157.wav|7|No-one from the Fire Brigades Union was available for comment yesterday.)
DUMMY2/p239/p239_109.wav|48|People will have to be patient.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_057.wav|19|We might be back next year.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_257.wav|38|They are there to get people into work.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_147.wav|84|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_269.wav|57|He's been here on numerous occasions.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_327.wav|33|Our approach will be different.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_301.wav|26|Nothing is safe.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_080.wav|34|Who will run the bigger show?
DUMMY2/p251/p251_078.wav|9|I was too young.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_372.wav|37|But the rally was short-lived.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_141.wav|67|Government will intervene.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_394.wav|28|However, his remarks were heavily qualified.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_420.wav|106|I have received no explanation.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_237.wav|41|It's a lovely, lovely film.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_199.wav|83|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_305.wav|77|The answer is with ourselves.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_358.wav|33|It can be frightening.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_349.wav|16|Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_050.wav|69|This represents a tough game for us.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_129.wav|56|I'm so grateful for that.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_123.wav|34|Such adjustments have been the salvation of United.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_215.wav|77|His second was a beauty.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_409.wav|46|We can't win a big game.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_058.wav|87|It was just too much for us.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_050.wav|96|They had to explain it.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_107.wav|18|It was a bit of a tightrope.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_283.wav|92|We still have a long, long way to go.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_001.wav|19|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_137.wav|102|One of them, a woman, is in serious condition.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_305.wav|49|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_228.wav|84|Mental health is a massive issue.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_337.wav|23|A whole range of factors are involved.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_100.wav|59|I was angry.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_364.wav|9|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_362.wav|25|So there, we won.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_057.wav|50|Four other charges were dropped.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_043.wav|61|That is a break with tradition.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_095.wav|55|It looks that way.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_461.wav|7|It certainly appeared that way.)
DUMMY2/p323/p323_086.wav|34|It's an interesting debate to get going.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_126.wav|64|This is our way to make our point.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_201.wav|11|This hasn't happened in a vacuum.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_029.wav|3|However, the following year the cancer returned.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_127.wav|87|The Breadwinner came home from Africa.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_371.wav|51|Alcohol and nicotine are now no-go areas.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_080.wav|75|They lived for their children.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_202.wav|89|The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_182.wav|4|It was entirely justified.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_380.wav|18|We have chosen for the patients.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_018.wav|70|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_245.wav|41|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_050.wav|76|My brother's buried under there.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_014.wav|18|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_150.wav|82|See the amazing arrogance of this, they say.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_316.wav|2|It will work.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_263.wav|25|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_330.wav|10|The party lasted all night.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_264.wav|57|That decision is for the British Parliament and people.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_394.wav|76|You can't go back and change things.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_322.wav|8|Why change it ?
DUMMY2/p237/p237_176.wav|61|Does that put pressure on us ?
DUMMY2/p283/p283_154.wav|95|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_203.wav|57|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_379.wav|45|I was so nervous.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_183.wav|20|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_238.wav|55|The full Cabinet will meet today to discuss the oil crisis.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_238.wav|18|We act because we must.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_251.wav|5|I can't get a job.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_106.wav|25|I didn't play well last year.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_297.wav|45|And huge, indeed, it is.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_282.wav|71|"Police were called to the ground and interviewed a number of people."
DUMMY2/p314/p314_058.wav|51|But he just carried on anyway.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_197.wav|44|They were very, very anxious and nervous about their personal safety.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_047.wav|74|I felt under a lot of pressure.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_297.wav|51|Glasgow deserved their win, but we made them look good.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_298.wav|15|Without approval, the sport will find it difficult to develop.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_217.wav|30|It used to bother me sometimes, but it doesn't any more.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_087.wav|17|I believe we have a good chance.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_181.wav|13|But there was no going back.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_079.wav|92|It has to find out what went wrong.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_331.wav|48|It is a triumphant performance, which defies the years.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_025.wav|51|The Scots are, however, in good company.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_343.wav|32|After some discussion they did.)
DUMMY2/p271/p271_212.wav|27|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_256.wav|56|We accept the new rules.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_244.wav|4|However, that is a sizeable if.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_003.wav|32|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  )
DUMMY2/p262/p262_293.wav|45|It's a lovely, lovely film.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_163.wav|28|It's always a rehearsal.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_148.wav|82|His words were not audible.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_252.wav|48|The strong performance is expected to continue.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_018.wav|42|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_335.wav|96|She did not attend the courtroom.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_217.wav|74|How can this be?
DUMMY2/p237/p237_170.wav|61|It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_125.wav|50|That period was a struggle.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_160.wav|35|And does it ?
DUMMY2/p278/p278_051.wav|10|I had trouble with the producers.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_188.wav|35|He lives in a neighbouring village.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_191.wav|60|O Neill has delivered.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_303.wav|65|It was finally agreed on Saturday.)
DUMMY2/p335/p335_078.wav|49|History is usually written by the victors.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_238.wav|4|Clearly he is keeping in touch.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_092.wav|2|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_302.wav|49|This will help our confidence.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_320.wav|21|Green is desperate to play on The Open.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_316.wav|58|Instead, she just went away.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_049.wav|36|However, he will now have to wait for his chance to impress.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_413.wav|16|Feel the air, the space.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_137.wav|89|Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_084.wav|56|He had missed a penalty against the English.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_352.wav|18|My mind is the most important thing now.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_150.wav|5|I was stunned.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_021.wav|24|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_246.wav|6|Sub Not Used, MacKay.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_119.wav|20|In the current outbreak, the reverse is true.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_079.wav|10|Mr Smith declined to comment.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_290.wav|90|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_428.wav|24|There is a solution, she believes.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_202.wav|11|I foolishly had done nothing about it.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_229.wav|103|It's a difficult job.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_025.wav|32|I can't play the game for them.)
DUMMY2/p277/p277_264.wav|89|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_182.wav|76|From now on there is no hiding place.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_322.wav|83|The figures are bad, but not that bad.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_026.wav|3|But we will have to wait.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_380.wav|10|Is it worth it ?
DUMMY2/p228/p228_353.wav|57|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_085.wav|45|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_317.wav|89|Is there a new way forward?
DUMMY2/p363/p363_234.wav|6|I can do this on my own.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_200.wav|5|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_367.wav|67|The group is due to publish its report in the autumn.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_226.wav|64|I hope they understand that.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_287.wav|20|Tony Blair said as little.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_372.wav|52|He really played us into a corner.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_311.wav|49|Hitches can be expected.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_266.wav|87|We believe in the medium term.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_043.wav|17|That argument has been won.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_016.wav|68|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_219.wav|90|We've got the bronze.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_384.wav|72|I didn't know where they were.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_072.wav|65|Without doubt, the debate on education is welcome.)
DUMMY2/p363/p363_077.wav|6|He is slightly confused.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_223.wav|25|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_009.wav|91|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_211.wav|87|Bottling is now the core business.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_314.wav|83|It will work.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_341.wav|104|Anything can happen - at any moment.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_017.wav|58|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_399.wav|89|Is that possible?
DUMMY2/p227/p227_319.wav|29|We have a clean bill of health.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_210.wav|63|The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_357.wav|48|So what is the campaign about ?
DUMMY2/p303/p303_297.wav|44|That is a job for the Government.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_390.wav|47|It's like a basketball.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_096.wav|11|I'm working at the moment.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_289.wav|24|It is also very valuable.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_060.wav|11|That took a long time to happen.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_409.wav|39|The casualties were not named.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_339.wav|73|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_141.wav|41|Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_186.wav|63|Playing in Europe is the benchmark.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_354.wav|99|It was that bad, that low.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_359.wav|19|The hotel was huge.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_084.wav|107|I never won a penny throughout my career.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_089.wav|84|What do we do ?
DUMMY2/p334/p334_114.wav|38|Of course we make mistakes, but we don't make too many.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_260.wav|34|There is nothing sinister in it.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_137.wav|68|Otherwise it could have secured a cinema release.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_362.wav|17|The milk industry is in turmoil.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_049.wav|3|Part of the complex is historic.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_404.wav|36|However, he urged the trade to keep the faith.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_265.wav|53|His condition was described as serious last night.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_005.wav|9|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_252.wav|57|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_165.wav|62|He had played well in that central role.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_279.wav|5|It is so very obvious.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_137.wav|3|So what is the campaign about ?
DUMMY2/p299/p299_276.wav|58|The fans will support us.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_071.wav|57|The script was funny.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_190.wav|1|We're not an employment agency.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_344.wav|11|It was not being marketed properly.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_054.wav|49|The Yugoslav army will still be there.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_428.wav|14|A similar scheme is under way in central Scotland.)
DUMMY2/p336/p336_357.wav|98|Things don't look too good at the moment.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_337.wav|56|Whether this return was too soon.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_288.wav|9|Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_163.wav|23|Politics is a tough game.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_347.wav|101|Boy is the town a mess.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_120.wav|91|You do not change overnight.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_240.wav|99|My future is in the marathon.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_149.wav|25|You know the type.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_064.wav|57|Scotland had great assets.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_049.wav|88|But it didn't happen.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_054.wav|46|Alright, it was a defeat, but it felt like a victory.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_236.wav|71|"It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet."
DUMMY2/p374/p374_148.wav|11|There is something in this.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_255.wav|73|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_241.wav|49|The observer saw no evidence of fighting.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_356.wav|38|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_082.wav|95|We should keep this recent assault in perspective.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_164.wav|45|It is not too late to get on board.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_247.wav|62|And does it?
DUMMY2/p268/p268_205.wav|87|McCarthy said it would look at other means of tackling market abuse.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_293.wav|44|I felt under no pressure today.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_134.wav|104|I have had a wonderful career.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_402.wav|29|Persuaded to change his mind.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_383.wav|66|Chris Paterson is a class act.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_308.wav|77|I can hardly believe it.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_413.wav|36|He seems to be used to the attention.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_216.wav|99|I've got to hold my own hands up for this one.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_409.wav|13|It is good for Europe.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_175.wav|35|City sentiment is in his favour.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_356.wav|83|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_094.wav|69|It is a blow.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_233.wav|103|The boy is no longer with us.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_096.wav|42|However, their reaction could not have been more different.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_180.wav|24|It had so much to do with output.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_119.wav|43|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_115.wav|8|Its replacement was not used in the exercise.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_082.wav|47|Nothing is yet confirmed.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_081.wav|63|It's all going to clear the debt.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_151.wav|10|Nothing was meant by it.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_234.wav|56|The irony was not lost.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_192.wav|98|Don't hold your breath!
DUMMY2/p316/p316_104.wav|85|That got me out.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_004.wav|63|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_259.wav|41|It is also very valuable.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_276.wav|106|Did he trip ?
DUMMY2/p251/p251_039.wav|9|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_440.wav|8|The villagers were shot in the head at short range.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_096.wav|74|It is a matter of clarity.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_200.wav|8|He should emerge as the winner.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_282.wav|88|It would be dangerous to resign.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_253.wav|11|Which means it matters.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_223.wav|91|I go home only once.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_297.wav|66|But, mainly, it is up to ourselves.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_461.wav|50|They were good years for him.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_161.wav|39|I have had a good life.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_204.wav|105|He knows a lot.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_002.wav|31|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_011.wav|104|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_043.wav|44|This is purely financial.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_241.wav|21|We did not complete the process.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_129.wav|44|We have great team spirit.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_299.wav|24|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_118.wav|30|Stalkers are capable of killing.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_025.wav|92|It has never been worthwhile.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_076.wav|28|I was shocked and outraged.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_335.wav|11|And we have beaten them before.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_119.wav|2|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_230.wav|25|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_385.wav|1|It was a very difficult decision for us.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_104.wav|76|We shall be victorious.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_397.wav|16|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_029.wav|35|It shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_324.wav|23|I bought a car at auction.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_218.wav|12|Roy Keane is certainly the best.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_334.wav|99|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_305.wav|50|The judge was really nice.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_101.wav|37|It will take a few years before we see the full benefit.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_430.wav|65|Equipment is also a problem.)
DUMMY2/p317/p317_083.wav|97|That would open the gates of hell.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_078.wav|63|Talk of a crisis is absurd.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_188.wav|95|Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_396.wav|2|What happened in the summer?
DUMMY2/p323/p323_114.wav|34|We were a shambles at the back.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_047.wav|77|There was no safety net.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_217.wav|68|They had given up on him.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_008.wav|34|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_140.wav|23|I've been very nervous.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_180.wav|41|He will need that machine.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_126.wav|38|It is a time bomb.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_129.wav|19|Raymond was always on the outside.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_204.wav|12|Donald was a man with many friends.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_048.wav|22|I try not to expect anything.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_259.wav|17|That could be at least five years away.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_292.wav|43|It goes back a long way.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_283.wav|74|Such as it is.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_076.wav|41|And if he hadn't become a musician?
DUMMY2/p293/p293_386.wav|23|Michael's putting on a brave face.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_104.wav|104|I asked to take it up to Glasgow.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_489.wav|24|He is not a dancer.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_108.wav|58|He has one son and one daughter.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_071.wav|12|For me, the tour is wide open this year.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_185.wav|24|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_230.wav|29|He must get to know himself.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_295.wav|91|Broomfield was the centre of the town.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_314.wav|48|how do you get it back ?
DUMMY2/p282/p282_166.wav|83|It has to be now.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_326.wav|48|They are looking at a flotation.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_150.wav|79|And it was great for me.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_369.wav|33|This was not the show for me.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_021.wav|23|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_198.wav|67|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_007.wav|32|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. )
DUMMY2/p266/p266_193.wav|20|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_075.wav|94|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_059.wav|92|I knew there was a challenge for me.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_287.wav|19|The end result is precisely the same.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_021.wav|5|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_261.wav|59|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_027.wav|13|Eriksson did his countrymen a disservice.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_352.wav|51|Their condition was described as stable yesterday.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_148.wav|78|I am the manager of Scotland.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_250.wav|36|That is still in place.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_290.wav|59|This is a huge confidence boost.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_238.wav|84|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_251.wav|57|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_130.wav|80|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of a nation.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_277.wav|91|Little Voice is on general release.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_377.wav|58|Chris Paterson is a class act.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_282.wav|75|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_291.wav|99|What has altered?
DUMMY2/p227/p227_261.wav|29|You can feel at home in China.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_025.wav|17|He was the youngest of the British team.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_031.wav|58|It has moved on in the last week.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_295.wav|78|Do you think we are a top nation ?
DUMMY2/p310/p310_018.wav|17|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_057.wav|65|Do I have a favourite?)
DUMMY2/p298/p298_072.wav|68|What do they pay to join the club?
DUMMY2/p229/p229_264.wav|67|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_054.wav|29|I could not do it.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_089.wav|3|What do we do ?
DUMMY2/p292/p292_272.wav|13|Her body was found on Monday morning.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_222.wav|31|It's not ideal.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_080.wav|52|They said our costs were too high.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_297.wav|59|The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_079.wav|7|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.)
DUMMY2/p345/p345_368.wav|82|Anything that was going, really.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_192.wav|75|I have spoken to head office.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_232.wav|43|My wife and family are the support system.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_074.wav|39|It is a job creation scheme.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_140.wav|88|It won the match.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_325.wav|36|It is all credit to them today.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_304.wav|84|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_231.wav|98|Cars are great for going long distances.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_010.wav|94|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_023.wav|30|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green yellow light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_423.wav|105|They should not be blamed for it.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_002.wav|53|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_021.wav|93|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_295.wav|96|Police were on the scene within minutes, but the killer had fled.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_126.wav|24|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_136.wav|95|It does not even have a staff shortage.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_193.wav|106|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_325.wav|13|This is the last chance, and everyone knows it.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_184.wav|2|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_041.wav|20|It's the only thing.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_313.wav|70|We are in the end game.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_368.wav|103|Such actions are rarely popular.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_113.wav|37|Those people must be accountable.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_451.wav|36|We have the location, which is assured.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_207.wav|32|It was worth a photograph.)
DUMMY2/p231/p231_044.wav|50|He declined to reveal the offer price which was accepted.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_033.wav|48|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_356.wav|36|It is all about having physical evidence.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_055.wav|83|Our people are ready.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_211.wav|66|I think the Government should pay for that.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_335.wav|41|It should be a great game, though.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_016.wav|92|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_306.wav|92|We're all going to take a holiday.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_045.wav|21|So, it took me back to boarding school.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_233.wav|106|It would make a lot of sense.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_267.wav|74|It was bound to happen, and it has happened.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_116.wav|54|My daughter is an adult.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_465.wav|48|Recent reports suggested it might be sold off.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_131.wav|58|A teacher is, really, about unity.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_186.wav|64|No, they have not.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_276.wav|78|The company still had the confidence of its bankers, he said.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_342.wav|8|They were impressive against France.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_010.wav|87|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_211.wav|86|It had all been arranged.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_317.wav|7|This would provide a significant and welcome boost for local employment.)
DUMMY2/p274/p274_053.wav|32|We felt it was sufficient.)
DUMMY2/p230/p230_026.wav|35|Smoking is also very important.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_152.wav|73|It has to be now.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_225.wav|0|how do you get it back ?
DUMMY2/p340/p340_130.wav|74|You need that freedom in society.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_287.wav|107|I'd love to be like Peter.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_157.wav|102|You might even have seen him.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_057.wav|16|What was the main difference?
DUMMY2/p226/p226_144.wav|43|Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_255.wav|13|What does she consider her greatest achievement?
DUMMY2/p239/p239_455.wav|48|And Michael was just great.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_003.wav|96|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_315.wav|104|The document is a starting point for discussion.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_176.wav|67|We have to move forward.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_278.wav|93|It has been achieved by hard work and careful planning.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_155.wav|69|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_196.wav|62|He had a heart problem.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_179.wav|2|The goals were good.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_090.wav|83|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_206.wav|74|They are very clever and very dangerous.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_351.wav|27|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_370.wav|40|Colour was at the core of his life.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_435.wav|24|No date has been fixed for his return.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_258.wav|10|Defensive stocks attracted some interest.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_400.wav|47|Then , he laughs.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_160.wav|60|However, we will have to wait and see.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_168.wav|98|Their vision was not impeded.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_278.wav|20|They seem to get away with it.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_076.wav|93|She died in hospital two hours later.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_262.wav|86|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_280.wav|18|But that's another story.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_351.wav|79|From the opening Could It Be Magic?
DUMMY2/p266/p266_099.wav|20|Journalists should make him.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_079.wav|61|Two Israeli cabinet ministers were in the building at the time.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_199.wav|39|My main concern is that public health is not put at risk.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_271.wav|0|It disappeared into the cup.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_263.wav|41|That decision is for the British Parliament and people.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_356.wav|15|They will do something big.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_346.wav|69|As, indeed, they would be.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_341.wav|106|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_091.wav|9|Until you hit the big games.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_228.wav|49|My dad was working in Ayrshire.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_401.wav|64|I think it can count against you now.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_019.wav|22|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_166.wav|29|What happened in that game ?
DUMMY2/p339/p339_335.wav|18|We won't do that.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_062.wav|32|It's not covered by the insurance.)
DUMMY2/p280/p280_085.wav|52|No plans for projects are yet in place.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_109.wav|99|I thought it was a fantastic game.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_246.wav|66|I think however, he was having a fit!
DUMMY2/p267/p267_015.wav|0|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_390.wav|79|It is planned for London in the spring.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_046.wav|30|He could face a jail sentence.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_040.wav|49|It opens the door to the Champions League.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_402.wav|47|That is not in the interests of anyone or any party.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_205.wav|43|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_332.wav|79|Yet the job is far from over.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_035.wav|106|There was a rush of water.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_227.wav|28|I was very, very happy.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_047.wav|27|There is no reason at all.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_243.wav|48|was everything done to save people ?
DUMMY2/p258/p258_174.wav|26|There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_210.wav|38|You have obviously got an answer to it.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_048.wav|102|But all forms of the illness are treatable.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_356.wav|1|The guys have really enjoyed it.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_029.wav|46|So now this series has had its day.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_474.wav|24|I am certainly thinking about retirement.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_218.wav|1|You remember how long he lasted?
DUMMY2/p334/p334_047.wav|38|And the funny thing is, they usually do.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_336.wav|28|I'm sure that clubs will all be delighted.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_092.wav|14|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.)
DUMMY2/p302/p302_134.wav|30|It has been in place since last July.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_190.wav|86|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_098.wav|94|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_068.wav|102|How things have changed since then.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_176.wav|31|You had to go and see him.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_364.wav|24|Three years ago he would have been.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_016.wav|59|Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_156.wav|64|Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_397.wav|48|Because of that I didn't enjoy the game.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_106.wav|23|It was different in the endurance events.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_073.wav|93|I was as strong as a horse.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_016.wav|9|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_240.wav|34|The key issue for us is public safety.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_160.wav|39|She will do for me.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_193.wav|95|There was no hint of scandal.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_080.wav|31|Nothing is yet confirmed.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_084.wav|84|It is not a story.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_133.wav|10|That would open the gates of hell.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_379.wav|100|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_346.wav|61|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_151.wav|72|I'm pleased for him.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_141.wav|84|Mr Hall is believed to have broken a leg.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_214.wav|84|That will be vital.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_350.wav|43|That is the very reason why it was so vital.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_307.wav|80|I was concerned with the way they tried to justify his actions.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_396.wav|92|This would give Scotland around eight members.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_369.wav|99|There is no signature.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_231.wav|103|My preference is for the single vaccines.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_337.wav|78|They have to be addressed.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_216.wav|89|The report is due out next month.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_337.wav|42|You are going to take away my life.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_140.wav|17|However, they will only be found in the wild.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_248.wav|98|She has insisted she did nothing wrong.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_421.wav|74|We made a world record together.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_320.wav|96|Referees are easy targets.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_333.wav|103|Overall, though, it has been a pretty good week.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_303.wav|34|Detection is often difficult.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_256.wav|75|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_150.wav|31|It would be a last resort.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_345.wav|61|They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_094.wav|26|But it was a pleasure.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_198.wav|92|At least two women were among those arrested.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_421.wav|50|There is a solution, she believes.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_377.wav|34|He asked how they were doing.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_377.wav|23|This must be kept in total perspective.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_159.wav|69|They should come clean.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_457.wav|95|I'd never run for them.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_107.wav|37|Their mandate is to target inflation.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_068.wav|1|I think it is a release of tension.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_084.wav|32|They lived for their children.)
DUMMY2/p261/p261_274.wav|100|He said he intended to push for a judicial review.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_066.wav|18|But that title is a mistake.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_017.wav|31|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_271.wav|83|She failed in her action.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_152.wav|2|It was only a matter of time before someone was killed.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_161.wav|29|They want to see him.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_310.wav|16|You should be.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_341.wav|10|How independent is that ?
DUMMY2/p318/p318_145.wav|19|However, it is not all bad news for women.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_310.wav|52|This is the version which appeared in our paper.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_101.wav|78|On Saturday, it was much the same.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_265.wav|63|We have no information on Iraq.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_083.wav|2|It will be tight.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_385.wav|87|Venus rejects the very suggestion.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_203.wav|16|It had all been arranged.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_015.wav|61|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_355.wav|94|The train was on time.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_085.wav|10|It was worth a photograph.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_138.wav|26|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_233.wav|44|Mr King, who was present at yesterday's hearing, refused to comment.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_257.wav|47|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_178.wav|72|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_245.wav|5|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_393.wav|39|She has a little boy.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_264.wav|28|She's now on the back benches.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_100.wav|56|Athletics is on a roll in the country.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_031.wav|88|But at the moment there isn't the budget.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_088.wav|38|They will pass it on to Jim Wallace, the justice minister.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_238.wav|37|Five years later, the deception continued.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_341.wav|11|I'm looking forward to that.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_133.wav|42|Come to that, is any of this really happening?
DUMMY2/p293/p293_300.wav|23|We remain committed to it, as does the government.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_309.wav|78|But it is a similar problem.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_243.wav|35|In many ways, that is as important.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_106.wav|96|It was really enjoyable on Saturday.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_046.wav|10|How are you, sir ?
DUMMY2/p263/p263_215.wav|39|This decision was taken with the full support of Scottish ministers.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_335.wav|5|He loved the moment.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_030.wav|20|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_081.wav|87|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_385.wav|103|We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_035.wav|27|We speak about the performance.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_416.wav|76|But it's not the end of Scottish football.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_202.wav|91|There are some serious ethical issues involved.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_101.wav|92|We want to be separate from our neighbours.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_146.wav|16|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_312.wav|87|Everyone can have their opinion.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_258.wav|44|They have a very good method of working.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_203.wav|90|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_027.wav|28|She is an angel.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_175.wav|61|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_392.wav|47|He is on the wrong side.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_265.wav|95|It depends on Labour, not on us.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_348.wav|56|Everything in golf is a balance.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_223.wav|47|It was good fun.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_041.wav|38|It was an accounting error.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_080.wav|65|Put simply, it goes something like this.)
DUMMY2/p335/p335_345.wav|49|The songs are just so good.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_419.wav|63|It had been on the cards.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_069.wav|91|I'm just feeling very tired - but it's great.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_033.wav|99|They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_294.wav|31|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_040.wav|93|It's a real threat.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_005.wav|96|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_153.wav|107|I'm afraid to say anything.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_286.wav|78|It should be noted that he has been released without charge.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_033.wav|5|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_210.wav|15|What do you want to say?
DUMMY2/p308/p308_217.wav|107|It used to bother me sometimes, but it doesn't any more.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_297.wav|67|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_320.wav|2|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_016.wav|8|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_317.wav|36|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_114.wav|91|He took away my childhood.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_219.wav|101|They did not attack the themes of the book.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_216.wav|30|A judicial review is also being considered.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_123.wav|55|They pointed to the site.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_443.wav|24|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_276.wav|55|All films open tomorrow
DUMMY2/p288/p288_001.wav|47|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_362.wav|92|One Minister said the reports were bizarre.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_014.wav|28|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_211.wav|16|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_340.wav|21|We're not comparing like with like.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_093.wav|95|We have to offer value for money.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_083.wav|36|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_246.wav|89|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_035.wav|46|His views are hardly surprising.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_316.wav|50|We're on our way.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_016.wav|25|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_001.wav|104|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_313.wav|76|Some of their movement was excellent.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_079.wav|65|Only water is currently allowed.)
DUMMY2/p257/p257_158.wav|105|There's a pause.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_192.wav|76|Stan is a vital part of our future.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_382.wav|87|Six games without defeat is the legacy so far.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_095.wav|74|He said he never saw it.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_470.wav|7|They were good years for him.)
DUMMY2/p341/p341_121.wav|66|We are going to go about our lives.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_363.wav|91|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_074.wav|74|I'm sure that they will learn.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_063.wav|2|Robin Williams is very subdued.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_019.wav|97|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_104.wav|37|That would be the case with Dundee.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_334.wav|35|It was always an option.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_422.wav|14|The projections are very positive for South Africa.)
DUMMY2/p335/p335_128.wav|49|It was meant to rival the dollar.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_262.wav|81|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_331.wav|103|As often as not, the cause remains a mystery.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_143.wav|98|This is a war over our home.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_422.wav|63|That was a touch of class.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_280.wav|45|We have to break that cycle.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_134.wav|19|At some point, the bill will be presented.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_398.wav|82|This was a unique election.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_231.wav|66|He is well respected by his colleagues.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_358.wav|102|You see, my back has gone.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_355.wav|83|This is a club on the rise.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_341.wav|55|They emerged before the patients left hospital.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_384.wav|85|Maloney is an engaging talent.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_239.wav|54|So the process was refined.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_167.wav|44|What, they maybe have three Scottish players?
DUMMY2/p364/p364_005.wav|88|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_276.wav|68|Drugs and housebreaking are linked.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_256.wav|36|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_258.wav|82|We're looking for unity in the council.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_063.wav|77|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_105.wav|12|People just came on their own.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_055.wav|14|We have to keep our clients.)
DUMMY2/p339/p339_271.wav|18|It was my whole life.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_040.wav|81|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_308.wav|94|Graeme was prepared.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_130.wav|8|Are they free ?
DUMMY2/p330/p330_191.wav|1|It has all been positive.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_175.wav|38|Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_325.wav|53|His name was first linked last year to Business for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_145.wav|56|And does it ?
DUMMY2/p297/p297_161.wav|42|If we live forever, can we really be said to live?
DUMMY2/p230/p230_342.wav|35|In the old days, it was easy.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_130.wav|13|I had a train to catch.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_120.wav|3|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_351.wav|91|He knew it would cost him millions.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_385.wav|53|Why do it otherwise ?
DUMMY2/p363/p363_231.wav|6|They chose the latter.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_354.wav|40|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_279.wav|76|Why should he go anywhere?
DUMMY2/p231/p231_086.wav|50|Strathclyde Police declined to comment.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_259.wav|30|Of course we make mistakes, but we don't make too many.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_132.wav|26|They made such decisions in London.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_137.wav|15|There is a subtle difference.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_285.wav|62|Inquiries are ongoing into this incident.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_167.wav|0|The people are the hero.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_275.wav|86|It's so awful.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_223.wav|83|It's not before time.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_004.wav|47|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_266.wav|36|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_265.wav|18|We are deeply concerned at the announcement.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_317.wav|26|Kids are terrible.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_253.wav|40|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_192.wav|15|Something happened on that island.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_402.wav|33|It has proved a double whammy.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_339.wav|23|They would love to do more films.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_309.wav|74|What is their concern?
DUMMY2/p249/p249_162.wav|80|Neither side can win this war.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_343.wav|23|It raises a serious question mark.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_041.wav|54|Players were held in equally low regard.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_354.wav|52|Friday night was a pretty good night.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_228.wav|53|Royal Bank provided debt funding for the deals.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_040.wav|34|They were not up to speed.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_017.wav|5|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_045.wav|43|This represents a tough game for us.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_388.wav|49|I can't believe what has happened.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_248.wav|1|The principle is quite clear.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_026.wav|102|This is not a floating Las Vegas.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_221.wav|45|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_184.wav|23|It was his job to check.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_219.wav|83|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_380.wav|13|Scottish teams have got to take their chances.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_256.wav|71|"There is no link."
DUMMY2/p281/p281_443.wav|36|We just thought it would be kept under the carpet.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_328.wav|49|Again the parallel with football can be drawn.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_400.wav|65|The tickets are on their way.)
DUMMY2/p335/p335_187.wav|49|We do things in an appropriate way.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_323.wav|26|It is a private matter between the firm and our staff.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_327.wav|98|One would not want to go there anyway.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_013.wav|36|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_375.wav|51|We want to keep the pound.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_169.wav|9|Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_121.wav|51|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_250.wav|90|It was a hit.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_364.wav|96|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_118.wav|94|This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_070.wav|99|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_006.wav|101|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_321.wav|99|Her husband was very concerned that it might be fatal.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_076.wav|76|This was much worse.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_228.wav|15|Sadly, they did not.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_292.wav|62|Trevor has been great.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_374.wav|64|I'm just looking to take my chances.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_364.wav|64|Here is a tale of devotion to duty.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_071.wav|49|I, like many others, will consider where we go from here.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_067.wav|42|BIG Brother is listening to you.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_035.wav|16|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_016.wav|13|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_335.wav|16|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_035.wav|50|I became a widow overnight.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_252.wav|11|It was like a scene from the Holocaust.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_409.wav|33|Ministers are not involved in these discussions.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_318.wav|4|But this one has a lot of potential.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_298.wav|36|Hopefully, this week will be good.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_042.wav|80|It's a crucial award.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_069.wav|96|We welcome the decision of Mr Byers.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_426.wav|65|She had black eyes.)
DUMMY2/p294/p294_186.wav|104|The fire was falling from the sky.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_334.wav|61|I saw some good things.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_007.wav|77|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_388.wav|72|But let's not go down that road.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_209.wav|105|It had all been arranged.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_200.wav|44|But, because of the wood, no-one had the experience.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_374.wav|67|It is not too late to get on board.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_300.wav|9|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_083.wav|73|Maloney is an engaging talent.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_054.wav|68|You've got to have everything inside with you.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_135.wav|21|It's about doing things.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_048.wav|91|I try not to expect anything.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_317.wav|32|Saturday's match was fairly straightforward.)
DUMMY2/p299/p299_362.wav|58|It was to get even better for Motherwell.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_045.wav|0|I guess I was lucky, though.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_146.wav|64|There is no sign of anyone being hurt.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_138.wav|67|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_129.wav|8|I was on a roll.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_317.wav|77|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_252.wav|63|Pensions are a long-term investment.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_363.wav|94|Tyson is overwhelmed.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_039.wav|57|She is believed to be in South Africa.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_303.wav|52|Are you from the rugby ?
DUMMY2/p275/p275_278.wav|40|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_177.wav|92|A bit of match fitness is required.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_324.wav|10|Saturday's match was fairly straightforward.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_226.wav|23|They have to come up with a solution.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_338.wav|33|That's just the kind of thing we have.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_288.wav|39|He has not created a Festival resource.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_160.wav|9|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_274.wav|23|There are two offerings from Scotland.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_181.wav|44|We aren't going to play better.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_372.wav|102|If he saw somebody in trouble, he would try to help.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_020.wav|3|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_378.wav|32|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.)
DUMMY2/p263/p263_032.wav|39|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_268.wav|46|The singer's condition was not specified.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_361.wav|54|They too refused to come out and talk.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_422.wav|42|It's a true story.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_324.wav|97|The orchestra is quite good, but the hall is terrible.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_130.wav|15|But he thought the overall results were good.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_502.wav|75|I stayed away from the defence.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_165.wav|5|We should do everything at a stroke.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_064.wav|68|Seven children had lost both parents.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_232.wav|88|What do you do?
DUMMY2/p307/p307_030.wav|22|He had just returned to Thailand from Canada.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_160.wav|10|The strong performance is expected to continue.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_288.wav|61|You know the type.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_174.wav|107|They did, too, but it didn't matter by then.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_279.wav|47|You've got to have both sides.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_050.wav|106|But not a penny has been paid.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_056.wav|76|I've really noticed that this week.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_415.wav|32|It's just a training thing.)
DUMMY2/p274/p274_430.wav|32|The need for any new UN resolutions will be put on hold.)
DUMMY2/p288/p288_322.wav|47|My body is clearly capable.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_222.wav|37|People have been wonderful beyond belief.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_389.wav|41|At the last I found a bunker.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_278.wav|69|It was a virus.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_185.wav|27|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_048.wav|35|It was bound to happen.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_280.wav|79|I can't wait for it to come out.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_163.wav|104|He deserves a second chance.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_437.wav|106|I always savour the company of The Voice.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_393.wav|11|They do it properly.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_263.wav|64|I heard some of his remarks.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_412.wav|75|He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_205.wav|58|The actors are confident and polished.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_292.wav|76|Colonel, About this committee that is coming.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_280.wav|71|"Parents should avoid it."
DUMMY2/p278/p278_329.wav|10|She had gone to the Catholic school.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_246.wav|48|Not a great deal has changed in the last decade.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_330.wav|64|Treatment is aimed at the symptoms.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_401.wav|29|After the match, do you ?
DUMMY2/p302/p302_246.wav|30|Thankfully, there were no reports of anything serious.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_341.wav|24|Will have consequences for Scottish universities.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_367.wav|45|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_053.wav|9|We were surprised to see the photograph.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_250.wav|19|The bottom line is that this must stop.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_296.wav|79|What do you think?
DUMMY2/p302/p302_152.wav|30|That sort of thing is long gone.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_451.wav|24|The project is entitled The Composer in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_408.wav|0|We will stand for the nation.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_463.wav|7|Quality was high in all sections.)
DUMMY2/p237/p237_222.wav|61|By hard work, is the answer.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_146.wav|61|She hopes to study in Britain one day.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_331.wav|18|Mr Blair was ready for him.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_006.wav|19|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_045.wav|10|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
DUMMY2/p302/p302_240.wav|30|I couldn't make out what was going on.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_168.wav|105|As far as we were concerned the deal with Kennedy was dead.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_203.wav|75|This youngster is so exciting!
DUMMY2/p232/p232_170.wav|96|We've made a couple of albums.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_076.wav|99|It works for us.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_167.wav|53|However, it's possible that Dick can influence some Dutch players to go there.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_077.wav|80|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_010.wav|21|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_466.wav|50|He is well respected by his colleagues.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_117.wav|97|We must get the three points.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_098.wav|107|That certainly brought me back down to earth.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_168.wav|78|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_356.wav|26|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_405.wav|46|In the end, it will mean an awful lot.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_193.wav|26|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_080.wav|14|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.)
DUMMY2/p259/p259_074.wav|7|It makes for an interesting conference.)
DUMMY2/p275/p275_054.wav|40|That's the truth.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_254.wav|93|I have a lot of relatives in this part of the country.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_185.wav|63|At the top level, the salaries are far too high.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_322.wav|32|Is there a waiting list ?)
DUMMY2/p245/p245_161.wav|59|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_428.wav|100|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_389.wav|40|But we are a young side.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_113.wav|58|He had other things on his mind.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_325.wav|97|I am not even thinking about that.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_218.wav|43|I was so nervous.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_417.wav|36|How do you take them away ?
DUMMY2/p228/p228_208.wav|57|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_191.wav|7|We've just had it confirmed.)
DUMMY2/p237/p237_031.wav|61|We want to ensure that the process is entirely transparent.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_234.wav|3|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_307.wav|35|It could well be military.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_215.wav|91|The Yugoslav army will still be there.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_068.wav|0|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_080.wav|30|You, the British people, are the boss.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_199.wav|91|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_253.wav|84|This year I understood.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_119.wav|23|Their conditions are described as serious but stable.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_314.wav|79|Many referees are on a hiding to nothing.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_011.wav|65|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. )
DUMMY2/p312/p312_179.wav|62|You can't keep them separate.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_148.wav|85|Feel for five seconds.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_159.wav|36|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_356.wav|28|If he saw somebody in trouble, he would try to help.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_343.wav|63|My body is clearly capable.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_293.wav|2|What has altered?
DUMMY2/p310/p310_400.wav|17|Which brings us to the Scottish connection.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_132.wav|48|Is there a waiting list ?
DUMMY2/p294/p294_072.wav|104|I found the course inspiring.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_150.wav|91|But it looks good for next year.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_282.wav|10|These figures are truly terrible.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_370.wav|17|Alex is a big part of that future.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_409.wav|70|We went straight into the bedroom.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_170.wav|82|Inspiring public confidence is crucial.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_128.wav|27|The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_317.wav|13|He was always nice to me.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_062.wav|41|He had no enemies.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_016.wav|79|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_022.wav|107|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition on a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_267.wav|78|But we were in control at that point.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_337.wav|68|Sentence was deferred for background reports.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_106.wav|38|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_228.wav|12|They may yet have the last laugh.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_169.wav|26|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_360.wav|28|There is no musical background in his family.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_167.wav|63|It should never have happened.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_021.wav|60|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_023.wav|50|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_373.wav|82|The winner will be announced in December.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_332.wav|70|This is a friendly match?
DUMMY2/p252/p252_015.wav|55|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_235.wav|89|Our policy is clear.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_314.wav|2|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_009.wav|33|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_167.wav|82|The result is utterly compelling.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_449.wav|27|It will determine whether an offence has occurred.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_190.wav|38|That night was a terrible muddle.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_279.wav|46|The women were on their way home yesterday.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_188.wav|37|He is survived by his wife and two sons.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_294.wav|24|I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_298.wav|11|I couldn't make out what was going on.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_333.wav|68|In her opinion, the rich are different.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_042.wav|18|It was electric, amazing.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_264.wav|19|We are playing them at their own game.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_302.wav|53|And does it ?
DUMMY2/p233/p233_060.wav|84|He looks as if he could be worth the risk.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_295.wav|27|We are not going to forget.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_252.wav|58|We have a lot of sympathy for applicants.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_099.wav|11|He loved it, and so did they.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_122.wav|66|He had other things on his mind.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_249.wav|1|Talks will then resume again in the autumn.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_046.wav|25|We will push.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_385.wav|55|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_390.wav|64|We have chosen for the patients.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_304.wav|88|This was repeated the second time.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_025.wav|100|They are very clever in their use of words.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_172.wav|48|This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_230.wav|82|They are very frightened.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_240.wav|16|It was a kind of contempt.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_109.wav|0|We have a training class.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_374.wav|72|I wish him well.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_062.wav|84|That is all in the past.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_280.wav|61|That decision is for the British Parliament and people.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_381.wav|105|So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_097.wav|39|Mr Blair should be warned.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_400.wav|72|It is the worst of both worlds.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_116.wav|52|Had this been common practice ?
DUMMY2/p257/p257_121.wav|105|This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_249.wav|46|I am happy to play for Aberdeen.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_064.wav|54|This rule is archaic.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_225.wav|38|That's a lot of bodies to tolerate.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_346.wav|3|For the moment, however, the position is clear.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_145.wav|103|This can only help us go forward.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_259.wav|59|I HAVE a dream.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_336.wav|104|Holiday was certainly no stranger to bigotry.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_266.wav|45|We shall rely on human beings.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_290.wav|61|He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_053.wav|89|Is a drug dealer?
DUMMY2/p260/p260_342.wav|81|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_350.wav|48|Translation - we got it wrong.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_184.wav|47|People will ask about us.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_269.wav|79|We call it marriage.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_147.wav|0|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_210.wav|74|I had just taken it off.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_068.wav|106|Both banks are heavily involved in the Scottish market.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_213.wav|60|An announcement is expected soon.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_136.wav|104|This takes the pressure off.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_132.wav|27|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_117.wav|60|This is a classic.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_201.wav|49|Broke the birdie record.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_276.wav|72|It was by the numbers.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_425.wav|106|But nothing could be done.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_055.wav|53|Andy was a huge influence yet again.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_264.wav|9|We are ready.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_139.wav|15|He didn't get out much.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_014.wav|77|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_284.wav|83|This is a national crisis.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_194.wav|65|So what happens next?)
DUMMY2/p271/p271_345.wav|27|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_003.wav|7|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  )
DUMMY2/p317/p317_250.wav|97|Today, however, half of them get this financial help.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_318.wav|62|She had kept the news from him.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_348.wav|53|And that is the bottom line - box office.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_132.wav|99|It's the big omission.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_171.wav|96|My life has been destroyed.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_024.wav|105|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_381.wav|106|Women were mostly notable by their absence.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_199.wav|60|They are protesting, but they know it cannot go on.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_358.wav|13|Tiger is the exception.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_267.wav|32|I should think so, too.)
DUMMY2/p306/p306_294.wav|12|In the old days, it was easy.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_076.wav|6|Somebody should have noticed that something was wrong.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_284.wav|35|What was the matter for concern ?
DUMMY2/p283/p283_234.wav|95|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_009.wav|68|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_340.wav|89|She said they would appeal.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_418.wav|100|Overall, the labour market continued to tighten.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_460.wav|37|It is business as usual.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_369.wav|57|There is no signature.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_079.wav|12|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_242.wav|13|His musicals were very much of their time.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_096.wav|76|That's the National Grid.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_371.wav|42|What has changed?
DUMMY2/p252/p252_246.wav|55|Wall Street provided the British market with little fresh direction.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_227.wav|105|They had no children.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_090.wav|32|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.)
DUMMY2/p234/p234_296.wav|3|The results are expected within days.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_058.wav|81|There's a danger.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_331.wav|10|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_408.wav|62|There was someone on the floor.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_001.wav|57|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_311.wav|106|Downing Street insisted, We have made clear that the deadline is absolute.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_091.wav|65|They are a different team at home.)
DUMMY2/p363/p363_180.wav|6|Will he be here for the weekend?
DUMMY2/p234/p234_195.wav|3|At that point, the structure of the board was changed.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_300.wav|54|Nobody even knew it had happened.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_217.wav|43|It's not ideal.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_296.wav|64|That sort of thing is long gone.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_101.wav|89|It was clear.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_431.wav|106|We have no information on Iraq.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_158.wav|27|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_363.wav|51|It was a job he loved.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_160.wav|97|How can you not react?
DUMMY2/p275/p275_329.wav|40|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_119.wav|82|I'll just have to live with that.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_089.wav|31|They've got to account for it.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_186.wav|95|It's never great to finish second.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_265.wav|25|It looks as though he will be right.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_450.wav|24|And we might go back.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_232.wav|15|That had never happened.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_141.wav|71|"There is a lack of chemistry."
DUMMY2/p232/p232_051.wav|96|Here's a clue.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_333.wav|33|But he seemed to enjoy the challenge.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_241.wav|50|The parties have no contact.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_013.wav|85|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_245.wav|58|Mind you, who wouldn't?
DUMMY2/p339/p339_129.wav|18|I don't think the referees are against us.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_146.wav|24|You've got to be vigilant.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_431.wav|89|We are all equal.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_022.wav|57|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_156.wav|78|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_282.wav|77|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_005.wav|27|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_417.wav|100|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_336.wav|94|In the old days, it was easy.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_295.wav|45|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_192.wav|103|River City is a showcase for Scottish talent.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_226.wav|22|If not, a deal could take many months.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_030.wav|43|Because we do not need it.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_371.wav|0|to have products for their needs.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_294.wav|61|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_306.wav|8|Selection is not in my hands at all.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_225.wav|103|Her husband had been waiting for her return.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_320.wav|72|He was rejected because he had retired.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_177.wav|21|Two others were also seriously injured.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_110.wav|10|Scotland will be an integral part of Abbey National.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_091.wav|95|He has been a success this year.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_377.wav|93|He later became a respected High Court judge.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_419.wav|78|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_332.wav|97|The effect was almost magical.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_090.wav|89|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_331.wav|41|It has moved on in the last week.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_001.wav|91|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_111.wav|2|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_317.wav|48|Who was she ?
DUMMY2/p253/p253_076.wav|70|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_004.wav|36|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_300.wav|14|It's all designed to speed up the service.)
DUMMY2/p276/p276_372.wav|106|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_049.wav|77|It is quite a figure.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_017.wav|62|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_244.wav|66|It was a big day.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_014.wav|6|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_320.wav|14|I first met him last summer.)
DUMMY2/p228/p228_090.wav|57|Now the system is right behind us.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_016.wav|2|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_069.wav|28|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_258.wav|61|Both reports appear in the British Medical Journal.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_316.wav|102|I've been thinking about it for a year.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_399.wav|51|Instead, it is back to the drawing board.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_275.wav|15|For some, it might not make too much difference.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_275.wav|94|We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_049.wav|64|You can't give in to the vandals.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_209.wav|68|He wins the match with a passionate, committed, almost demented, display.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_393.wav|2|But we are a young side.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_396.wav|53|We are keen to see truth and justice.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_074.wav|66|The feeling is awesome.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_287.wav|88|It does and it doesn't.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_312.wav|51|That only came out during a radio interview.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_368.wav|77|He expected a conclusion by next Thursday.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_239.wav|66|I lost it at the final whistle.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_335.wav|100|I would do away with the dress code.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_161.wav|53|This man could yet win over Scottish hearts.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_243.wav|36|This is the year of the Tiger.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_323.wav|81|Henman has been warned.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_319.wav|7|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.)
DUMMY2/p292/p292_092.wav|13|His presence was very important.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_413.wav|18|I saw it later in the news.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_108.wav|24|We knew they could do it.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_223.wav|65|IT has been a tough year for Scottish business.)
DUMMY2/p314/p314_131.wav|51|For me, it's a tension you can feel.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_126.wav|28|Another casualty yesterday was John Prescott.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_204.wav|27|We believe a third party was involved.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_421.wav|78|One day, he threw the baby against a wall.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_308.wav|44|He moved back to Edinburgh, where he lived with his mother.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_095.wav|37|It wasn't possible to relax.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_226.wav|16|They tried to give her advice.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_219.wav|69|At the time, he was a living legend.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_279.wav|31|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_127.wav|12|I went straight to the toilet.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_061.wav|1|I find it rather oppressive.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_296.wav|38|He also wants to play in this game, and that's important.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_057.wav|94|None has ever been found.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_365.wav|36|I got a yellow card.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_300.wav|0|It's difficult to predict the future.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_370.wav|97|Someone else can do the cooking that night.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_455.wav|37|Stagecoach is seeking a new finance director.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_307.wav|16|Work has started.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_203.wav|64|Because of this, he feels the hearing had been unfair.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_310.wav|42|Your father was a good man.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_391.wav|94|If you look at the other galleries in this area.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_337.wav|10|We are on a four-year mission.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_276.wav|64|It's a way of making a mark.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_117.wav|48|Those people must be accountable.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_365.wav|29|What do they want us to do ?
DUMMY2/p303/p303_142.wav|44|It was tough, but we did have a lot of possession.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_128.wav|90|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_290.wav|84|All options are open.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_056.wav|67|We've got a lot of respect for the Lions.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_208.wav|60|That remains the unanswered question.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_266.wav|67|That is highly unfair.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_080.wav|38|The feeling between the two men was mutual.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_179.wav|50|But one was not enough.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_376.wav|6|He was a legend.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_387.wav|1|Was it just negligent.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_091.wav|3|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_246.wav|11|Meanwhile, the business of government goes on.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_208.wav|89|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_305.wav|86|And he goes with it.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_171.wav|64|It is true, but it is only part of the issue.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_169.wav|30|We must put a marker down.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_386.wav|7|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.)
DUMMY2/p287/p287_123.wav|77|I felt he was excellent.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_182.wav|25|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_212.wav|50|Which isn't a bad idea.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_174.wav|96|I always felt they played for me.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_158.wav|30|A hospital spokeswoman described his condition as stable.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_109.wav|21|Not that it was needed.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_015.wav|29|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_180.wav|102|You will never forget the clutching horror.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_070.wav|13|Three penalties were given.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_367.wav|22|Stock markets will be watching closely.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_346.wav|75|It's a policy which has worked for us.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_005.wav|98|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_185.wav|7|Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.)
DUMMY2/p250/p250_422.wav|24|The BBC was a disgrace.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_154.wav|68|That gives us something to kick against.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_097.wav|47|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_327.wav|19|Medical staff are with them at the moment.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_042.wav|23|Sub Not Used, McCormick.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_344.wav|4|They will now get that support.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_144.wav|75|Like the others, he was arrested.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_024.wav|88|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_469.wav|100|They are defined by law.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_012.wav|29|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_132.wav|20|Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_232.wav|69|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_273.wav|54|I hadn't seen them in eight years.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_001.wav|28|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_183.wav|78|I would like to see the figures  for the second quarter.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_034.wav|49|There are some serious ethical issues involved.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_226.wav|87|Stagecoach is seeking a new finance director.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_389.wav|33|It's easy to see why.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_309.wav|82|A counter reaction was.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_240.wav|85|It is the men who create the demand.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_177.wav|99|And I saw the light!
DUMMY2/p236/p236_356.wav|75|So, did she meet him ?
DUMMY2/p283/p283_096.wav|95|Potions said he would drive.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_373.wav|36|The shares are a strong hold.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_067.wav|78|But that's another story for another day.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_288.wav|51|The alliance said it may not wait.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_131.wav|30|I heard some of his remarks.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_396.wav|35|What are they for ?
DUMMY2/p267/p267_146.wav|0|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_155.wav|100|The strong pound also took its toll.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_292.wav|83|But it's a subtle process.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_363.wav|47|So I left.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_121.wav|67|On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_311.wav|60|The meaning is very profound and complex.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_155.wav|17|We started with that.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_389.wav|37|I've had three shots and got nowhere near.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_150.wav|29|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_040.wav|51|We have reacted well to each other.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_234.wav|76|Is it the shape of things to come?
DUMMY2/p310/p310_079.wav|17|He would be with his peers.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_160.wav|38|That is not just my personal view.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_235.wav|87|They've got some extremely good players.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_079.wav|1|I could do a better job.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_064.wav|22|We tried everything, but it just wasn't to be today.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_135.wav|56|Behind him was his brother.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_096.wav|13|Let's see that increase over the years.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_018.wav|12|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_372.wav|51|We were short of athletes.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_105.wav|73|It was the eighties.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_067.wav|0|There could be a way back.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_362.wav|57|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_363.wav|76|This is an internal matter.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_152.wav|12|We came across the first set of bodies.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_287.wav|69|There's a pause.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_240.wav|5|It is hard won.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_310.wav|35|We have a clean bill of health.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_303.wav|37|I think, therefore I am ?
DUMMY2/p257/p257_327.wav|105|Look at the witnesses.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_294.wav|11|This is a club on the rise.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_003.wav|17|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_129.wav|106|They lived for their children.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_113.wav|13|The squad is too small.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_375.wav|96|It was a double tragedy for the family.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_311.wav|22|Both sides have to step back.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_076.wav|32|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.)
DUMMY2/p295/p295_026.wav|92|She was on the edge of breaking point.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_178.wav|31|A helpline number is published at the end of this article.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_293.wav|65|Rangers was on the agenda and I am interested.)
DUMMY2/p288/p288_388.wav|47|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_374.wav|31|Not because they want to sing about something.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_365.wav|18|This is a new beginning.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_172.wav|41|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_196.wav|85|The Prime Minister was informed on Thursday.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_032.wav|81|There's a story, too.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_267.wav|77|There's not much money in cycling.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_253.wav|77|No production contract is yet in sight.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_350.wav|11|We were unlucky not to score.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_089.wav|89|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
DUMMY2/p300/p300_365.wav|102|Both are national treasures.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_053.wav|77|The motive for the shooting was not known.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_196.wav|96|I came home by ambulance.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_219.wav|59|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_068.wav|37|In fact, it was Geoffrey Robinson.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_278.wav|27|She failed in her action.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_116.wav|12|He was the deputy editor at the paper.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_338.wav|103|It might have been a satanic ritual.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_406.wav|52|We were on top and could have won.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_395.wav|21|Each one is as good as the other.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_072.wav|62|It showed him the way to drive.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_422.wav|54|The euro is your money, it is our money.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_169.wav|56|You know the sort of thing.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_064.wav|91|We tried everything, but it just wasn't to be today.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_045.wav|58|It should be a great game, though.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_265.wav|20|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_032.wav|13|I don't expect to be here tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_034.wav|105|President Bush is at war.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_058.wav|25|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_355.wav|27|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_192.wav|71|"I came home by ambulance."
DUMMY2/p272/p272_109.wav|69|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_385.wav|10|Scrutiny by the European Parliament is limited.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_274.wav|85|The princess has strong links with Scotland.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_038.wav|74|This is my personal assessment.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_305.wav|29|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_092.wav|80|Every time I play I do not understand their reaction.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_046.wav|88|So what did he do?
DUMMY2/p253/p253_135.wav|70|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_429.wav|48|We are facing a health disaster if we do not act.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_259.wav|44|Do you think you have a shot?
DUMMY2/p299/p299_137.wav|58|They can be time consuming.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_167.wav|74|It is clear that change is required.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_355.wav|59|The pressure is on Celtic in the main.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_032.wav|104|I am delighted at Murray's appointment.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_247.wav|93|A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_386.wav|97|Bob Dylan is getting old.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_174.wav|49|It was an empowering journey.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_366.wav|14|He can handle it without any problem.)
DUMMY2/p229/p229_032.wav|67|Because we do not need it.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_011.wav|106|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_223.wav|52|My targets for the Scottish Conservative party are high.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_106.wav|43|It was some time before she found out he was safe.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_319.wav|81|Your father was a good man.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_383.wav|46|All of the names are familiar to me.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_104.wav|83|That would be unlawful.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_273.wav|25|Things can change.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_133.wav|65|I hope we've reached the bottom now.)
DUMMY2/p329/p329_278.wav|103|He has been campaigning for change for years.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_085.wav|48|Indeed, it is only the beginning.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_310.wav|93|We do not expect any surplus.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_095.wav|84|By then, he was walking on water.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_340.wav|82|Now it was serious.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_184.wav|39|Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_029.wav|42|I feel strongly about it.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_210.wav|76|Sadly, too, many of them are similar.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_045.wav|28|They say they feel different.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_094.wav|84|The Festival is prepared to help.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_369.wav|28|Broke down and can't be fixed.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_038.wav|105|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_183.wav|4|He looked at me before replying.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_106.wav|45|They are ready.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_356.wav|81|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_182.wav|12|She is living proof of their expertise.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_342.wav|52|Perhaps she met her husband too early, she says.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_331.wav|75|Public opinion was split on the proposal.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_312.wav|25|The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_227.wav|9|IT S the real thing, for sure.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_334.wav|15|But his attendance is not guaranteed.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_360.wav|74|It is working well.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_275.wav|45|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_315.wav|48|What are you not good at ?
DUMMY2/p282/p282_100.wav|83|It is a love affair.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_332.wav|68|I have a theory.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_366.wav|95|He was at school in Devon.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_023.wav|34|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_046.wav|58|That says something for his strength of character.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_370.wav|92|I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_165.wav|88|I really feel sorry for the Irish.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_189.wav|103|I think it's awful.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_292.wav|36|The target is to break even by Christmas.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_026.wav|29|Movement has to take place.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_074.wav|16|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_114.wav|75|The hearing was due to continue today.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_237.wav|23|That was my own personal decision.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_281.wav|69|This is a national crisis.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_056.wav|59|Sadly, it can't.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_399.wav|52|I think it's a big advantage to us.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_340.wav|85|But this isn't a play about The Troubles.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_005.wav|102|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_036.wav|28|It was my shortest audition.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_024.wav|39|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_352.wav|56|My mind is focused on the next four weeks.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_135.wav|2|It seems so long since I did the exams.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_309.wav|63|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_054.wav|93|He is too weak to move.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_430.wav|106|This would discourage investment and job creation.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_043.wav|55|This operation will change her life.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_386.wav|34|I don't have any more contact with Airdrie.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_321.wav|35|It is a road of death.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_033.wav|41|It's a matter of balance.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_392.wav|28|She said she would not welcome the flowers.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_219.wav|92|I'm very tired, but it was worth it.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_111.wav|69|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_348.wav|80|He had played well in that central role.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_421.wav|98|Let that be their memorial.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_159.wav|4|The party will make up its own mind.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_036.wav|46|It is time for a new approach.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_089.wav|106|Autumn is the time of fulfilment.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_100.wav|33|He confirmed that the document was valid.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_192.wav|1|Referees are easy targets.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_016.wav|64|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_435.wav|63|THIS is a good day for Scottish farming.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_143.wav|62|It's a fantastic achievement.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_298.wav|9|People have no choice.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_154.wav|91|It is good for their eyesight.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_315.wav|54|I think the Government should pay for that.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_156.wav|67|Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_401.wav|95|I could not live with it.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_244.wav|29|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_293.wav|37|She is currently the permanent secretary at the Department of Transport.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_254.wav|78|I was never in danger.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_394.wav|6|The whole thing has been a nightmare.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_247.wav|107|We have great sympathy with Danny.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_223.wav|48|The business has expanded rapidly, however.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_130.wav|102|Scottish Athletics is opposed to permitting a move.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_342.wav|3|We did something about it.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_069.wav|89|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_077.wav|7|I wanted to change the formula.)
DUMMY2/p303/p303_321.wav|44|It's been very exciting, very challenging, and a privilege.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_023.wav|59|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_004.wav|98|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_267.wav|6|It will be a challenging film.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_296.wav|7|These figures are truly terrible.)
DUMMY2/p272/p272_200.wav|69|Even a shopping trip was a cause for excitement.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_014.wav|33|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_192.wav|10|They were seriously after him.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_175.wav|91|I can't believe anyone would agree with it.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_331.wav|82|We will win the argument.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_384.wav|21|That is the theory.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_280.wav|35|We're trying to get rounded performers.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_174.wav|28|We are already under pressure.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_314.wav|40|We have got to get the points from this one.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_440.wav|32|The boat was fully equipped with safety equipment.)
DUMMY2/p316/p316_295.wav|85|They would have to go to the Royal.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_307.wav|60|They are not falling now.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_343.wav|68|A quality audit officer has also been appointed.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_135.wav|65|Domestic orders have also fallen since January.)
DUMMY2/p295/p295_126.wav|92|You have a very persuasive president.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_050.wav|40|Here's a clue.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_228.wav|22|More money for students would help - in an ideal world.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_400.wav|24|There was a substantial explosion.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_100.wav|30|We have no idea what caused the derailment.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_351.wav|51|It was not confirmed by Scotland Yard.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_397.wav|27|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_137.wav|28|People tended to stay there for some time.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_200.wav|55|was everything done to save people ?
DUMMY2/p282/p282_011.wav|83|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_367.wav|33|Now we see the impact of global politics.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_201.wav|92|She didn't tell me anything the night before.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_146.wav|10|I haven't made any definite decisions.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_070.wav|48|The new clubhouse was packed with people watching the game on TV.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_397.wav|17|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_339.wav|44|Some of his family still live there.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_270.wav|26|The government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_065.wav|43|You do not change overnight.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_140.wav|63|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_165.wav|71|"Military action is the only option we have on the table today."
DUMMY2/p236/p236_211.wav|75|This will be our new beginning.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_066.wav|80|There was a battle there.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_152.wav|26|These days are long gone.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_110.wav|25|I don't have many friends.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_398.wav|85|I was the sheep.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_269.wav|48|This comes down to a problem of arrogance.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_123.wav|92|If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_446.wav|39|He deserves a second chance.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_252.wav|44|Sub Not Used, McKenzie.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_179.wav|46|The same goes for personnel.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_085.wav|43|It can be halted.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_017.wav|8|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_104.wav|27|I'm not looking for a breakthrough.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_038.wav|96|It was fit for royalty.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_136.wav|58|The road was closed for several hours.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_051.wav|92|I think it was entirely the right decision.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_044.wav|8|Not if you know the person.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_079.wav|89|I had my suspicions.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_104.wav|69|I love the Dome.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_357.wav|77|I have a moral dilemma.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_008.wav|47|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_292.wav|50|I've lost all confidence.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_422.wav|78|I am delighted for them.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_409.wav|56|Russell is delighted with them.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_140.wav|29|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_234.wav|50|It is set in Paris.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_181.wav|17|I see the extended family once a year.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_169.wav|91|They were behind the wheel.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_129.wav|94|It's terrible that he has died the same way.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_152.wav|20|The weather forecast isn't good.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_130.wav|61|It's terrible that he has died the same way.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_024.wav|106|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_027.wav|84|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_340.wav|65|In Great Britain, it has a life of its own.)
DUMMY2/p333/p333_169.wav|64|They tried to give her advice.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_295.wav|67|These figures are truly awful.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_170.wav|44|That, in our view, is an important decision.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_373.wav|22|And the reason isn't too hard to fathom.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_059.wav|72|For a moment it was all about her.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_005.wav|82|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_008.wav|23|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_124.wav|55|Tony Blair said as little.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_259.wav|43|Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_418.wav|13|It can happen to you, it can happen to anyone.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_041.wav|76|But he is not using them.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_086.wav|26|Until you hit the big games.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_087.wav|35|It was not an insult.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_178.wav|88|We want him to continue that way.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_418.wav|92|We suspect he was pleased.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_256.wav|52|The British Government should follow the Irish example.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_271.wav|24|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_393.wav|21|You take a risk.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_191.wav|72|There is a demand for another hospice.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_254.wav|19|We feel it sends out the wrong message.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_079.wav|15|I don't know what it means.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_272.wav|22|Drink and petrol prices remain untouched.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_078.wav|48|I haven't got there yet.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_150.wav|57|Had she enjoyed the experience ?
DUMMY2/p231/p231_215.wav|50|That might help a bit.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_034.wav|1|They could move in at any moment.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_044.wav|83|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_409.wav|49|We could play someone else, but he is ready to play.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_308.wav|29|He will address the nation this evening.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_064.wav|15|Seems a sensible compromise.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_120.wav|40|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_225.wav|80|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_120.wav|83|Who would be a referee?
DUMMY2/p267/p267_262.wav|0|The capital costs are modest.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_383.wav|34|The law will take its course.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_082.wav|87|But I had never been in a theatre.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_065.wav|40|Try to save us.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_372.wav|33|The police have to act to help them.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_265.wav|99|This is a question of Islam.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_109.wav|106|Even the one she loved.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_025.wav|88|Is that not pathetic?
DUMMY2/p334/p334_132.wav|38|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_132.wav|1|They want to avoid a flashpoint.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_003.wav|50|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_077.wav|85|This is a big step up.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_276.wav|91|Many other Scottish locations also feature.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_049.wav|57|But it might have done.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_266.wav|105|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_303.wav|69|He is also keen to win the European order of merit.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_304.wav|21|Is it the flight?
DUMMY2/p243/p243_319.wav|53|That's the danger when you have to play too many young players.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_338.wav|37|We've had him with us for the past six weeks.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_392.wav|91|Muslim leaders in Italy have denied the charge.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_043.wav|21|We've all been here before.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_449.wav|65|The festival runs until Tuesday.)
DUMMY2/p308/p308_329.wav|107|She had gone to the Catholic school.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_276.wav|48|It is fairly specialised and mainly for the export of breeding animals.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_015.wav|53|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_320.wav|52|The team spirit that was here last year is again good.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_479.wav|7|Some problems were too complex.)
DUMMY2/p299/p299_174.wav|58|He was as good as his word.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_216.wav|62|There were no casualties.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_302.wav|43|Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_171.wav|102|We want to help them through it.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_149.wav|63|Are you going to win ?
DUMMY2/p283/p283_031.wav|95|Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_285.wav|26|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_417.wav|97|The police have to act to help them.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_177.wav|5|The goals were good.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_354.wav|6|I am not sure.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_376.wav|18|They want it to work.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_111.wav|79|I'm not looking forward to it.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_390.wav|106|We can't give any figures for Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_170.wav|77|I am not ready to walk away.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_126.wav|56|We'll have to think about it.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_226.wav|81|They tried to give her advice.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_034.wav|77|President Bush is at war.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_023.wav|28|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_389.wav|63|The director will be present.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_072.wav|78|It is only the beginning.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_365.wav|76|They took a risk.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_033.wav|20|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_053.wav|53|He said he still planned to go ahead with deep tax cuts.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_165.wav|12|Playing in Europe is the benchmark.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_237.wav|36|It was a crazy day.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_089.wav|28|It need not be like that.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_117.wav|54|Pity he couldn't produce a winning British team.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_290.wav|35|The actor has met with Mandela.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_334.wav|74|Would that be for men and women?
DUMMY2/p329/p329_224.wav|103|It is a step on the way.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_451.wav|48|Either way, it's very funny.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_244.wav|96|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_086.wav|8|The commission initiated the necessary changes in the financial regulation.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_128.wav|78|It was far from business as usual.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_237.wav|74|After all, he is the King of Scotland.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_307.wav|62|Obviously we want to stop the rot.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_224.wav|54|Now we see the impact of global politics.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_088.wav|92|We are very hopeful he will be cleared.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_292.wav|11|Just a year later he was dead.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_036.wav|31|We do not expect any surplus.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_032.wav|106|We have the support of Scottish Natural Heritage.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_099.wav|22|Anyone remaining after that will be targeted.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_180.wav|22|I always loved the lightning in the movies.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_257.wav|22|Pig farmers are completely despondent.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_434.wav|106|The company declined to comment.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_381.wav|22|It may encourage more people to prospect.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_123.wav|32|What happened in that game ?)
DUMMY2/p312/p312_174.wav|62|I cannot say anymore.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_216.wav|61|It is a gamble.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_166.wav|62|And who would argue with that?
DUMMY2/p330/p330_229.wav|1|I've got no secret.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_107.wav|99|He pleaded for caution.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_081.wav|32|It took an option on the process.)
DUMMY2/p361/p361_105.wav|79|It may be tomorrow - but it may be later.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_018.wav|16|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_097.wav|48|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_009.wav|106|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_205.wav|32|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.)
DUMMY2/p334/p334_199.wav|38|I shall be voting Yes to support him.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_224.wav|71|"We're looking for justice."
DUMMY2/p229/p229_109.wav|67|Before the game we went for a pint.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_388.wav|16|It's like a car crash.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_035.wav|77|That period was a struggle.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_007.wav|63|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_189.wav|99|You know the sort of thing.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_192.wav|104|You can't believe a word.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_326.wav|35|That meant the search was unlawful.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_284.wav|53|The fans pay for their season tickets.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_023.wav|7|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. )
DUMMY2/p265/p265_100.wav|73|The cause of the fire is not yet known.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_352.wav|27|Until they came to do it.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_131.wav|12|That group reported just before Christmas.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_137.wav|1|He was obviously very genuine.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_185.wav|78|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_358.wav|43|You must have a government and a good civil service.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_405.wav|68|He showed he has some things to learn.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_065.wav|19|The house was so well alight.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_238.wav|49|I look for dancers who are also actors.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_402.wav|87|There is no change in principle from the White Paper.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_316.wav|56|Scotland has shown the way.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_050.wav|60|It is like a football team.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_002.wav|24|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_021.wav|84|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_219.wav|36|What do we want to do that for ?
DUMMY2/p347/p347_372.wav|46|You realise what this means?
DUMMY2/p273/p273_368.wav|56|Lord Macdonald has worked on this deal for three months.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_336.wav|31|Gaelic provision continued to be good.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_294.wav|62|Rather than answer, she resigned.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_086.wav|81|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_147.wav|21|On the other hand, the poster did not help.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_081.wav|57|People must remain vigilant.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_405.wav|34|The house was full of smoke.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_132.wav|92|I can't see myself in one of those.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_325.wav|32|Had this been common practice ?)
DUMMY2/p297/p297_329.wav|42|Off with their heads.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_330.wav|55|We want immediate action.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_181.wav|98|This is not the case.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_350.wav|41|I kept going for her.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_072.wav|7|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.)
DUMMY2/p260/p260_331.wav|81|There was no time scale.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_271.wav|40|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_170.wav|42|Which is worse?
DUMMY2/p351/p351_001.wav|33|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_118.wav|28|Two things will count for us in Brussels.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_132.wav|71|"It's not true."
DUMMY2/p305/p305_123.wav|54|There has been no delay on government orders.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_362.wav|95|In the old days, it was easy.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_120.wav|69|It is so sad.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_077.wav|23|We also hope to meet the men.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_021.wav|34|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_265.wav|68|I've seen some of the submissions.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_093.wav|91|Three other people were treated for minor injuries.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_351.wav|49|He denied that taxpayers money was involved.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_040.wav|50|Last year, I was pretty bad.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_286.wav|57|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_416.wav|15|He is wanted by German police for questioning.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_225.wav|2|But she was.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_242.wav|23|She had been in Germany for medical treatment.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_160.wav|19|He had never run the distance before.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_428.wav|39|Together, we can make a difference.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_159.wav|6|We still have to wait for that.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_033.wav|79|It is a case of taking a risk.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_234.wav|106|It was started almost by accident.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_061.wav|87|Everything is possible in football.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_087.wav|84|So is that it, then ?
DUMMY2/p276/p276_053.wav|106|The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_094.wav|77|The cause of the fire is not yet known.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_305.wav|95|It looks as though he will be right.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_014.wav|80|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_090.wav|22|We will learn lessons from what has happened.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_036.wav|83|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_427.wav|65|In practice, the economic tests have to be met.)
DUMMY2/p340/p340_105.wav|74|We believe it to be completely without merit.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_394.wav|66|Maybe, who knows?
DUMMY2/p265/p265_141.wav|73|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_182.wav|90|They will run a mile.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_407.wav|70|That may be.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_289.wav|5|Dialogue is the key.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_249.wav|7|It's easy to be negative about these things.)
DUMMY2/p330/p330_037.wav|1|Jock Brown is appointed as general manager.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_252.wav|12|I just saw them for a few minutes.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_218.wav|29|The move follows a review of the Singapore
DUMMY2/p225/p225_325.wav|101|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_139.wav|71|"I think he's the favourite, no question."
DUMMY2/p307/p307_322.wav|22|It's a record label, not a form of music.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_109.wav|91|Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_034.wav|19|That is impressive by any standards.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_186.wav|97|Aye, but who do you really support?
DUMMY2/p258/p258_250.wav|26|We decided we would go for a specialist inside centre.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_318.wav|97|In fact, it might just be beginning.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_312.wav|35|The songs are just so good.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_038.wav|107|It's a delightful idea, but a distancing one.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_353.wav|36|I think this proposal is excellent.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_239.wav|56|Kingfisher can afford to wait.

DUMMY2/p333/p333_227.wav|64|Sadly, it took a tragedy to change things.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_072.wav|25|Scotland had great assets.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_138.wav|11|It was the only possible decision.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_290.wav|86|A new school will be built.

DUMMY2/p236/p236_146.wav|75|He could do nothing about it.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_035.wav|59|So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_220.wav|48|Russell did not appeal the committee's decision.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_102.wav|72|There, you were just a body.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_404.wav|95|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.

DUMMY2/p237/p237_139.wav|61|The Scottish Socialist party is also expected to attend.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_230.wav|70|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.

DUMMY2/p277/p277_165.wav|89|I've put my own money into this project.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_013.wav|99|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_194.wav|69|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_239.wav|68|I think in three dimensions.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_130.wav|72|You would be a fool not to listen.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_364.wav|1|This was another video cassette.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_168.wav|97|Sentencing is due to take place tomorrow morning.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_163.wav|60|Little is known about them.

DUMMY2/p307/p307_332.wav|22|I am not obsessed with sex.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_120.wav|46|Martin Johnson, the England captain, was back, and commanding.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_089.wav|36|IT is called a killing in the trade.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_004.wav|7|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  )
DUMMY2/p236/p236_135.wav|75|I enjoy the creative process.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_259.wav|35|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_293.wav|98|There was no secrecy.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_189.wav|20|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_233.wav|36|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_137.wav|8|The first half was depressing.

DUMMY2/p261/p261_179.wav|100|City sentiment is in his favour.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_127.wav|39|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_030.wav|60|That depends on Rangers.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_290.wav|69|What has altered?
DUMMY2/p292/p292_247.wav|13|We didn't play well and will certainly improve.

DUMMY2/p317/p317_173.wav|97|My daughter is an adult.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_068.wav|58|A number of people could not speak English.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_204.wav|57|Is that success ?
DUMMY2/p256/p256_296.wav|90|It became a book by itself.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_423.wav|36|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_272.wav|9|So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_272.wav|86|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_242.wav|77|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_225.wav|92|Parole is a decision for me.
