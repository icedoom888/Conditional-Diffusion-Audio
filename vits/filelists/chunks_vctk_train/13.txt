DUMMY2/p248/p248_270.wav|99|He is a young man with a new deal.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_144.wav|17|If Glasgow is so interested, they have the right to bid.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_240.wav|40|It is hard won.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_238.wav|85|He had a great game.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_029.wav|97|I am not a fan of stoppages.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_054.wav|79|A final agreement has not yet been completed.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_375.wav|79|There are no quick fixes.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_002.wav|28|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_118.wav|73|It plans to return to this field.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_027.wav|106|So is that it, then ?
DUMMY2/p292/p292_388.wav|13|The occasion was a conference on Scottish art.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_251.wav|26|I didn't need to watch it on the video.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_357.wav|93|They should take their mobile phones.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_031.wav|103|I had found my vision.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_040.wav|87|So is that it, then ?
DUMMY2/p260/p260_150.wav|81|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_181.wav|15|That was the finest moment in my career.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_115.wav|58|Don Hutchison, too, is a threat.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_168.wav|70|I was in the train station overnight.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_365.wav|91|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_390.wav|19|I may think about performing it.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_233.wav|88|And there are some interesting conductors, too.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_197.wav|60|Here it was very subdued.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_413.wav|8|A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_361.wav|36|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_204.wav|52|As you see with the fuel duty business, they do.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_252.wav|15|Lara is very, very much a girl.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_314.wav|29|And that culture is everywhere in Dublin.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_131.wav|66|You can see their point.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_207.wav|76|There are moments of honesty, too.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_028.wav|73|This is the window.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_323.wav|6|That is taking place in Strathclyde.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_358.wav|86|That would help.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_135.wav|90|The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_149.wav|71|"The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_289.wav|21|That is a personal matter.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_154.wav|79|The conclusion is the same.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_164.wav|0|Had I heard ?
DUMMY2/p264/p264_282.wav|65|Friday night was a pretty good night.)
DUMMY2/p258/p258_031.wav|26|Because we do not need it.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_215.wav|52|The study is entirely into the issue of future funding.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_087.wav|12|We do need a new one.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_349.wav|39|It is the same old story.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_018.wav|90|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_109.wav|70|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_223.wav|73|I can leave at the end of the day.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_117.wav|107|I want to play at the highest level.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_353.wav|56|We're still the only ones in the High Street.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_152.wav|95|I'm so grateful for that.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_089.wav|74|The money will go straight to the headteacher.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_031.wav|91|I saw the explosion and panicked.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_327.wav|77|The Premier League has been a huge success.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_199.wav|35|The result is called a patent.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_062.wav|106|Everything is possible in football.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_346.wav|100|Both men were on one-year contracts.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_145.wav|107|It is a very interesting subject.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_352.wav|94|It has moved on in the last week.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_181.wav|1|She is on a life support machine.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_233.wav|105|But it's a subtle process.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_248.wav|21|He had a great game.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_326.wav|81|The problems began a long time ago.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_157.wav|49|It's because they can't understand the language.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_147.wav|17|I've so much respect for him.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_169.wav|81|Is Saddam a threat?
DUMMY2/p247/p247_110.wav|14|Before the game we went for a pint.)
DUMMY2/p278/p278_226.wav|10|My daughter is an adult.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_345.wav|78|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_297.wav|50|He will address the nation this evening.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_396.wav|63|We have to put pressure on Rangers.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_302.wav|106|At the top level, the salaries are far too high.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_146.wav|43|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_390.wav|42|And who would argue with that?
DUMMY2/p253/p253_345.wav|70|As, indeed, they would be.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_004.wav|16|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_388.wav|53|Similar increases have been experienced by the medical defence unions.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_061.wav|7|The Farmer wants a new campaign.)
DUMMY2/p335/p335_223.wav|49|Of further privacy, he had no need.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_066.wav|35|He also received a medal of honour.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_306.wav|74|Sub Not Used, McCall.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_047.wav|16|Every aspect of our play was first class.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_372.wav|32|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?)
DUMMY2/p282/p282_357.wav|83|Their time has gone.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_019.wav|69|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_239.wav|75|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_007.wav|92|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_278.wav|32|Quality was high in all sections.)
DUMMY2/p230/p230_056.wav|35|We will pay their bills.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_289.wav|76|I'm not a threat to coaches.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_013.wav|86|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_406.wav|15|He added that he felt undermined.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_193.wav|34|We have got to get it right.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_265.wav|96|Blood samples were taken.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_261.wav|77|On the contrary they stand to gain.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_232.wav|105|John Prescott, the deputy prime minister, will fly to the summit tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_248.wav|54|They had had time for little else.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_072.wav|59|People must remain vigilant.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_132.wav|73|He realises his mistake.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_167.wav|75|Greenwood said he was happy with that.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_044.wav|29|If I was a woman.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_183.wav|5|One was a lawyer.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_221.wav|98|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_357.wav|40|That would help.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_442.wav|50|The people are the hero.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_337.wav|24|Completion of the purchase is seen by the end of the year.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_126.wav|43|It is a delight on every level.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_134.wav|26|My conscience is not clear.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_112.wav|6|I sit at home a lot.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_156.wav|5|She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_042.wav|1|We did not even get a free kick.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_163.wav|41|It has to be now.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_129.wav|4|The hearing was continued until a later date.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_224.wav|77|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_396.wav|37|Subs not used, McKenzie, Ritchie.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_368.wav|64|They should feel ashamed.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_216.wav|102|Jimmy returned to Aberdeen, but she remained with George.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_230.wav|49|It shows that painting is still relevant.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_255.wav|22|I am not holding the club to ransom.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_043.wav|65|I made my mind up before we came on tour.)
DUMMY2/p333/p333_258.wav|64|There are a few changes.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_344.wav|78|And the context is also completely different.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_071.wav|107|There is no sign of anyone being hurt.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_062.wav|67|Scotland had great assets.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_400.wav|68|The South African defended his work ethic.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_324.wav|8|Does the name matter ?
DUMMY2/p231/p231_403.wav|50|It does not even have a staff shortage.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_157.wav|0|I would probably have to agree with him.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_456.wav|75|They were not even allowed to see them.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_138.wav|96|What will happen then ?
DUMMY2/p264/p264_129.wav|65|These people were my friends.)
DUMMY2/p261/p261_023.wav|100|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_094.wav|13|He insisted that his staff were too.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_436.wav|63|But he gave no details.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_158.wav|68|She was shouting my baby, my baby.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_199.wav|36|We always felt we could win.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_388.wav|32|The group will also become an Internet service provider.)
DUMMY2/p238/p238_063.wav|37|Everything else is a bonus.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_436.wav|56|He confirmed the coaching structure was already under review.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_014.wav|100|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_327.wav|103|That will bring about a dramatic improvement.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_242.wav|0|It is the loss of my name.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_244.wav|77|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_189.wav|31|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_220.wav|58|I would have dropped out otherwise.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_235.wav|42|Some were close to tears.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_183.wav|51|He is the example for all of us.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_310.wav|106|Even more harrowing, though, was the reception from her husband and manager.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_108.wav|45|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_227.wav|38|But that attachment took a lot of growing.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_078.wav|0|He can win every week.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_252.wav|67|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_254.wav|39|Does that put pressure on us ?
DUMMY2/p314/p314_342.wav|51|His job was not advertised.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_194.wav|102|I am considered a teenager.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_173.wav|5|I drove the ball well.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_054.wav|18|I will make that point tonight.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_242.wav|63|I am not ready for Lennox Lewis.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_258.wav|104|They are in care for a reason.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_050.wav|91|There will be plenty to keep them occupied.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_166.wav|100|The region is open for business.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_210.wav|25|I don't want to use it.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_022.wav|27|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_295.wav|102|People will make up their own minds.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_012.wav|47|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_369.wav|60|I think he will.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_309.wav|10|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_157.wav|104|I was quietly confident about getting the win.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_149.wav|65|Is it in the right place?)
DUMMY2/p279/p279_320.wav|25|Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_162.wav|96|Tell it like it was ?
DUMMY2/p318/p318_192.wav|19|Stan is a vital part of our future.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_423.wav|100|The case will now go to appeal.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_027.wav|99|But it failed.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_169.wav|10|Further growth will be funded from cash flow.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_087.wav|58|We are losing this war.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_180.wav|7|The second aspect was the fear of failure.)
DUMMY2/p297/p297_290.wav|42|Taxation should be simplified.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_108.wav|74|Fishing is a declining industry.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_475.wav|65|I'm delighted for Andy.)
DUMMY2/p252/p252_327.wav|55|Not one person spoke badly.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_360.wav|10|Three years ago he would have been.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_297.wav|81|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_149.wav|80|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_298.wav|77|But it is up again.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_169.wav|53|We had to work very hard for our points.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_166.wav|11|I made a mistake.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_374.wav|51|The European is a piece of vanity publishing.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_079.wav|107|I was in jail for five years.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_253.wav|95|A career as a doctor is on hold.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_016.wav|7|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. )
DUMMY2/p284/p284_096.wav|16|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_121.wav|81|We enjoyed it today.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_077.wav|67|Two Israeli cabinet ministers were in the building at the time.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_126.wav|45|Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_362.wav|84|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_384.wav|56|It runs until the beginning of June.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_092.wav|40|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_183.wav|79|Then everyone must consider their future.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_343.wav|94|They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_306.wav|62|You can't do one without the other.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_414.wav|36|We will stand for the nation.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_087.wav|68|There were no passengers on board.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_192.wav|66|Who is he?
DUMMY2/p311/p311_235.wav|4|Barry Ferguson is one of them.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_129.wav|30|The New Deal will constantly be improved.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_125.wav|38|There is bound to be a formal complaint.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_352.wav|96|The boat was fantastic.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_055.wav|81|He has written to the minister after meetings on the island.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_339.wav|18|It's a double whammy.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_152.wav|53|Did it work ?
DUMMY2/p240/p240_376.wav|93|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_176.wav|97|Thereafter he left Scotland.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_146.wav|37|Four meetings have previously been arranged.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_018.wav|23|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_136.wav|53|Therefore, no-one can work full time in these companies.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_279.wav|13|He should be worried about me.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_016.wav|35|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_262.wav|75|It is believed the size of the settlement has not been finalised.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_366.wav|51|But let's not get carried away.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_329.wav|51|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_183.wav|102|This one was my best chance.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_213.wav|40|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_268.wav|61|That could be in place by next year.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_115.wav|64|I thought he was terrific.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_197.wav|66|The project is entitled The Composer in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_404.wav|66|Golf has lost a great character.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_052.wav|26|You must have a government and a good civil service.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_196.wav|38|He will address the nation this evening.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_137.wav|67|He is slightly confused.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_009.wav|86|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_164.wav|68|Arsenal have plenty in the tank.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_460.wav|95|I am greatly relieved that the trust has reached its target.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_027.wav|40|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_005.wav|56|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_179.wav|67|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_391.wav|13|The police are not the target.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_279.wav|41|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_182.wav|77|DAVID Sutherland does not beat about the bush.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_124.wav|89|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_052.wav|27|Here's a clue.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_184.wav|83|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_134.wav|52|There is no future in rock music.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_049.wav|101|I have learned from him.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_148.wav|40|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_375.wav|78|It is almost certain to be the last.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_265.wav|44|I've seen some of the submissions.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_091.wav|64|We are looking for volunteers.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_214.wav|47|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_027.wav|4|It is the whole package.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_228.wav|0|You could feel the heat.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_059.wav|47|Four other charges were dropped.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_041.wav|90|It had been played at festivals.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_178.wav|13|Only one person can claim the credit.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_199.wav|14|That could bring the peace process to a standstill.)
DUMMY2/p343/p343_345.wav|21|So you let me know.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_034.wav|104|Other people had looked at it.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_180.wav|44|Mistakes are being made on an increasing basis.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_276.wav|6|Can you believe it?
DUMMY2/p266/p266_407.wav|20|The weekly average was three hours.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_026.wav|95|We are a service industry.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_182.wav|51|That's when you hope to take advantage.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_037.wav|92|He must not be removed from office.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_023.wav|107|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_265.wav|49|This is my home town.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_452.wav|89|I got a yellow card.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_077.wav|31|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_349.wav|14|What do they want us to do ?)
DUMMY2/p283/p283_030.wav|95|And we have a singer.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_331.wav|64|This Patton will also return.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_072.wav|80|Try to save us.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_304.wav|91|They tried to give her advice.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_217.wav|55|The Boys can speak about little else.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_111.wav|29|Not a great deal has changed in the last decade.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_288.wav|54|My aim is a top six finish.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_124.wav|73|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_022.wav|54|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_214.wav|104|He doesn't need to be told, he knows the truth.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_367.wav|23|Hopefully, the goals will return on Wednesday.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_212.wav|6|We got on very well.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_002.wav|11|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_178.wav|50|We are the gateway to justice.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_421.wav|100|The second goal was superb.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_240.wav|59|I was shocked.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_295.wav|52|The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_356.wav|47|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_011.wav|34|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_405.wav|104|It's a tragedy for the area.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_075.wav|22|It's an excellent idea that makes sense.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_376.wav|50|We were given a break.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_307.wav|102|They are currently managed by Ian Wilson.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_106.wav|53|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_297.wav|48|You were an easy target and therefore an easy sacrifice.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_390.wav|105|There was no trouble.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_351.wav|54|Our children are our future.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_434.wav|27|Scottish public finances emerge from this review enhanced.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_288.wav|48|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_242.wav|48|And they were being paid ?
DUMMY2/p297/p297_226.wav|42|The group will report back in the summer.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_256.wav|26|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_384.wav|107|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_329.wav|18|He is in charge on the pitch.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_100.wav|107|We have no idea what caused the derailment.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_223.wav|51|We don't say there was a massacre.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_397.wav|107|The report is due out next month.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_195.wav|49|The overall effect is impressive, but distancing.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_168.wav|42|That could be in place by next year.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_034.wav|11|What you sow, you have to reap.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_106.wav|4|He, too, will return.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_007.wav|99|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_088.wav|33|One year later, he finally decided to act.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_315.wav|37|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_256.wav|70|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_274.wav|0|He will emerge as a world leader.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_175.wav|30|It is time to come into the limelight.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_220.wav|34|We did not even get a free kick.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_105.wav|7|But they must believe in themselves.)
DUMMY2/p245/p245_022.wav|59|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_342.wav|77|A Home Office spokesman said.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_373.wav|26|He could face a jail sentence.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_004.wav|57|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_095.wav|66|It's a difficult one to play.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_361.wav|7|Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.)
DUMMY2/p273/p273_228.wav|56|We have not been approached.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_137.wav|48|Gary Parker is a favourite of mine.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_022.wav|48|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_128.wav|5|It's perfectly feasible.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_173.wav|62|This remains the party's policy.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_216.wav|83|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_307.wav|26|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_266.wav|16|We're in shock.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_117.wav|47|There were no grounds for his action.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_203.wav|6|I really had to concentrate.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_119.wav|14|This is a step backwards.)
DUMMY2/p264/p264_248.wav|65|They were game, but not very good.)
DUMMY2/p323/p323_359.wav|34|I thought it was a fantastic game.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_017.wav|24|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_189.wav|106|The changes took effect from June.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_032.wav|105|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_174.wav|20|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_359.wav|12|It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_194.wav|25|The procedure is the same in all cases.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_049.wav|11|His condition was serious but stable.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_079.wav|0|By then, he was walking on water.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_208.wav|13|We've got better players here.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_250.wav|37|My Dad is a hero.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_144.wav|60|That was worth it.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_266.wav|31|He can do everything.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_388.wav|97|And he is immensely loyal.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_252.wav|69|George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_348.wav|46|He's got a great chance of making it.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_326.wav|26|There was some merit in that.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_345.wav|104|Where are you taking her?
DUMMY2/p277/p277_020.wav|89|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_148.wav|89|The role of the law lords would be retained.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_067.wav|40|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
DUMMY2/p301/p301_378.wav|91|There is no openness.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_169.wav|7|He was right into football from an early age.)
DUMMY2/p265/p265_165.wav|73|It is not either national standards or local control.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_271.wav|9|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_077.wav|77|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_190.wav|79|Actors like to be in the centre.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_329.wav|20|Is there a new way forward?
DUMMY2/p241/p241_295.wav|86|However, the snow was welcomed by some.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_493.wav|24|The striker needed attention before he could resume.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_272.wav|39|It seems a shame to leave it.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_008.wav|27|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_204.wav|66|It's up to their parents to choose.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_029.wav|71|"Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format."
DUMMY2/p264/p264_421.wav|65|They could change them tomorrow.)
DUMMY2/p281/p281_441.wav|36|He deserves a second chance.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_247.wav|46|We are still getting signals.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_269.wav|35|I've had no discussions with the chairman of the board.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_340.wav|4|This Government is cutting taxes.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_064.wav|17|We shall not do that.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_098.wav|32|I did not concentrate on my performance.)
DUMMY2/p277/p277_435.wav|89|However, he held out little hope that the Government would take action.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_029.wav|74|But it's not just about that.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_307.wav|79|They have to get that sorted.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_140.wav|56|Today is not a victory.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_409.wav|0|I'm pleased about one thing.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_169.wav|51|That doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_323.wav|74|That was always the danger.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_074.wav|28|More patience and composure was required.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_368.wav|47|Not so, it seems.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_028.wav|104|For the moment, our position remains the same.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_127.wav|34|I would never say anything against her.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_293.wav|34|Maybe his time has gone.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_155.wav|103|I guess it is down to focus.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_028.wav|107|Alright, it was a defeat, but it felt like a victory.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_306.wav|103|But we'll just keep trying to get results.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_123.wav|18|But there was everything!
DUMMY2/p300/p300_004.wav|102|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_159.wav|60|I didn't think we deserved to go out.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_394.wav|35|I had a fortunate war.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_163.wav|74|What then is wrong?
DUMMY2/p259/p259_340.wav|7|The results are sometimes contentious.)
DUMMY2/p241/p241_012.wav|86|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_361.wav|8|We have very limited capacity.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_265.wav|23|It was not the greatest performance, but it was effective.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_314.wav|63|The effect was almost magical.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_246.wav|9|I think a move would create a lot of interest.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_092.wav|77|This decision is a farce.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_393.wav|34|Hours later, she was found dead by Ms Wilson.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_327.wav|73|Tell us about it.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_126.wav|84|There were no grounds for his action.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_227.wav|2|My wife and family are the support system.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_011.wav|36|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_333.wav|85|It is the wealthiest in Europe.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_253.wav|39|Did he trip ?
DUMMY2/p333/p333_288.wav|64|It's too big a risk to take.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_113.wav|76|We played so well at times.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_168.wav|76|This one is a special case.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_371.wav|45|It was a funny game.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_170.wav|48|There's still plenty time left.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_353.wav|95|And he goes with it.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_289.wav|13|This is his first movie.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_249.wav|4|However, many of their victories have been close affairs.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_363.wav|13|Glasgow is far from overload.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_337.wav|22|His English counterpart agreed.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_109.wav|81|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_375.wav|10|He must have seen the movie.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_020.wav|60|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_095.wav|93|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_316.wav|32|Shareholders will be asked to approve a new replacement scheme.)
DUMMY2/p263/p263_440.wav|39|I was in a position to challenge for this event and didn't.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_330.wav|67|It could have gone either way.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_227.wav|74|So there, we won.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_417.wav|38|Some things in life you have to accept.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_257.wav|53|Commercial producers were present in large numbers.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_039.wav|70|Indeed, he does.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_073.wav|85|He was also a great man.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_369.wav|91|Moving from Manchester to London was upheaval enough.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_089.wav|34|An announcement will follow in due course.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_239.wav|60|No-one expected that their parents would stay.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_057.wav|14|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?)
DUMMY2/p270/p270_214.wav|8|There can be no compromise on that demand.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_271.wav|65|I see no reason to doubt that the situation in Scotland is any different.)
DUMMY2/p228/p228_295.wav|57|It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_303.wav|42|It was quite a new prescription.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_199.wav|30|All the names are familiar to me.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_146.wav|32|The whole industry is a shambles.)
DUMMY2/p261/p261_058.wav|100|How are you, sir ?
DUMMY2/p310/p310_118.wav|17|It may be argued.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_199.wav|79|People are trying to run away.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_034.wav|46|That didn't happen for two reasons.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_119.wav|51|They have got their position, we have got our position.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_377.wav|32|Those people must be accountable.)
DUMMY2/p227/p227_238.wav|29|William Hague delighted his party.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_189.wav|83|However, he had not yet been charged in connection with the robbery.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_167.wav|2|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_110.wav|105|It is normal.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_032.wav|5|He was jailed for five years.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_280.wav|77|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_362.wav|2|They believed it worked.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_327.wav|46|It's fantastic to have finally won.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_323.wav|14|There was no hint of scandal.)
DUMMY2/p252/p252_001.wav|55|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_075.wav|30|He now lives in Edinburgh with his wife, Caroline.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_112.wav|44|Tell you the team he picked?
DUMMY2/p229/p229_113.wav|67|I don't have many friends.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_285.wav|36|And they were being paid ?
DUMMY2/p363/p363_355.wav|6|One might think that it is a power.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_264.wav|47|The government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_008.wav|14|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. )
DUMMY2/p259/p259_021.wav|7|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. )
DUMMY2/p336/p336_026.wav|98|She took them for a term.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_132.wav|5|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_265.wav|64|It has to be funded.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_226.wav|85|However, it proved to be the turning point.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_036.wav|43|It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_379.wav|19|I enjoy the creative process.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_095.wav|45|FOR once, you should believe the hype.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_123.wav|75|I was on a roll.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_217.wav|76|He did his best, but it wasn't good enough.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_289.wav|67|What would be the timetable for withdrawal ?
DUMMY2/p343/p343_269.wav|21|People should make their own decisions.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_310.wav|25|The letters are going out today.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_393.wav|100|The pair are very much in love.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_147.wav|67|Nobody in the world can get away from him.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_373.wav|20|So there, we won.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_158.wav|46|That's been our position all along.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_162.wav|23|However, the great thing is that it doesn't matter.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_389.wav|69|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_318.wav|105|Finally, he paid for the movie.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_017.wav|82|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_280.wav|88|We have to get on with it.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_270.wav|8|how do you get it back ?
DUMMY2/p330/p330_234.wav|1|To a level which we consider appropriate.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_316.wav|12|I've been thinking about it for a year.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_120.wav|15|The fire was still coming down.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_379.wav|37|It represents a complete change in emphasis.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_424.wav|60|As for Owen, class is permanent.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_244.wav|27|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_001.wav|105|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_213.wav|20|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_025.wav|56|A shortlist is to be drawn up next month.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_119.wav|107|It ignores the future.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_131.wav|93|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_359.wav|104|My fitness was very poor.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_040.wav|80|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_340.wav|20|Maloney was asked.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_153.wav|47|It has to be now.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_095.wav|2|It is a love affair.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_248.wav|66|I will not be pressured.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_120.wav|72|Strikers like to go to the ground.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_031.wav|17|And the winners are.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_035.wav|9|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_264.wav|106|The family kept away from me.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_114.wav|96|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_236.wav|50|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_062.wav|52|The referee is there to decide these things.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_087.wav|31|It is a lifeline.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_234.wav|90|It's quite nice.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_185.wav|79|We want to be part of it.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_104.wav|5|It was an adventure.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_254.wav|98|He has refused to do that.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_370.wav|105|However, it's good to turn the page.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_412.wav|49|The game is now open.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_296.wav|43|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_012.wav|3|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_255.wav|66|Do not listen to them.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_344.wav|29|Public opinion was split on the proposal.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_073.wav|4|I have spoken to the skipper.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_189.wav|97|This makes no sense!
DUMMY2/p277/p277_454.wav|89|Scotland has a dismal record of teenage pregnancy rates.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_399.wav|21|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_136.wav|82|Our destiny is in our own hands.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_183.wav|11|It was just one of those days.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_077.wav|39|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
DUMMY2/p285/p285_287.wav|2|No Briton has ever won.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_066.wav|67|Try to save us.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_141.wav|77|She had gone to the Catholic school.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_167.wav|70|Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_284.wav|49|Bob Dylan is getting old.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_325.wav|34|Then there is the terrain.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_214.wav|67|The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_126.wav|61|I thought it was a fantastic game.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_410.wav|18|We have got to deal with it.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_216.wav|45|His death was a tragic accident.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_080.wav|74|There was no commission.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_300.wav|26|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_059.wav|43|She's a spy!
DUMMY2/p257/p257_314.wav|105|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_442.wav|100|Everything in golf is a balance.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_300.wav|1|We have to offer value for money.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_112.wav|55|There was no reason.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_328.wav|21|We must learn to finish.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_170.wav|80|I'm so worried about the roads.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_147.wav|16|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_324.wav|28|I've only met him three times.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_256.wav|50|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_009.wav|48|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_222.wav|9|Work has started.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_196.wav|57|We are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_171.wav|63|It's never great to finish second.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_261.wav|85|There were no reported casualties on the ground.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_173.wav|61|He is keen to stay in public service.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_093.wav|28|This time, there were no such rewards.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_329.wav|73|But we finished the show.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_285.wav|98|The cause remained a mystery last night.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_197.wav|94|Mr Kennedy is not a candidate for the Scottish Parliament.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_050.wav|17|Again, that was genuine loyalty being recognised.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_415.wav|62|Golf has lost a great character.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_338.wav|12|That decision was applauded by Williamson.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_110.wav|15|There have been so many.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_412.wav|89|I reminded myself that we were not talking about a death.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_239.wav|49|However, civil rights campaigners welcomed the ruling.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_183.wav|88|He had a horror.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_299.wav|6|He will have it within two weeks.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_028.wav|65|We're only taking on a couple just now.)
DUMMY2/p304/p304_226.wav|72|I never agreed with that.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_179.wav|65|You can spend money on housing.)
DUMMY2/p248/p248_344.wav|99|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_041.wav|18|I didn't expect to get one.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_347.wav|1|We have to learn lessons from these things.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_055.wav|92|Such debate is pointless.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_395.wav|52|In that situation, they thought we should be beaten.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_152.wav|64|However, in Orkney, there was a mixed response.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_264.wav|39|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_143.wav|85|They exist in name alone.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_172.wav|62|Charges against the pair were found not proven.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_040.wav|63|It is serious - but not that serious.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_055.wav|6|Who will pay for this?
DUMMY2/p330/p330_031.wav|1|The problem in Norway is outside the National.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_500.wav|75|A Scotsman has to defend his castle.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_154.wav|69|I was so nervous.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_364.wav|98|He was not alone.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_316.wav|44|Tony Blair, can you see her face?
DUMMY2/p262/p262_014.wav|45|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_035.wav|26|It was clear.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_018.wav|45|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_229.wav|37|That view has not altered.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_017.wav|28|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_268.wav|92|This latter point is hugely important.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_075.wav|88|It's not in my nature.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_036.wav|23|There is a growing anger among the group.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_135.wav|82|He would just say it was terrible.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_366.wav|77|It's a policy which has worked for us.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_171.wav|27|Tell it like it was?
DUMMY2/p313/p313_211.wav|76|I suspect that it will.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_209.wav|23|Clearly, we could go on like this all day.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_083.wav|33|I just wanted to get off the course.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_231.wav|36|Basically, they have to come up with the offer.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_222.wav|49|This fact is supported by audience research.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_385.wav|45|Apart from the result we have to be happy with our performance.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_121.wav|39|Pupils will be the losers.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_404.wav|103|The film is about the cost of genius.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_152.wav|14|What do we want to do that for ?)
DUMMY2/p333/p333_380.wav|64|All of the names are familiar to me.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_156.wav|62|It is almost certain to be the last.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_265.wav|79|When she returned, it was a wreck.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_017.wav|93|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_215.wav|21|The hearing was fair.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_251.wav|22|We kept going right to the final whistle.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_193.wav|6|Their appeal will be heard this week.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_270.wav|11|All of us do.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_207.wav|83|The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_126.wav|68|Will they ever reopen?
DUMMY2/p248/p248_194.wav|99|However, this idea is never developed.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_265.wav|85|Another issue will be policing.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_318.wav|83|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_457.wav|100|No one wants to go through these things.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_240.wav|17|We can't get over it.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_072.wav|5|Even the one she loved.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_422.wav|98|We thought we were looking in good shape.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_235.wav|44|I spoke with just one player, but not the others.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_066.wav|81|And if he hadn't become a musician?
DUMMY2/p303/p303_100.wav|44|Sooner rather than later, though, the healing must begin.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_180.wav|35|She has left the island.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_046.wav|77|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_253.wav|63|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_005.wav|38|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_453.wav|37|It seemed a logical expansion.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_244.wav|13|There is great demand for human cloning.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_042.wav|69|A quality audit officer has also been appointed.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_057.wav|105|The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_367.wav|20|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_102.wav|1|The feeling is marvellous.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_347.wav|47|It was good for us that they lost that day.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_113.wav|23|The cost of war is more than that.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_305.wav|75|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_285.wav|25|It was a virus.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_076.wav|53|It had little effect on European equity markets.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_152.wav|98|Controllers major concern is safety.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_232.wav|16|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_379.wav|103|Last year, however, it was decided to dissolve the abbey.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_358.wav|37|He remains a main board director of Royal.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_374.wav|63|You need a licence to run a pub.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_020.wav|35|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_047.wav|107|They don't take you to mass graves.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_239.wav|102|It's just gotten too big.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_375.wav|75|Everyone could see the joke.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_263.wav|63|Chairman Sir Alistair Grant will remain on the board as deputy chairman.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_203.wav|15|But we have learned that it doesn't.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_367.wav|24|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_082.wav|72|We're all involved in deciding where it goes.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_161.wav|21|That never came to court as a charge.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_010.wav|40|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_119.wav|69|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_179.wav|91|There was a fossil on screen.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_273.wav|65|If I didn't go for the world record, I'd feel guilty.)
DUMMY2/p351/p351_201.wav|33|I went away to recover fully.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_276.wav|66|Their three other children had died as infants.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_229.wav|23|They will form a tribute.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_157.wav|70|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_146.wav|17|The pollution and the driving are beyond belief.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_356.wav|20|Yet he left a few days later.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_181.wav|39|The decision was blamed on weak investment markets.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_209.wav|54|Others were even less confident.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_270.wav|41|It was an easy decision to come here.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_301.wav|11|The atmosphere is businesslike.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_185.wav|47|If the director is with you.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_340.wav|13|The review has been conducted fairly.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_243.wav|75|We played them off the pitch.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_282.wav|35|And they were being paid ?
DUMMY2/p333/p333_002.wav|64|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_059.wav|64|It will come up here.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_158.wav|56|One season, they might do well.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_378.wav|87|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_130.wav|94|So the European elections are extremely important.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_361.wav|55|Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_335.wav|43|The boat was fantastic.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_164.wav|106|Hopefully, no-one will suffer too badly.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_085.wav|27|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_204.wav|72|We should not worry about other players.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_152.wav|58|It was then into overtime.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_272.wav|0|The stage was set for a showdown.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_029.wav|60|You are not allowed to do that.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_250.wav|104|There are no excuses left for us.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_338.wav|20|We've tried every other way.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_271.wav|96|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_107.wav|7|The following are the principal provisions.)
DUMMY2/p297/p297_137.wav|42|He needed a kidney - it's as simple as that.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_300.wav|84|We have to sort it out ourselves.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_043.wav|0|Everything else is a bonus.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_302.wav|9|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_180.wav|28|That was merely their initial problem.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_374.wav|54|This must have been severe.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_297.wav|64|And sooner than we may think.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_036.wav|87|We are opening an inquiry.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_063.wav|10|I'm looking to the future.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_252.wav|104|His director of football is leaving.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_298.wav|48|We may need to take some very radical measures.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_338.wav|72|It really was my favourite.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_032.wav|98|Another former manager, Bobby Robson said.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_205.wav|45|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_307.wav|89|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_036.wav|14|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.)
DUMMY2/p306/p306_357.wav|12|I've only met him three times.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_339.wav|13|This was a unique election.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_272.wav|57|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_423.wav|38|It is par for the course, isn't it?
DUMMY2/p258/p258_071.wav|26|He got the same story.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_115.wav|48|The partners are looking for answers.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_409.wav|65|You took the law into your own hands.)
DUMMY2/p286/p286_158.wav|63|No-one from the Fire Brigades Union was available for comment yesterday.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_188.wav|3|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_360.wav|38|This man is serious about his work.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_404.wav|58|The euro is your money, it is our money.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_196.wav|55|Scottish Life was there over one year.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_098.wav|26|Before the game we went for a pint.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_177.wav|104|I'm looking forward to facing the Irishmen.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_201.wav|27|I came home by ambulance.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_395.wav|103|And that started me thinking.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_008.wav|28|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_484.wav|48|Sales have been perfectly buoyant.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_260.wav|37|It's about time something was done about equipment.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_188.wav|51|It was a disaster of a race.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_053.wav|24|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_078.wav|88|Scotland were on Saturday.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_013.wav|60|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_260.wav|23|Is it the players, or is it the coaches?
DUMMY2/p248/p248_002.wav|99|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_294.wav|83|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_023.wav|31|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_342.wav|107|I just need a bit of luck.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_023.wav|64|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_357.wav|105|I wouldn't want to miss that chance.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_308.wav|89|My body is clearly capable.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_064.wav|77|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_144.wav|104|It is a question of life and death.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_291.wav|98|It's a national sport.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_138.wav|71|"We've got a lot of respect for the Lions."
DUMMY2/p277/p277_141.wav|89|I had decided to quit the show.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_276.wav|59|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_108.wav|79|The results are very positive.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_068.wav|26|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_392.wav|70|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_121.wav|79|It is just a statement of fact.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_183.wav|76|I didn't want to ignore the punters.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_129.wav|51|For sure, you won't know unless you ask him.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_308.wav|65|There was no consultation with the executive and no need for any such consultation.)
DUMMY2/p297/p297_236.wav|42|I saw it at a ruck.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_245.wav|32|Others agreed with this view.)
DUMMY2/p258/p258_217.wav|26|He seemed to lose his focus.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_210.wav|62|The next few months will tell.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_271.wav|53|That's been the difference between the sides.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_401.wav|55|I managed to do that.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_331.wav|4|That is why we are here.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_273.wav|56|Truth is the child of time.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_258.wav|9|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_332.wav|14|They come to enjoy themselves.)
DUMMY2/p241/p241_067.wav|86|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
DUMMY2/p360/p360_283.wav|60|We didn't play well and will certainly improve.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_191.wav|84|There is no point in looking any further.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_061.wav|27|That's the truth.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_223.wav|88|It would also delay the Scottish results.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_199.wav|104|That's been the case for a while.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_347.wav|72|Saddam Hussein is a devil.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_305.wav|98|We meet again in Berlin.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_048.wav|105|As she explains.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_170.wav|11|Little girls are his victims.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_277.wav|31|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_006.wav|106|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_148.wav|103|Jonny Wilkinson had an off-day on Saturday.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_132.wav|82|The whole matter is done and dusted.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_305.wav|80|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_450.wav|14|It certainly appeared that way.)
DUMMY2/p276/p276_345.wav|106|This included a downward revision in the expected level of dividend.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_181.wav|64|We might be back next year.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_188.wav|61|Government will intervene.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_197.wav|41|They've got three-quarters of the way.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_366.wav|7|Industrial action has to hurt.)
DUMMY2/p287/p287_276.wav|77|Is it in the right place ?
DUMMY2/p312/p312_242.wav|62|It's a personal matter.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_070.wav|57|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_320.wav|43|The home team had an amazing start.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_394.wav|22|It's about my time as a guitarist.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_374.wav|48|That remains the unanswered question.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_357.wav|72|These will take a little time to develop.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_384.wav|6|We are in shock.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_035.wav|14|That is the face of fear.)
DUMMY2/p335/p335_414.wav|49|Jackson may well be right.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_196.wav|46|We have no idea what caused the derailment.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_192.wav|59|We don't even know his name.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_338.wav|93|He was then replaced by Ross.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_388.wav|23|I am sure that this will happen again.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_176.wav|51|That nation is South Africa.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_049.wav|34|So, what's it about?
DUMMY2/p329/p329_222.wav|103|And we know that, because we know the hairdresser.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_073.wav|57|Sounds like The Sixth Sense ?
DUMMY2/p264/p264_299.wav|65|He had served his time.)
DUMMY2/p330/p330_354.wav|1|It is patently true.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_127.wav|72|That could be at least five years away.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_055.wav|85|But the law is very clear on this.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_163.wav|84|It is not normal practice.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_030.wav|41|The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_147.wav|50|The whole industry is a shambles.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_198.wav|38|I'm not changing my mind.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_417.wav|33|The plane was shaking.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_008.wav|86|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_316.wav|23|Last year, however, was a different story.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_241.wav|19|World leaders expressed their sympathy.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_294.wav|84|I do not think this family will ever get over this.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_040.wav|86|President Bush is at war.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_045.wav|15|His style is suited to Scottish football.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_127.wav|89|I can't even get into the A team.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_339.wav|68|Some of his family still live there.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_167.wav|32|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.)
DUMMY2/p261/p261_170.wav|100|Was it the wife ?
DUMMY2/p282/p282_306.wav|83|Is there on his hands?
DUMMY2/p280/p280_144.wav|52|They can break quickly from midfield and carry a scoring threat.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_382.wav|40|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_205.wav|74|That's my daughter acting.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_241.wav|99|We have a free vote on these things in our party.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_232.wav|66|It is anything but erotic, but that is probably the point.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_269.wav|59|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_007.wav|64|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_380.wav|2|At the last I found a bunker.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_461.wav|63|They are defined by law.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_378.wav|100|But they have taken the lesson to heart.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_328.wav|47|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_250.wav|95|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_222.wav|52|We are still seeking that complete performance.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_124.wav|75|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_205.wav|0|It has been like that all year for me.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_092.wav|99|I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_289.wav|89|I was the sheep.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_025.wav|30|It does make a big difference.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_090.wav|63|Theatre is not a museum.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_301.wav|38|But that night they killed her housekeeper.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_241.wav|13|It is up to us to approve it.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_158.wav|45|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_056.wav|24|The City welcomed the brighter outlook.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_116.wav|21|But let's not get ahead of ourselves.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_290.wav|77|He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_382.wav|13|You have to rely on each other.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_179.wav|63|The second aspect was the fear of failure.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_132.wav|62|The police have to act to help them.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_066.wav|53|Do not give your details to anyone.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_036.wav|102|He said he now intends to fly today.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_182.wav|62|That's when the story first appeared.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_290.wav|43|Scotland were beaten again.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_297.wav|101|Innocent people have a right to live in safety.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_049.wav|41|This represents a tough game for us.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_232.wav|70|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_158.wav|41|We will turn the corner.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_198.wav|39|You know the sort of thing.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_380.wav|16|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_402.wav|4|She is a veteran in the Balkans.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_084.wav|43|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_351.wav|81|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_110.wav|90|I didn't play well last year.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_289.wav|28|But their bodies were found at lunchtime yesterday.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_107.wav|106|Both sides have been hit by injury.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_157.wav|36|Had I heard ?
DUMMY2/p303/p303_205.wav|44|I'm going with all three.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_151.wav|34|We can do both.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_289.wav|14|It is a crisis of human rights, a crisis of leadership.)
DUMMY2/p299/p299_338.wav|58|We will work through the night.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_034.wav|74|Do you think they would do any better?
DUMMY2/p272/p272_288.wav|69|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_139.wav|44|Subs not used, Fernandez.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_097.wav|64|They didn't take you to mass graves.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_253.wav|47|This is a big club.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_317.wav|62|Our system is archaic.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_072.wav|53|She seemed as moved by her own words as her audience were.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_008.wav|43|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_130.wav|73|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_316.wav|33|But these things are happening now.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_020.wav|52|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_400.wav|50|I had a fortunate war.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_237.wav|97|My life is a mess.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_055.wav|91|Today, we begin to answer that question.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_307.wav|65|It's not a marketing scheme.)
DUMMY2/p303/p303_227.wav|44|It's been a long, long journey.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_090.wav|60|We will continue to provide support for them.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_349.wav|53|I'm extremely confident something will happen within the next couple of days.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_423.wav|6|He said he had no reports of casualties.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_107.wav|59|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_326.wav|53|I feel as if I can hole everything now.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_374.wav|26|The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_149.wav|81|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_218.wav|45|IT S the real thing, for sure.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_197.wav|4|He confirmed there had been no warning.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_262.wav|20|It will be done in stages.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_147.wav|97|The group is separate from the Real IRA.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_108.wav|29|It is much as it has been described.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_420.wav|1|But it looks good for next year.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_157.wav|101|He was asked to quit.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_056.wav|1|We shall not forget him.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_410.wav|98|She made no further comment.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_270.wav|97|Three further cases were confirmed yesterday in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_302.wav|11|They use them for everything.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_147.wav|37|Colin said, You get through the day-to-day by looking at the future.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_022.wav|22|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_031.wav|48|There was a rush of water.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_365.wav|7|Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.)
DUMMY2/p250/p250_131.wav|24|He thought she was amazing.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_225.wav|3|Her experience is certainly limited.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_281.wav|105|He should have won.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_358.wav|4|I am greatly encouraged.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_291.wav|17|We make good weapons.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_018.wav|35|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by the reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_012.wav|23|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_127.wav|51|I really hope he thinks that through.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_090.wav|4|It is a very special place.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_317.wav|9|We have to sort it out ourselves.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_138.wav|95|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_155.wav|0|We came across the first set of bodies.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_121.wav|1|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_080.wav|54|If you're a national company, you must provide it all.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_344.wav|37|This is a sensible and common sense approach.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_207.wav|79|These are serious matters.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_013.wav|47|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_020.wav|34|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_364.wav|48|The statement contained no surprises.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_043.wav|85|We accept the challenge.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_268.wav|27|This is a question of Islam.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_058.wav|97|I am a drug addict.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_050.wav|48|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_124.wav|100|My life has changed a lot.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_224.wav|3|The force is with them.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_235.wav|95|This will take several weeks.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_104.wav|89|I love the Dome.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_027.wav|62|The way forward is working with other disciplines.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_190.wav|84|I was totally wrong.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_350.wav|17|Or do they?
DUMMY2/p245/p245_202.wav|59|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_251.wav|0|Clearly, the need for a personal loan is written in the stars.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_301.wav|33|It was an ongoing exercise.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_034.wav|42|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_293.wav|40|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_207.wav|103|We will look into it.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_248.wav|39|We were a load of rubbish.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_058.wav|71|"This is a step backwards."
DUMMY2/p233/p233_067.wav|84|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_239.wav|21|We are expecting a big crowd.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_079.wav|6|The course has helped a lot.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_104.wav|1|It was more like a Labour Party rally.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_195.wav|95|I feel like my game has come a long way.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_297.wav|93|Who did the recruiting?
DUMMY2/p248/p248_195.wav|99|It wasn't to be.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_389.wav|7|They should take their mobile phones.)
DUMMY2/p299/p299_186.wav|58|It also highlighted some local hero districts.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_214.wav|91|Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_205.wav|6|Frankly, they have to crack down.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_368.wav|16|There was a substantial explosion.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_285.wav|9|The government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_468.wav|24|It may prove to be his last involvement with the club.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_077.wav|78|Seriously, we are not concerned at all.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_301.wav|85|She had denied the charge.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_044.wav|43|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_400.wav|0|Are they free ?
DUMMY2/p266/p266_208.wav|20|We want to keep the pound.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_210.wav|93|The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_063.wav|102|Meanwhile, the weather was causing widespread disruption.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_083.wav|24|This view was echoed by the other Scottish analyst.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_047.wav|42|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_089.wav|88|But was it really so big?
DUMMY2/p267/p267_267.wav|0|This news came after the stock market closed on Monday.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_341.wav|32|Writing has diminished in value.)
DUMMY2/p323/p323_200.wav|34|The general secretary, represents a new era in Labour party politics.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_377.wav|54|Farmers have been an endangered species.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_350.wav|6|Surely the answer is yes.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_449.wav|37|Celtic are simply trying to buy time by not paying the money.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_314.wav|3|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_125.wav|49|We represent a wide range of society.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_043.wav|59|She is believed to be in South Africa.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_354.wav|75|Why do it otherwise ?
DUMMY2/p275/p275_174.wav|40|In a way he was.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_310.wav|18|We have nothing to lose.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_091.wav|67|We must look forward.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_412.wav|63|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_019.wav|46|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_339.wav|34|Angola was a really hard place.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_318.wav|8|He has left the company.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_141.wav|76|That sort of thing is long gone.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_154.wav|9|There's a sense of excess in the novel.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_215.wav|85|They will do their own thing.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_364.wav|69|So there, we won.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_179.wav|4|Sure the COE is a cracking band.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_334.wav|85|He is on the wrong side.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_266.wav|33|However, there could be more bad weather to come.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_263.wav|19|It is up to Ann.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_386.wav|95|I believe the gap is nearly there.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_341.wav|107|She's a valuable member of the Government.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_379.wav|94|I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_232.wav|71|"Hospitals are for the ill."
DUMMY2/p231/p231_082.wav|50|It's so hard to shift.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_034.wav|106|He said police inquiries should not be conducted as political opportunism.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_288.wav|104|A great deal was achieved.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_063.wav|64|I didn't expect to get one.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_229.wav|63|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_365.wav|92|Our traditions and culture remain the same.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_274.wav|107|He always has been, since his early days with Scottish Opera.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_338.wav|55|How independent is that ?
DUMMY2/p275/p275_124.wav|40|I wouldn't have wanted any other way.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_306.wav|16|I can live with it.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_223.wav|6|The group will report back in the summer.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_305.wav|101|Cast Away now on general release.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_313.wav|32|The weather will be unpredictable if anything.)
DUMMY2/p275/p275_089.wav|40|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_390.wav|48|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
DUMMY2/p269/p269_179.wav|94|But the petrol station does not get the benefit.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_163.wav|76|It was a fiery game.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_292.wav|9|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_358.wav|98|Inside, there is a kind of madness.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_390.wav|7|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.)
DUMMY2/p329/p329_157.wav|103|I have great respect for all my players.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_189.wav|23|It's a huge amount.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_359.wav|54|They feel it belongs to them.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_029.wav|81|They have no history.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_076.wav|12|Henman is taking nothing for granted.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_330.wav|72|The matter will come up again.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_206.wav|107|He now describes himself as Scottish Labour.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_128.wav|89|I'm so angry.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_032.wav|84|Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_291.wav|28|That's my big challenge.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_339.wav|94|That's the law of the land.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_044.wav|12|We like being the underdogs.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_308.wav|56|The world record is suspicious.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_021.wav|57|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_011.wav|43|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_225.wav|32|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.)
DUMMY2/p361/p361_019.wav|79|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_183.wav|21|But experience is a wonderful thing.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_135.wav|40|What will happen then?
DUMMY2/p313/p313_054.wav|76|He will be judged by his actions.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_160.wav|98|Parliament was evenly divided on the issue.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_217.wav|53|I do not see this so much as failure.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_277.wav|89|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_074.wav|2|Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_091.wav|2|I saw the whole thing.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_332.wav|4|The German had a point to make.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_173.wav|59|We must keep our feet on the ground.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_470.wav|100|If that's the case, he will struggle.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_461.wav|8|We are now up against it.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_326.wav|54|He made so many bad decisions.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_409.wav|75|I would love to think that she could win.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_001.wav|50|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_204.wav|106|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_316.wav|59|I am very happy to be here.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_248.wav|17|It's more like a Labour Party rally.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_272.wav|100|Is it in the right place ?
DUMMY2/p340/p340_116.wav|74|I have done ever since it was published.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_096.wav|33|Surely this is not supposed to happen?
DUMMY2/p279/p279_083.wav|25|She died in hospital two hours later.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_309.wav|77|Nothing has been put into action.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_334.wav|78|Tax is a matter for national governments.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_306.wav|18|But it did not last.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_222.wav|90|He seemed to lose his focus.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_044.wav|98|This isn't a new problem.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_020.wav|50|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_108.wav|102|You either have him or you don't.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_182.wav|60|I try to be clear in the narrative.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_124.wav|26|It's terrible that he has died the same way.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_371.wav|47|The play is based on a real-life event.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_157.wav|45|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_320.wav|82|It is a symbolic concert.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_010.wav|46|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_016.wav|58|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_239.wav|11|Then it was the turn of the carnival.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_359.wav|37|People should make their own decisions.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_026.wav|47|It is a disaster area.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_248.wav|81|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_366.wav|105|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_310.wav|99|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_377.wav|38|His third goal was superb.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_005.wav|17|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_244.wav|73|I've had no discussions with the chairman or the board.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_287.wav|106|It's never great to finish second.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_335.wav|4|However, the second goal was about to be delivered.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_147.wav|29|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_403.wav|78|He is a quality player.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_282.wav|56|You have to expect this type of thing.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_456.wav|106|Last year's winner was Sergio Garcia.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_059.wav|104|We are only human.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_318.wav|32|Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.)
DUMMY2/p282/p282_038.wav|83|It was clear.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_216.wav|71|"We could be here for a number of weeks."
DUMMY2/p258/p258_235.wav|26|They should come forward.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_245.wav|95|It was a great experience.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_005.wav|77|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_221.wav|73|We are so proud.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_386.wav|20|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_121.wav|93|You can spend money on housing.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_258.wav|45|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_302.wav|81|One was a lawyer.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_220.wav|59|They had no children.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_054.wav|10|They are to ensure information reaches as many members as possible.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_345.wav|31|This is a friendly match?
DUMMY2/p335/p335_280.wav|49|Scots actors should be so lucky.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_403.wav|16|By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_149.wav|7|Commercial producers were present in large numbers.)
DUMMY2/p244/p244_379.wav|78|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_051.wav|59|It's a blessing.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_038.wav|25|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_034.wav|30|My game is in pretty good shape.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_276.wav|62|Previously police had said that schools were safe.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_162.wav|74|He, too, will return.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_206.wav|75|Motorists will buy passes in advance.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_181.wav|53|Traffic was also heavy around Strathclyde Park.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_188.wav|88|We are at war.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_100.wav|49|There are nine people here now.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_022.wav|29|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_041.wav|75|I needed a change, a new challenge.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_234.wav|34|Is your life a little too easy?
DUMMY2/p256/p256_302.wav|90|The party lasted all night.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_395.wav|102|Victory, she insisted yesterday, was far more important than the rewards.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_032.wav|54|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_190.wav|107|There was great support all round the route.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_138.wav|94|If not, a deal could take many months.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_063.wav|106|We like being the underdogs.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_379.wav|79|It's about New Yorkers.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_089.wav|97|This is rapidly becoming a fiasco.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_346.wav|1|She is very upset.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_344.wav|86|I was in a position to challenge for this event and didn't.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_139.wav|98|He is that good.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_260.wav|98|All of them were killed.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_160.wav|2|Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_197.wav|67|What has caused the demise of singing ?
DUMMY2/p232/p232_412.wav|96|Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_062.wav|59|He should have asked for a second opinion.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_161.wav|28|She wanted to move.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_178.wav|71|"It's an idea."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_301.wav|21|It was a matter of chance.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_215.wav|18|The lottery has helped.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_283.wav|26|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_288.wav|74|We could have had no new money.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_146.wav|73|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_385.wav|100|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_286.wav|60|It looks as though he will be right.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_210.wav|75|No details of the talks were given.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_287.wav|89|There's a pause.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_061.wav|105|Scotland had great assets.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_328.wav|70|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_006.wav|22|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_081.wav|105|It may well have been.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_200.wav|75|I had a train to catch.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_226.wav|26|What was the main difference?
DUMMY2/p274/p274_186.wav|32|They responded well after the run of defeats.)
DUMMY2/p262/p262_332.wav|45|I am so upset.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_232.wav|47|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_307.wav|85|Let's get to know him.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_410.wav|17|This will help our confidence.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_420.wav|97|Borrowing power was one of those improvements.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_443.wav|89|Who would be in that desert?
DUMMY2/p340/p340_363.wav|74|Governments will have to respond.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_242.wav|104|That is however, the only part of the story.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_321.wav|100|A Home Office spokesman said.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_447.wav|63|Upgrading the station has been under consideration for some time.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_037.wav|95|That means an extra two years.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_032.wav|46|It's a policy which has worked for us.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_089.wav|29|You might not make it.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_406.wav|55|Does it matter ?
DUMMY2/p329/p329_033.wav|103|But they were unable to respond in time, officials have said.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_057.wav|3|Still, he did not let himself down this week.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_312.wav|60|You just have to get on with it.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_281.wav|55|I hope numbers will be up on last time.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_122.wav|78|He was not alone at the top of the board.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_209.wav|24|It was a moment of madness.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_070.wav|78|I can't remember a lot about the accident.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_216.wav|70|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_312.wav|27|The letters are going out today.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_221.wav|91|He added later, Normally, it's not a dangerous river.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_034.wav|53|But the Sunday Herald said it stood by its story.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_175.wav|9|We wanted it left for a wee while.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_089.wav|48|Had this been common practice ?
DUMMY2/p272/p272_191.wav|69|We believe a third party was involved.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_103.wav|46|It was not a beautiful game, was it?
DUMMY2/p341/p341_112.wav|66|I love this tournament.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_348.wav|26|His contract was then not renewed.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_104.wav|95|That is the important thing.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_051.wav|49|They couldn't believe what had happened.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_323.wav|21|It is so out of character.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_202.wav|75|However, Murray Johnstone is not on the menu.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_165.wav|86|There was no respite.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_088.wav|8|The peace process will be buried!
DUMMY2/p314/p314_005.wav|51|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_377.wav|31|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_398.wav|35|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
DUMMY2/p256/p256_075.wav|90|I was as strong as a horse.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_410.wav|89|Feel the air, the space.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_345.wav|40|I believe the gap is nearly there.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_156.wav|42|My son was too young to die.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_170.wav|22|The pressure on the aid agencies is immense.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_393.wav|72|Hard it will be.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_459.wav|106|There's not much money in cycling.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_036.wav|76|The waiting is over, well almost.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_161.wav|81|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_332.wav|6|We need to regroup.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_181.wav|100|These men could be anywhere in the world.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_140.wav|76|But every two minutes it was exploding.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_285.wav|79|And he did that.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_290.wav|89|What has altered?
DUMMY2/p333/p333_094.wav|64|Subs not used, McCulloch.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_212.wav|30|River City is a showcase for Scottish talent.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_088.wav|95|It makes for an interesting conference.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_359.wav|87|Being captain of this club is fantastic.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_275.wav|46|It is a very interesting subject.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_288.wav|84|They were too hard.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_189.wav|15|The First Minister is an addict.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_049.wav|73|TODAY it begins.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_018.wav|39|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_273.wav|53|I think I was about four years old.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_149.wav|42|Golf is a game of honour and ethics.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_190.wav|12|The children, were not thought to be so seriously hurt.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_101.wav|14|It was clear on Thursday.)
DUMMY2/p374/p374_248.wav|11|It all depends on the Chancellor.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_088.wav|23|I could not believe what they were saying.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_054.wav|67|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_284.wav|98|I am not a liar.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_118.wav|47|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_041.wav|94|She is believed to be in South Africa.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_209.wav|48|He is a very talented player.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_438.wav|95|Being with me is an honour.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_391.wav|4|I had to calm down.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_318.wav|25|I came into this world with nothing.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_363.wav|103|It is playing long, but it is also in beautiful condition.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_201.wav|97|Who is the employer?
DUMMY2/p259/p259_399.wav|7|The salary changes are long overdue.)
DUMMY2/p280/p280_019.wav|52|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_441.wav|100|It is an absolute nonsense.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_089.wav|9|We must look forward.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_228.wav|67|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_370.wav|1|I have chosen to do this research.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_212.wav|11|We're very close to being a good team.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_228.wav|4|I never made any offer to Mark.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_320.wav|107|I couldn't see any reason not to die.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_331.wav|22|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_066.wav|100|Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_203.wav|93|They've got three-quarters of the way.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_137.wav|38|Inclusion and Autism, Is It Working?
DUMMY2/p299/p299_111.wav|58|I have great respect for all my players.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_110.wav|103|I bought a car at auction.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_353.wav|16|Eight months later, he was dead.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_054.wav|66|However, the appeal judges rejected the argument.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_207.wav|25|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_304.wav|23|Sergio was talking his chances down yesterday.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_330.wav|104|He wants to play in the Champions League.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_353.wav|25|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_045.wav|7|Among them are many criminals.)
DUMMY2/p326/p326_395.wav|28|It was like the old days.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_340.wav|54|Before he left, the skipper said the crew were brilliant.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_049.wav|80|I would love to have him home.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_344.wav|36|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_297.wav|42|He planned to relocate to Scotland, probably Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_156.wav|17|And he had much need.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_119.wav|19|O Neill is reputed to have replied.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_168.wav|64|They got the job done.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_190.wav|72|I saw the whole thing.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_084.wav|51|Bin Laden was not mentioned.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_332.wav|96|Horses are drawn by ballot.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_035.wav|69|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_171.wav|26|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_122.wav|54|She was eight months pregnant at the time.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_023.wav|105|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_161.wav|54|But someone forgot to tell the Chechens.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_316.wav|30|Is that Titanic?
DUMMY2/p334/p334_115.wav|38|I was very pleased with them today, though.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_251.wav|84|It was a cry for help.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_099.wav|9|That would be unlawful.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_116.wav|66|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_051.wav|52|I'm as fit as I can get.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_017.wav|47|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_035.wav|28|How would it work?
DUMMY2/p260/p260_041.wav|81|Dancing was her life.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_163.wav|63|The family kept away from me.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_088.wav|19|This could be her way forward.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_150.wav|16|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_026.wav|60|My conscience is not clear.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_175.wav|88|I'm delighted for the lads.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_064.wav|96|People love to see this stuff.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_363.wav|58|Both parties can win, and Scotland can win as a result.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_148.wav|21|In the end, we did not spend a penny on him.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_144.wav|50|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_050.wav|100|There was no safety net.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_344.wav|68|Obviously, someone is not doing their job properly.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_337.wav|61|Her husband was very concerned that it might be fatal.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_209.wav|60|Everyone is too upset to comment.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_210.wav|32|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.)
DUMMY2/p259/p259_272.wav|7|Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise.)
DUMMY2/p326/p326_200.wav|28|It may now be too expensive for anyone.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_213.wav|66|He was a soldier.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_289.wav|80|A tribunal would then consider the seriousness of the incident.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_084.wav|105|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_399.wav|95|It has only been rumours.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_326.wav|105|I've got no secret.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_375.wav|39|And I repeat, it would be for exposure and money.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_392.wav|65|We have done our own tests.)
DUMMY2/p312/p312_130.wav|62|It is a very big problem.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_020.wav|48|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_144.wav|29|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_476.wav|7|He deserved a red card.)
DUMMY2/p347/p347_416.wav|46|However, there are signs of dissent among his colleagues.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_405.wav|85|I am glad that justice has been done.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_114.wav|69|She reflects a bit.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_024.wav|71|"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue."
DUMMY2/p312/p312_388.wav|62|Nobody ever gets to see them.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_405.wav|35|It was a bank holiday, after all.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_247.wav|37|But it couldn't happen overnight.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_056.wav|39|We have not given up hope.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_360.wav|35|Not that Scotland can claim the moral high ground.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_162.wav|20|I've put my own money into this project.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_336.wav|40|In that case, we would be prepared to defend ourselves.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_248.wav|107|He should be a great asset.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_176.wav|57|And I was happy for the happiness of my brothers.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_329.wav|83|Two people were interviewed.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_184.wav|91|I'm just asking them to improve their disciplines.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_352.wav|2|The pair are very much in love.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_237.wav|27|We were awful.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_028.wav|9|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_024.wav|15|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_340.wav|84|I could hardly move for the next couple of days.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_016.wav|24|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_078.wav|33|It is tough, but possible.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_009.wav|9|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_372.wav|50|But we finished the show.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_294.wav|85|War and force are not the only solutions.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_144.wav|7|Was it the wife ?)
DUMMY2/p246/p246_195.wav|5|Who will pay for this?
DUMMY2/p259/p259_400.wav|7|The policy has led to a big increase in customer recruitment.)
DUMMY2/p286/p286_009.wav|63|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_006.wav|26|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_023.wav|48|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_166.wav|0|It's nice to be nice.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_023.wav|88|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_198.wav|53|But they had to be paid for.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_343.wav|62|This is perfectly legal.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_144.wav|34|New blood is essential for progress.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_417.wav|106|Venus rejects the very suggestion.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_150.wav|54|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_362.wav|107|So just what is her enduring appeal?
DUMMY2/p306/p306_130.wav|12|Scottish Athletics is opposed to permitting a move.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_218.wav|25|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_048.wav|0|There was no safety net.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_254.wav|52|I'd rather play well next week than here.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_302.wav|101|Three hours later, the man was free.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_154.wav|98|Because he usually is.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_077.wav|70|It is a job creation scheme.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_336.wav|9|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_220.wav|45|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_390.wav|103|It is a catalogue of obstruction.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_436.wav|95|It is based on a true story.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_083.wav|104|That was enough for the committee.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_282.wav|51|We will build upon the basic state pension.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_110.wav|34|He later paid a tribute to his opponent.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_085.wav|11|His track record is not promising.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_381.wav|50|Had this been common practice ?
DUMMY2/p305/p305_267.wav|54|The website is now being amended.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_010.wav|34|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_378.wav|46|To which the only answer is, don't hold your breath.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_120.wav|85|It's great news, isn't it.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_340.wav|58|This is entirely appropriate and overdue.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_401.wav|16|He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_345.wav|48|Another High Street retailer was not so lucky.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_312.wav|22|Lord Johnston will give a decision later.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_305.wav|87|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_430.wav|63|Nobody should believe this story.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_242.wav|44|Alcohol, of course, is strictly forbidden in Iran.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_261.wav|93|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_056.wav|77|We will pay their bills.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_277.wav|103|He doesn't do dinner.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_350.wav|84|However, it was well worth the wait.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_153.wav|81|We are on a four-year mission.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_365.wav|32|It was a unanimous decision.)
DUMMY2/p345/p345_118.wav|82|We just want a fair deal.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_293.wav|25|It changed my life.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_123.wav|102|This is not understood by people outside.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_463.wav|32|It's because they can't understand the language.)
DUMMY2/p301/p301_070.wav|91|When he took over it really took off.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_195.wav|26|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_137.wav|47|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_012.wav|89|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_246.wav|80|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_157.wav|6|It appears to have been successful.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_280.wav|93|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_406.wav|24|Rugby is a hard game.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_219.wav|70|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_092.wav|10|The palace said the Queen was deeply saddened.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_389.wav|8|The parties include the Scottish Executive.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_116.wav|65|Nothing would now surprise me.)
DUMMY2/p259/p259_383.wav|7|I think we'll just keep it.)
DUMMY2/p276/p276_185.wav|106|The upturn in the housing market has given a big boost.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_015.wav|24|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_119.wav|72|It's totally double standards.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_321.wav|82|They were the best team, but unlucky in the end.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_172.wav|72|Well it had to be something, that's for sure.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_158.wav|40|It's amazing, but I have never seen a drug test in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_221.wav|47|We played them off the pitch.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_392.wav|27|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_397.wav|76|Instead, it's back to the drawing board.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_378.wav|27|Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_362.wav|9|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_255.wav|7|We will try to find someone.)
DUMMY2/p234/p234_041.wav|3|I have never been a member of the council.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_003.wav|66|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_237.wav|102|This is a huge boost for my confidence.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_151.wav|16|I was on a roll.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_032.wav|73|It has failed.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_144.wav|83|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_037.wav|83|They're just different.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_119.wav|1|There will always be someone, somewhere, willing to undercut on price.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_218.wav|42|What does she consider her greatest achievement?
DUMMY2/p293/p293_127.wav|23|The Taliban response was swift.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_152.wav|40|Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_082.wav|83|I will miss him.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_280.wav|41|People have no choice.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_052.wav|98|He died from multiple injuries.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_207.wav|34|He is firm but inclusive and very fair.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_249.wav|13|The years of campaigning have been very difficult.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_292.wav|92|Anyone can still win this tournament.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_098.wav|57|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_003.wav|105|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_312.wav|107|However, there was hope, and glory too, for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_093.wav|48|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_131.wav|69|The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_107.wav|26|It is so sad.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_366.wav|1|It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_292.wav|91|He is married, with one daughter, and lives in Kent.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_163.wav|13|The president will not be removed from office.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_148.wav|19|A review of the decision is being sought.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_214.wav|27|It had all been arranged.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_204.wav|2|There was an e-mail.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_036.wav|99|It's a matter of balance.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_312.wav|54|It's up to their parents to choose.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_104.wav|3|She was there for the start of the campaign.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_374.wav|85|We said it will happen one night.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_220.wav|90|It's so special.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_045.wav|39|It seemed the tough times were behind him.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_050.wav|56|How are you, sir ?
DUMMY2/p351/p351_307.wav|33|It was all very proper and civilised.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_113.wav|53|Is there a waiting list ?
DUMMY2/p323/p323_109.wav|34|It was just another race, and yesterday is history.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_080.wav|56|It's so hard to shift.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_028.wav|75|Because we do not need it.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_278.wav|43|I feel pretty good.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_309.wav|6|Norton was delighted with his successes.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_338.wav|45|The team for the first game could be this one.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_332.wav|5|This is the last straw.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_199.wav|74|What does that mean?
DUMMY2/p364/p364_130.wav|88|The timing is wrong.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_315.wav|47|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_405.wav|42|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_089.wav|62|Here, the fans have been fantastic.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_151.wav|89|So I got a blood test.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_279.wav|33|My only concern is for my children.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_198.wav|26|They've got three-quarters of the way.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_094.wav|56|We haven't finished the complaints procedure.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_303.wav|8|The effect was almost magical.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_223.wav|22|I go home only once.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_002.wav|51|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_172.wav|104|Art is still a risky investment.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_283.wav|12|I'm going to help out in the summer, as producer.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_132.wav|64|It is just part of modern day life.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_327.wav|24|I was brought up in a mining background.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_165.wav|47|Nobody did in those days.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_231.wav|104|General, You didn't get a modified.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_337.wav|89|That has been lost.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_387.wav|18|Breaching that condition was itself an offence.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_117.wav|55|That is the only way to rate players.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_348.wav|49|It was certainly intense.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_214.wav|4|Openness is always the best way.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_029.wav|99|The main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_261.wav|36|Persuaded to change his mind.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_269.wav|41|Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_149.wav|1|I was unconscious for two or three seconds.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_268.wav|69|The record companies have gone through the floor.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_036.wav|94|A web site is planned for November.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_201.wav|70|It's all about money, money, money.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_155.wav|38|And therein lies the whole problem.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_130.wav|19|We need to make more inquiries about that.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_320.wav|76|Then came the crunch.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_139.wav|68|Subs not used, Fernandez.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_053.wav|63|How are you, sir ?
DUMMY2/p273/p273_392.wav|56|Does it matter ?
DUMMY2/p278/p278_056.wav|10|She said she was really sorry.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_408.wav|85|That is my preference.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_414.wav|97|Now we see the impact of global politics.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_307.wav|29|Size is not the issue.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_469.wav|65|If they gave me free electricity I still wouldn't support the plans.)
DUMMY2/p256/p256_090.wav|90|It was nice.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_308.wav|5|You are the glory.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_331.wav|11|SO now we know the secret.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_018.wav|24|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_388.wav|19|I was released after six days.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_265.wav|50|Do I think about them often ?
DUMMY2/p323/p323_002.wav|34|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_029.wav|32|Not if you know the person.)
DUMMY2/p262/p262_022.wav|45|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_144.wav|69|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_260.wav|99|It is also very valuable.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_343.wav|85|I was shocked and outraged.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_273.wav|20|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_198.wav|82|Edinburgh was not included in the survey.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_015.wav|103|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_216.wav|6|You are going to have to do it.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_140.wav|43|They made such decisions in London.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_111.wav|45|This film will be totally awesome.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_168.wav|43|It is too much for me.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_059.wav|90|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_060.wav|24|There's still plenty time left.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_075.wav|81|Is there a new way forward?
DUMMY2/p246/p246_329.wav|5|Who will do it?
DUMMY2/p236/p236_366.wav|75|It's as wide as a church in here.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_310.wav|104|He added, We are full of anger.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_361.wav|46|They were that poor.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_362.wav|26|We will be homeless.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_364.wav|6|Experience in this work is paramount.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_208.wav|18|It is not as simple as that.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_400.wav|4|In short, the club was broke.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_036.wav|60|I want to deliver a learning society.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_139.wav|78|And does it ?
DUMMY2/p258/p258_377.wav|26|Well, the big day has arrived.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_316.wav|55|Motherwell took them from half chances.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_103.wav|8|We needed financial backing to get it off the ground.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_060.wav|32|He hadn't had them for a long time.)
DUMMY2/p237/p237_273.wav|61|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_087.wav|6|He later told The Herald, It is true.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_004.wav|44|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_406.wav|46|I believe in God.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_140.wav|20|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_151.wav|64|He now lives in Edinburgh with his wife, Caroline.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_173.wav|98|Everything is accounted for.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_152.wav|49|The elections should have no role in this.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_238.wav|89|There wasn't a goal.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_276.wav|89|Dialogue is the key.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_266.wav|18|A spokesman refused to confirm the figure.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_108.wav|51|Harrowing is easy, after all.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_222.wav|12|It was a stunning drive from Jon.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_368.wav|1|Another suggested the company should carry only pedestrians.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_035.wav|15|His mother was English.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_073.wav|11|We're just a family working hard, working seven days a week.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_316.wav|37|That moment when the monster is being brought to life.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_018.wav|68|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_175.wav|7|US is the only country to vote against resolution.)
DUMMY2/p253/p253_289.wav|70|I was brought up in a mining background.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_157.wav|28|I felt he was excellent.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_115.wav|94|Maybe this battle has been.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_063.wav|97|I wondered about changing back to rugby.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_250.wav|61|It's quite a line-up !
DUMMY2/p341/p341_090.wav|66|The feedback from audiences was just so positive.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_200.wav|76|How do we get more people in?
DUMMY2/p226/p226_098.wav|43|If you could find it.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_215.wav|10|They make a selective perception process.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_216.wav|13|I am proud of moments like that.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_321.wav|29|I have got a victim.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_400.wav|41|It was a breathtaking moment.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_322.wav|67|It should be equal.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_424.wav|13|It's time for a change.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_284.wav|59|It is a vote of confidence in the skills in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_340.wav|41|They should take their mobile phones.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_272.wav|45|It's not even finished.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_174.wav|69|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_448.wav|100|We think a lot of Allan McGregor.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_406.wav|42|I wanted the illusion of space and depth.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_148.wav|48|People have been placed in a state of alarm.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_362.wav|31|I have got a wife to feed.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_243.wav|94|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_215.wav|84|We need to handle it.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_317.wav|73|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_315.wav|67|O Neill is caught between a rock and a hard place.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_377.wav|63|They were to blame for the first two goals.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_281.wav|84|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_347.wav|35|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_054.wav|57|It had been in place since last July.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_003.wav|24|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_262.wav|9|He's a lovely young man.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_303.wav|40|The court had a number of empty seats.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_033.wav|96|I would love it.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_374.wav|15|We all want the same things.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_172.wav|57|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_244.wav|35|Here is a question for you.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_260.wav|8|There is no change in principle from the White Paper.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_088.wav|5|Tony Blair said as little.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_111.wav|64|We have to reinforce the pressure on Iraq.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_194.wav|79|We were not consulted regarding this appointment.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_057.wav|28|You can feel at home in China.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_428.wav|63|It was a breathtaking moment.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_149.wav|39|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_277.wav|35|It is also very valuable.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_138.wav|47|He should have won.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_047.wav|90|A neighbour said.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_122.wav|8|That admission is not surprising.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_183.wav|63|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_394.wav|103|As if he were a High Court judge.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_279.wav|18|That has been lost.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_334.wav|86|However, Sharon rejected the claims.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_239.wav|37|Analysts had a mixed reaction to the numbers.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_131.wav|43|I was furious.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_319.wav|20|The problems began a long time ago.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_028.wav|62|He is doing the right things.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_339.wav|93|I saw some good things.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_184.wav|40|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_176.wav|55|You are looking at specialist staff and specialist staff cost money.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_161.wav|78|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_095.wav|39|It might change your life.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_132.wav|61|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_226.wav|39|He added that he was very sad about O Neill.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_304.wav|70|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_313.wav|19|Some of their movement was excellent.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_369.wav|74|Frankly it was disgusting.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_237.wav|101|Frankly, we were lucky to get second.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_251.wav|58|With this line-up, they didn't need to be.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_253.wav|51|Not that Agassi was a believer.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_140.wav|27|If people are genuine, then the problem is not Osama bin Laden.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_159.wav|27|Words were not required.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_294.wav|56|was everything done to save the people ?
DUMMY2/p243/p243_083.wav|53|That kind of growth is the important thing.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_149.wav|75|I was shaking on the blocks.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_014.wav|40|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_308.wav|14|We would hope to make progress on that next year.)
DUMMY2/p313/p313_300.wav|76|So what's the shape, and what's the detail?
DUMMY2/p280/p280_225.wav|52|The price was raised after massive demand from retail investors.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_020.wav|62|Many complicated ideas about the rainbows have been formed.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_250.wav|85|At the end of the day, two men have been shot.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_031.wav|86|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_323.wav|38|She now suffers from multiple sclerosis.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_452.wav|100|But we have built a platform for next season.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_138.wav|98|They are declining elsewhere in the UK.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_172.wav|81|It is not either national standards or local control.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_351.wav|20|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_303.wav|51|He is also a great finisher.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_222.wav|45|Clearly, the stakes are high.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_023.wav|81|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_266.wav|52|The full Cabinet will meet today to discuss the oil crisis.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_404.wav|33|It should be a great game, though.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_005.wav|92|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_271.wav|55|This was the perfect setting.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_037.wav|56|Every aspect of our play was first class.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_076.wav|89|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
DUMMY2/p317/p317_376.wav|97|I think it was briefly considered.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_338.wav|81|Finally, he paid for the movie.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_257.wav|39|The irony was not lost.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_082.wav|76|This does not help.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_092.wav|6|It was the turning point of the afternoon.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_372.wav|60|Frankly, that's not good enough.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_023.wav|73|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_238.wav|82|Lockerbie has been a terrible disaster for everyone.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_246.wav|79|We want to see the maximum of change.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_377.wav|25|We have to reduce the number of plastic bags.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_326.wav|82|I was waiting for that question.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_008.wav|74|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_022.wav|21|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_003.wav|8|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_296.wav|105|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_039.wav|40|Indeed, he does.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_236.wav|25|They should come forward.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_139.wav|30|The singer's condition was not specified.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_286.wav|31|The death toll included five children.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_349.wav|29|I came into this world with nothing.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_380.wav|49|Even though the show is seriously exacting, physically demanding.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_067.wav|92|And he listens to his artists as well.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_116.wav|7|The result is a vacuum.)
DUMMY2/p281/p281_117.wav|36|I've heard this stuff about the markets.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_171.wav|2|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_209.wav|96|There was an e-mail.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_047.wav|44|It was an easy decision to come here.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_282.wav|102|That was merely their initial problem.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_225.wav|47|I'd never seen a play about me.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_115.wav|50|January is a bad time of year.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_251.wav|55|Perhaps it will happen again.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_068.wav|41|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_311.wav|8|The world record is suspicious.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_099.wav|99|That's all right then.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_391.wav|17|Have you heard anything from Paramount?
DUMMY2/p231/p231_136.wav|50|He is a great addition to our team.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_181.wav|92|The Prime Minister was informed on Thursday.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_411.wav|75|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_297.wav|70|Eight new hospitals are set to be built.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_293.wav|14|I understand the security issue.)
DUMMY2/p261/p261_042.wav|100|That's been the difference between the sides.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_004.wav|64|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_019.wav|88|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_261.wav|53|Every player goes through this after a serious injury.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_277.wav|68|Last year, however, was a different story.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_393.wav|38|A world away from Rangers, you might say.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_195.wav|37|This Patton will also return.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_309.wav|65|Five years ago its return was rejected.)
DUMMY2/p294/p294_003.wav|104|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_163.wav|105|I've put my own money into this project.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_256.wav|13|This is too much like Scotland.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_298.wav|105|This is the culture change in medicine.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_096.wav|29|No, the equipment is extra.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_365.wav|16|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_330.wav|85|But we will not be scared.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_151.wav|86|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_196.wav|6|A decision is expected tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_060.wav|9|It is not great art.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_240.wav|67|We are so proud.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_068.wav|73|The results are tragic.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_039.wav|32|Merger would be entirely logical.)
DUMMY2/p252/p252_225.wav|55|Now the door has opened.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_312.wav|90|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_391.wav|105|This is a huge confidence boost.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_289.wav|58|But, mainly, it is up to ourselves.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_327.wav|23|Life is too short.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_003.wav|87|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_107.wav|105|They will want to perform well.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_284.wav|34|Is it a threat to union?
DUMMY2/p333/p333_051.wav|64|And does it even matter?
DUMMY2/p310/p310_308.wav|17|In all cases computer equipment was seized.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_417.wav|49|THE pain was almost too much to bear.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_296.wav|54|I'm quite embarrassed and ashamed of doing that.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_184.wav|9|What has caused the demise of singing?
DUMMY2/p341/p341_141.wav|66|A teacher is, really, about unity.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_191.wav|32|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.)
DUMMY2/p295/p295_414.wav|92|How do we get more people in?
DUMMY2/p295/p295_200.wav|92|It is not attempting to offer a solution.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_269.wav|10|We accept the new rules.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_097.wav|96|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_138.wav|82|I was on my own.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_102.wav|78|He liked the weather, the courses, the food.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_240.wav|65|This is a big game for both of us.)
DUMMY2/p229/p229_089.wav|67|It is a lifeline.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_266.wav|58|Their three other children had died as infants.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_300.wav|105|They were fantastic.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_410.wav|70|Is there any prospect of this happening?
DUMMY2/p361/p361_376.wav|79|Because they didn't want to know.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_041.wav|52|Hearts hit back with two goals in four minutes.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_036.wav|106|A fiver and I'll tell.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_289.wav|17|He must have something up his sleeve.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_403.wav|77|We have to reinforce the pressure on Iraq.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_106.wav|60|Consumers will also benefit.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_034.wav|5|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_115.wav|39|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_271.wav|22|Bombing is the easy option.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_057.wav|40|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_140.wav|73|The amount of energy in a tornado is enormous.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_294.wav|93|Maloney is an engaging talent.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_143.wav|37|But it looks good for next year.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_021.wav|103|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_119.wav|24|No, the equipment is extra.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_332.wav|106|You were an easy target and therefore an easy sacrifice.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_228.wav|105|It is set in Paris.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_348.wav|29|In the old days, it was easy.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_080.wav|22|Ferguson did not hesitate.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_025.wav|46|A crucial moment has arrived.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_249.wav|33|It has become a way of life.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_227.wav|55|Her death is a huge blow.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_070.wav|45|Then followed a bout of flu.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_035.wav|103|Mr King, who was present at yesterday's hearing, refused to comment.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_012.wav|39|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_292.wav|61|They seem to get away with it.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_268.wav|8|He took over our lives.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_116.wav|32|Which can happen any time.)
DUMMY2/p272/p272_085.wav|69|Even the one she loved.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_360.wav|67|It was very formal.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_273.wav|83|She looked so young.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_257.wav|94|Special measures were needed.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_364.wav|89|So there, we won.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_038.wav|29|She hopes to study in Britain one day.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_294.wav|41|These figures are truly awful.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_462.wav|48|She failed in her action.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_175.wav|97|They are difficult awards to decide.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_155.wav|35|It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_292.wav|59|He has retired.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_091.wav|35|The conclusion is the same.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_141.wav|93|Wallace was a prisoner of war.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_337.wav|17|I have found my vision.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_090.wav|13|We should be capable of managing it, though.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_331.wav|8|It will set the tone.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_113.wav|65|Firm action must be taken.)
DUMMY2/p244/p244_186.wav|78|The feeling is hard to describe.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_225.wav|35|The Prime Minister was informed on Thursday.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_430.wav|7|The next few months will tell.)
DUMMY2/p229/p229_053.wav|67|A recording contract is on the horizon.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_030.wav|67|It's easy to talk about these things in the abstract.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_013.wav|33|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_221.wav|71|"My wife and family are the support system."
DUMMY2/p241/p241_209.wav|86|But I am a worried man.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_027.wav|6|It was actually very, very difficult.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_365.wav|13|And does it even matter?
DUMMY2/p308/p308_096.wav|107|Craig is still suffering seizures.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_391.wav|89|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_127.wav|26|Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_224.wav|76|There is no margin for error.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_141.wav|105|I feel very grateful with everything.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_292.wav|100|It would create a Scottish secretary with a lot of weight.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_207.wav|17|Who is going to be penalised?
DUMMY2/p310/p310_136.wav|17|He is dying from cancer.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_079.wav|75|On Saturday, it was much the same.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_223.wav|3|He must have a crack at it.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_327.wav|84|It added to the spectacle.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_474.wav|50|The casting of her husband was an accident.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_118.wav|59|He has been under great pressure.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_264.wav|36|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_248.wav|0|It might be sad, but it's a fact.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_075.wav|45|What has changed?
DUMMY2/p374/p374_221.wav|11|Not so, he insisted.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_321.wav|6|It was blown out of proportion.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_371.wav|76|I see it as my job.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_271.wav|43|He was popular.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_135.wav|100|The others have all been in storage for some time.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_235.wav|10|The City welcomed the brighter outlook.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_417.wav|11|Some old favourites remain in varying forms.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_017.wav|52|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_170.wav|3|Details will be published in The Herald in the coming weeks.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_276.wav|93|Lottery money was intended to be used for good causes.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_367.wav|103|So what does one do?
DUMMY2/p286/p286_187.wav|63|Each case is treated on merit.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_330.wav|61|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_229.wav|15|We have nowhere to go.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_431.wav|14|No date has been fixed for his return.)
DUMMY2/p374/p374_076.wav|11|What method of funding is being used?
DUMMY2/p362/p362_065.wav|15|She had no chance.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_145.wav|65|The truth will come out.)
DUMMY2/p340/p340_252.wav|74|They set up to win the hole.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_285.wav|102|I need them to set my career.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_294.wav|77|If not, he should go home.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_033.wav|17|Mr King, who was present at yesterday's hearing, refused to comment.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_130.wav|40|Twaddle is a case in point.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_314.wav|42|And he is immensely loyal.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_021.wav|86|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_093.wav|61|We must look forward.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_102.wav|45|It was an adventure.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_024.wav|14|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.)
DUMMY2/p347/p347_170.wav|46|She could easily have been killed.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_407.wav|27|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_392.wav|8|I always knew she was funny.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_363.wav|11|But when we do it is great.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_168.wav|17|And then came the seventies.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_102.wav|51|The proposal was rejected.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_230.wav|47|She hopes to study in Britain one day.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_223.wav|55|Brian was last to join.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_126.wav|62|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_071.wav|94|It's a winner.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_353.wav|19|He was made redundant in February last year.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_189.wav|38|This is not a struggle against Islam.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_363.wav|67|It benefits the whole family.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_115.wav|74|I have never been in anything like that.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_056.wav|62|My only concern is for my children.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_030.wav|79|We must convince the citizens.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_061.wav|95|Do I have a favourite ?
DUMMY2/p305/p305_373.wav|54|The company has other problems with the shells.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_308.wav|73|Either team will be hard.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_400.wav|75|It certainly appeared that way.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_069.wav|60|It was that kind of afternoon.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_404.wav|11|Well, you can't have everything.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_330.wav|9|It is out there.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_170.wav|72|They would have looked out for each other.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_194.wav|3|It would make a lot of sense.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_314.wav|51|We are waiting for them to calm down.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_165.wav|105|I lost my head.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_405.wav|77|It's too close to call.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_078.wav|97|It's been a terrible ordeal for Margaret.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_333.wav|17|The South African defended his work ethic.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_145.wav|36|The FBI could become involved.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_020.wav|57|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_029.wav|28|We have got to attack.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_077.wav|75|By then, he was walking on water.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_048.wav|39|Hopefully, it will be built by next year.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_383.wav|38|The attacker has been put in foster care.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_079.wav|98|I might have been sitting at home, with her out here.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_388.wav|95|They were to blame for the first two goals.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_280.wav|29|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_150.wav|69|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_352.wav|37|So what is the campaign about ?
DUMMY2/p284/p284_028.wav|16|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_079.wav|14|Both men were on one-year contracts.)
DUMMY2/p273/p273_288.wav|56|The circumstances have changed since last year.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_209.wav|20|I was so nervous.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_404.wav|77|No, because it was too many.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_215.wav|19|Bill Clinton always had an idea to sell.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_369.wav|18|The night is young.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_349.wav|83|The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_128.wav|100|I have accepted the challenge.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_033.wav|71|"Because we do not need it."
DUMMY2/p277/p277_133.wav|89|The BBC was a disgrace.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_338.wav|10|The letters are going out today.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_360.wav|14|It's wonderful to have won.)
DUMMY2/p248/p248_133.wav|99|It plans to return to this field.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_170.wav|66|We must not give in to bastards.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_461.wav|65|In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.)
DUMMY2/p339/p339_303.wav|18|That is not good for golf!
DUMMY2/p274/p274_259.wav|32|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.)
DUMMY2/p306/p306_242.wav|12|They were two different types.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_290.wav|28|Well, was it?
DUMMY2/p251/p251_259.wav|9|They tried to give her advice.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_011.wav|69|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_340.wav|46|The winner will be announced by early summer.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_206.wav|82|Then another one came.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_304.wav|60|We will not tolerate it.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_418.wav|95|That's all I can say.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_125.wav|11|It's up to them.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_236.wav|76|Home is in the Scottish Borders.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_168.wav|104|Genetic assessment is crucial.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_025.wav|63|Smoking is also very important.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_454.wav|14|Police have appealed for witnesses.)
DUMMY2/p259/p259_025.wav|7|But it could prove disastrous.)
DUMMY2/p294/p294_355.wav|104|The support of Britain is assumed.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_128.wav|51|Police were also perplexed.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_033.wav|9|Peace was won.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_220.wav|21|I didn't actually work up a speech.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_157.wav|93|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_388.wav|66|Such people do not exist.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_231.wav|81|But it's a subtle process.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_325.wav|31|It is a strong case.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_378.wav|26|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_365.wav|87|There was an element of frustration.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_414.wav|106|No plans for projects are yet in place.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_262.wav|72|I believe that Scotland has much to gain.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_228.wav|91|More money for students would help - in an ideal world.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_222.wav|87|Arnie ignores the suggestion that he has ever been anywhere else.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_081.wav|44|It is, in other words, Entrapment by another name.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_003.wav|22|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_123.wav|2|It is not a U-turn.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_365.wav|83|By that time, however, it was already too late.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_222.wav|65|The two companies were not for sale.)
DUMMY2/p299/p299_210.wav|58|I just could not cope.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_256.wav|94|It is nearly there.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_341.wav|45|His views are hardly surprising.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_026.wav|8|They will not be allowed to succeed.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_402.wav|2|The orchestra was already increasing the scope of its ambitions.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_014.wav|75|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_108.wav|64|Clark is back on top form.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_006.wav|105|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_264.wav|68|Our idea is to make it entirely Irish.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_161.wav|80|There's a pause.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_160.wav|93|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_069.wav|53|I cannot believe that someone would pay so much for works like these.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_301.wav|2|This is a war over our home.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_361.wav|4|The actors are confident and polished.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_171.wav|105|There was no hint of scandal.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_238.wav|60|This is a historic occasion.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_047.wav|78|The whole thing is the music.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_102.wav|14|But it is up again.)
DUMMY2/p260/p260_218.wav|81|It's not before time.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_106.wav|6|He had never run the distance before.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_071.wav|34|The law has got to be upheld.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_142.wav|14|I learned that only yesterday.)
DUMMY2/p295/p295_311.wav|92|It felt like my support system was leaving.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_139.wav|103|And that was the adults.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_029.wav|52|The Budget is a boost for Scottish business.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_037.wav|79|This decision is folly.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_297.wav|85|Which brings us to the point.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_218.wav|106|how do you get it back ?
DUMMY2/p374/p374_173.wav|11|The rest is his own.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_071.wav|1|It is also very valuable.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_378.wav|28|But sometimes it works out all right.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_372.wav|97|It broke up my marriage.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_004.wav|74|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_038.wav|100|This represents a tough game for us.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_374.wav|6|There is nothing to fear.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_238.wav|38|I never wanted a legal battle.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_045.wav|27|Among them are many criminals.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_130.wav|35|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_305.wav|40|The plot is minimal.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_355.wav|8|It's wonderful to have won.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_312.wav|80|I will not allow the destruction of the Scottish fishing industry.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_325.wav|72|I hope he has learned from it.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_109.wav|63|They must be on commission.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_035.wav|51|Well, what do you know?
DUMMY2/p360/p360_338.wav|60|But this is nonsense.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_416.wav|11|That clearly wasn't what they wanted.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_036.wav|68|Nor does it have a stock of medicines.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_420.wav|4|We will listen to colleagues.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_400.wav|33|You find it bizarre?
DUMMY2/p335/p335_021.wav|49|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_225.wav|16|We were awful.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_164.wav|12|I do my job.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_412.wav|33|Everything else is second.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_083.wav|10|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_261.wav|63|And it was this one.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_048.wav|99|Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_041.wav|39|It could well be the case.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_068.wav|27|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_297.wav|55|He also worked on general building contracts in the area.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_315.wav|24|It's all designed to speed up the service.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_186.wav|73|It was very frightened and dirty.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_255.wav|87|Their extinction is not inevitable.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_221.wav|74|He was also a great man.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_313.wav|73|Finally, he paid for the movie.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_209.wav|74|Hollywood comedy is having a good week.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_195.wav|93|I am totally surprised.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_237.wav|8|That was a real challenge.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_188.wav|23|But Allen is deadly serious.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_214.wav|60|It was one of those things.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_229.wav|77|She died in middle age.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_030.wav|9|So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_220.wav|77|The red card was okay.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_242.wav|68|Alcohol, of course, is strictly forbidden in Iran.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_084.wav|22|It was published yesterday on the internet.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_229.wav|88|Everything is surrounded by confusion.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_123.wav|106|Petrol prices were widely blamed.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_096.wav|97|One season, they might do well.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_325.wav|5|It shows a great deal to come back under that mental pressure.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_230.wav|93|It's so special.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_283.wav|85|There are no quick fixes.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_385.wav|97|But he has strong links to Labour.
