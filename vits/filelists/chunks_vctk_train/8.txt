DUMMY2/p248/p248_162.wav|99|It has to be now.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_383.wav|92|Our proposals are fully costed.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_097.wav|20|I saw the whole thing.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_347.wav|48|And the World Cup has not even begun.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_120.wav|43|It would not do any harm to reinforce the message.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_269.wav|80|And Michael was just great.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_218.wav|76|It's not a wish list.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_087.wav|26|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_251.wav|65|I hit you there.)
DUMMY2/p234/p234_245.wav|3|Do I think about them often ?
DUMMY2/p304/p304_395.wav|72|It was better than a soap opera.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_194.wav|105|He has a lot of experience as captain in his career.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_270.wav|35|I was ready for this.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_254.wav|102|People would say, He thinks he can do that as well.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_345.wav|9|You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_210.wav|23|The investment programme will deliver these improvements.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_112.wav|76|A web site is planned for November.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_256.wav|46|THE headless man has finally developed a face.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_185.wav|49|He had come of age.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_067.wav|1|We gave everything we had.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_162.wav|3|In that case, the children were not missing.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_049.wav|95|No details of the talks were given.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_070.wav|76|I'm confident of the outcome this week.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_322.wav|60|It has been only average.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_180.wav|95|They should stop the bombing.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_320.wav|17|On Saturday, it was much the same.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_274.wav|2|I feel pretty good.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_275.wav|91|I'd say we should give it a week.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_145.wav|104|However, there are no plans for injecting rooms.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_230.wav|97|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_341.wav|95|This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_299.wav|49|He said he was sorry.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_377.wav|70|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_356.wav|56|I was delighted to accept.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_251.wav|36|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_416.wav|4|The whole process was so different.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_193.wav|73|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_308.wav|27|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_270.wav|28|Subs not used, McGraw.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_368.wav|106|I had relied on him.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_247.wav|104|Everything else is the same.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_077.wav|18|That should be fun.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_318.wav|43|Kids are terrible.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_361.wav|75|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_310.wav|12|There are no easy solutions to this problem.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_257.wav|36|She took them for a term.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_219.wav|29|They make a selective perception process.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_402.wav|27|He will be judged by his actions.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_269.wav|20|We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_217.wav|31|I had relied on him.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_446.wav|32|It wouldn't matter if he had.)
DUMMY2/p360/p360_303.wav|60|They were not at the property yesterday.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_276.wav|75|We accept the new rules.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_262.wav|82|But this is different.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_237.wav|54|You see, it wasn't a tournament of equals.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_106.wav|42|And if he hadn't become a musician?
DUMMY2/p280/p280_321.wav|52|This term they are second bottom with three games left to play.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_104.wav|72|Four people died instantly.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_159.wav|64|I cannot believe she has been admonished.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_128.wav|42|It was my shortest audition.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_391.wav|41|Perhaps the time has come to put the cup in a museum.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_011.wav|58|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he's looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_371.wav|58|The plane was in flames
DUMMY2/p293/p293_373.wav|23|But it was to no avail.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_132.wav|104|I'm deeply sorry they did.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_255.wav|8|This championship is different from the other majors.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_211.wav|103|But he's not afraid to take risks.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_080.wav|6|All the time, that number was coming down and down.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_178.wav|84|Waiting times for these services are too long.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_283.wav|71|"It happens from time to time."
DUMMY2/p245/p245_182.wav|59|The red card was okay.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_252.wav|34|The Labour Party's not downbeat, and neither is the Labour Government.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_344.wav|57|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_136.wav|45|That group reported just before Christmas.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_033.wav|105|I came to complete.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_018.wav|87|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_096.wav|78|He is in the US.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_099.wav|0|We need to handle it.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_113.wav|57|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_134.wav|8|So what happens next ?
DUMMY2/p229/p229_009.wav|67|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_267.wav|12|After day one back, he may be revising that opinion already.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_314.wav|34|Volvo is grateful to its staff in Irvine.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_324.wav|74|Will they fall in love?
DUMMY2/p361/p361_142.wav|79|Until you hit the big games.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_095.wav|70|Yet, it worked.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_326.wav|60|Eight new hospitals are set to be built.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_070.wav|98|Sadly, in this case, that was not so.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_053.wav|39|He will need that machine.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_084.wav|35|You are a great player.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_379.wav|7|It has to solve the nuclear waste disposal problem.)
DUMMY2/p276/p276_423.wav|106|You didn't need to pay.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_074.wav|40|The party is up for it.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_222.wav|30|It was a total surprise.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_375.wav|56|This hasn't happened in a vacuum.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_094.wav|57|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_134.wav|63|It was a good game to watch.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_114.wav|28|Thousands of others have not been so fortunate.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_229.wav|58|I think he has undergone a sea change.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_165.wav|41|I have got a wife to feed.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_055.wav|76|Her role in it was small.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_129.wav|59|That group reported just before Christmas.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_316.wav|48|I think, therefore I am ?
DUMMY2/p339/p339_251.wav|18|Police are appealing for witnesses.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_178.wav|74|We can't determine that clearly.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_234.wav|52|The labour side has developed in the North area.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_096.wav|67|The main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_116.wav|59|I do not think this family will ever get over this.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_349.wav|60|Where did that finish?
DUMMY2/p347/p347_001.wav|46|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_038.wav|82|I'd rather be singing Verdi.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_138.wav|31|It's a question of fashion.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_084.wav|86|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_488.wav|24|The Israeli military denied the claim.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_113.wav|93|This film will be totally awesome.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_035.wav|63|Mr Darling yesterday dismissed the criticism.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_349.wav|101|How do you take them away ?
DUMMY2/p316/p316_271.wav|85|She was so full of life.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_080.wav|16|Who will pay for this?
DUMMY2/p374/p374_250.wav|11|The members have clearly spoken.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_408.wav|38|It remains in public ownership.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_153.wav|50|He was asked to quit.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_117.wav|87|Those people must be accountable.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_011.wav|38|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_315.wav|6|The Old Firm are growing.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_157.wav|35|They will do their own thing.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_306.wav|20|I can give no comment.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_025.wav|31|He has not been named.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_373.wav|48|He is obviously very dangerous.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_323.wav|63|We need to increase the membership.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_274.wav|71|"It is not a process which can be completed overnight."
DUMMY2/p311/p311_175.wav|4|His only reply was a laugh.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_187.wav|28|This is your country.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_158.wav|79|Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_390.wav|2|I love the thought of having a crack at defending the title.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_176.wav|76|It is very much a matter for them.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_322.wav|102|Technically, it was a very good performance by Scotland.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_107.wav|73|You had better believe it.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_154.wav|67|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_405.wav|52|I'd never seen a play about me.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_258.wav|24|Customers would then be consulted over any changes.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_162.wav|11|You probably have never seen them before.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_254.wav|103|He also presented You Bet!
DUMMY2/p362/p362_360.wav|15|I am feeling on top of the world.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_183.wav|64|The same goes for personnel.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_413.wav|1|Their welfare is very important to us.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_136.wav|85|While they went on a holiday, we got the contract.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_250.wav|82|It's too much work.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_114.wav|76|I was very fortunate.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_128.wav|72|That is my role.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_375.wav|70|That's the name of the game, though.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_286.wav|45|The attacker died in the crash.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_178.wav|53|Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_318.wav|65|I just felt like a dead loss.)
DUMMY2/p281/p281_410.wav|36|That was a touch of class.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_186.wav|65|She runs like her mother.)
DUMMY2/p360/p360_206.wav|60|No-one has used it since then.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_392.wav|25|I never won a penny throughout my career.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_354.wav|38|Ferguson should take note.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_017.wav|6|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_141.wav|1|No Briton has ever won.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_030.wav|48|It is about control of our economy.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_201.wav|24|It may have been a cry for help.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_112.wav|19|A web site is planned for November.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_177.wav|95|There is no reason at all.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_277.wav|20|He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_323.wav|23|That's just the kind of thing we have.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_185.wav|61|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_110.wav|100|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_056.wav|8|After the match, do you ?
DUMMY2/p305/p305_265.wav|54|Our offer will remain on the table.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_185.wav|70|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_319.wav|107|I'm getting back up there now.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_228.wav|59|This fact is supported by audience research.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_428.wav|37|Messages have to be reinforced.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_104.wav|46|Safety was also an issue.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_293.wav|51|I am just trying to do my job.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_365.wav|97|He would help me with the form.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_052.wav|38|It is a form of physical exercise.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_089.wav|53|I feel I did not have enough time.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_360.wav|26|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_126.wav|16|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_171.wav|98|However, they should not come as a surprise.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_020.wav|16|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_262.wav|31|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_040.wav|64|It is time for a new approach.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_131.wav|92|Obviously, people are worried in the West Midlands.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_078.wav|26|Nothing is yet confirmed.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_136.wav|8|But beyond a fairly minimal level it has little impact.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_250.wav|27|It is hard won.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_191.wav|10|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_309.wav|24|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_255.wav|40|Is that a serious question?
DUMMY2/p236/p236_058.wav|75|You should consider whether you want to be in this film.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_233.wav|35|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_128.wav|14|He is particularly happy with the size of the gallery.)
DUMMY2/p240/p240_127.wav|93|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_039.wav|69|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_447.wav|32|No further details of expansion plans were given.)
DUMMY2/p281/p281_222.wav|36|What are you not good at ?
DUMMY2/p276/p276_238.wav|106|Had this been common practice ?
DUMMY2/p260/p260_352.wav|81|They should take their mobile phones.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_290.wav|37|We've just had it confirmed.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_322.wav|18|You'll have to wait and see.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_008.wav|62|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_235.wav|105|My future is in the marathon.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_038.wav|68|It was a crucial moment.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_124.wav|9|It's terrible that he has died the same way.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_269.wav|64|It was very frightened and dirty.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_359.wav|36|He had no previous convictions.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_234.wav|44|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_394.wav|46|I took a minibus into town.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_116.wav|5|Who would have?
DUMMY2/p268/p268_206.wav|87|We believe a third party was involved.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_113.wav|21|The odds are that it will.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_157.wav|10|Donald Dewar was passionate about his politics.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_228.wav|79|But they have taken the lesson to heart.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_110.wav|7|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.)
DUMMY2/p310/p310_322.wav|17|But we were wrong.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_286.wav|104|It didn't work against Sweden, but that was the intention.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_057.wav|99|Next league matches Celtic.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_069.wav|33|The working families tax credit is far better.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_442.wav|63|It is never easy to win an Olympic gold medal.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_016.wav|14|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. )
DUMMY2/p274/p274_126.wav|32|Why change it ?)
DUMMY2/p307/p307_319.wav|22|EMI is a prime example.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_228.wav|104|I could not believe what they were saying.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_352.wav|79|The duties are still to be drawn up.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_142.wav|86|He is severe.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_063.wav|47|Equity declined to comment.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_146.wav|70|Who would have?
DUMMY2/p284/p284_215.wav|16|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_155.wav|13|That takes time and games and practice.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_266.wav|97|There were no proposals on the table.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_234.wav|22|Hopefully, it will pay off for me.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_064.wav|83|That's the truth.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_361.wav|28|However, BBC Scotland was not interested in his work.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_095.wav|59|Oil embargo endorsed.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_378.wav|20|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_165.wav|66|Most of the public are behind me.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_409.wav|8|Colour was at the core of his life.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_076.wav|68|It will be very useful for us.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_099.wav|44|Their vision was not impeded.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_294.wav|51|I don't think we could have expected better.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_207.wav|39|It is not easy to live in Russia.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_352.wav|104|They are not falling now.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_356.wav|78|However, it does not tell the full story.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_044.wav|10|He looks like an Afghan.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_198.wav|2|The service from the other players was super.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_427.wav|50|I would love to think that she could win.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_129.wav|89|She really suffered for her art.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_250.wav|76|The bottom line is that this must stop.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_112.wav|32|It's not a quick fix.)
DUMMY2/p230/p230_154.wav|35|It has to be now.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_216.wav|90|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_291.wav|107|His is a success story by any standard.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_307.wav|57|The problems began a long time ago.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_293.wav|35|I would rather look at him.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_087.wav|93|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_068.wav|99|It's good news and long overdue.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_439.wav|100|I'm looking for work in Bath and back home in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_080.wav|33|I don't understand it.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_102.wav|57|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_395.wav|62|This isn't something the Labour Government has invented.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_189.wav|95|Nobody did in those days.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_342.wav|54|And we still have to pay his salary.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_278.wav|13|It has been only average.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_014.wav|23|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_418.wav|72|We would all have liked to run.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_183.wav|59|I have a cold.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_258.wav|46|I am a little bit tired.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_202.wav|100|We believe a third party was involved.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_413.wav|106|Subs not used, McKenzie, Ritchie.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_051.wav|61|That should do it.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_415.wav|6|I am happy with my form.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_163.wav|89|It is so unfair.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_086.wav|27|Someone who cares
DUMMY2/p308/p308_318.wav|107|So, the question is, is it any good?
DUMMY2/p299/p299_348.wav|58|They are just bewildered and very concerned.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_187.wav|18|This could be wonderful.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_109.wav|107|Or so it would appear.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_224.wav|17|Some of his family still live there.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_180.wav|105|It is minute.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_154.wav|11|Next league matches Motherwell.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_248.wav|3|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_187.wav|31|Tony had arrived.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_244.wav|62|I won't go back.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_303.wav|89|He is also keen to win the European order of merit.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_049.wav|51|All the oil companies are talking together.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_022.wav|84|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_031.wav|102|I don't believe you own anything.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_037.wav|101|In fact, they are the future of investment.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_152.wav|84|It is like a football team.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_414.wav|78|In order to get there, we have got to invest.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_105.wav|91|Is your life a little too easy?
DUMMY2/p257/p257_202.wav|105|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_053.wav|4|We will miss him very much.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_269.wav|54|If you could have dinner with anyone, who would it be?
DUMMY2/p360/p360_059.wav|60|The incidents are not believed to be linked.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_368.wav|46|I'm really proud of my young players.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_301.wav|57|We have waited a long time for this.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_213.wav|57|Yet she is still the woman behind the famous man.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_347.wav|21|That will just be the beginning.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_269.wav|65|Others get through it.)
DUMMY2/p298/p298_358.wav|68|They were on holiday in Egypt.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_069.wav|15|It's more relaxing this way.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_128.wav|93|Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_463.wav|100|Let that be their memorial.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_008.wav|60|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_127.wav|5|It plans to return to this field.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_163.wav|100|You had to go and see him.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_248.wav|34|These are exciting times for young Scottish players.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_013.wav|34|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_109.wav|86|You had better believe it.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_082.wav|80|It is a job creation scheme.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_158.wav|69|We are on a four-year mission.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_290.wav|88|I have been here for only three months.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_201.wav|102|The talking is going on, but the Iraqi people will survive.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_155.wav|79|I wish they would commit to us.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_325.wav|74|There was nothing sinister in that.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_026.wav|87|He got very close tonight.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_393.wav|76|This is the last thing we ever expected.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_113.wav|5|Who would be a referee?
DUMMY2/p326/p326_304.wav|28|It makes a huge difference.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_092.wav|102|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_357.wav|26|It was very formal.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_047.wav|98|There can be no dispute about our history.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_373.wav|91|And the reason isn't too hard to fathom.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_081.wav|45|Someone who cares
DUMMY2/p288/p288_285.wav|47|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_310.wav|101|What are they for ?
DUMMY2/p232/p232_041.wav|96|I suspect the latter.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_022.wav|4|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_327.wav|35|We have a good healthy debate.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_259.wav|88|That's the last thing he will do.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_243.wav|72|There is no pressure from anyone now.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_118.wav|75|Three hours later, the man was free.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_098.wav|27|It is annoying.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_372.wav|38|Playing in Europe is the benchmark.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_261.wav|48|Boats and other equipment would be pooled.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_198.wav|41|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_382.wav|47|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_120.wav|0|You've got to be vigilant.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_165.wav|65|It's been my life.)
DUMMY2/p245/p245_146.wav|59|I was in the train station overnight.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_157.wav|1|But it could have been written for her.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_158.wav|10|These days are long gone.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_330.wav|29|There's still a bit to go.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_252.wav|7|Corporate banking would be based in Edinburgh.)
DUMMY2/p341/p341_158.wav|66|But my heart is in athletics.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_409.wav|36|Yet the data is compelling.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_333.wav|65|That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.)
DUMMY2/p335/p335_416.wav|49|They will run in tandem with New Work.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_317.wav|87|Life has changed for rugby players in just three years.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_123.wav|33|Last night he became one of the hunted.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_161.wav|38|The investment will be in the food.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_149.wav|52|Is it in the right place ?
DUMMY2/p269/p269_273.wav|94|It left me with a sadness.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_186.wav|100|They need to look after themselves.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_333.wav|37|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_107.wav|76|Pitt, of course, would play the lead singer.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_245.wav|53|What are you not good at ?
DUMMY2/p262/p262_200.wav|45|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_130.wav|47|If people are genuine, then the problem is not Osama bin Laden.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_061.wav|72|Trading Places was too obvious.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_262.wav|2|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_411.wav|95|Thankfully, Peter had already found another outlet for his talents.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_378.wav|69|That's the name of the game, though.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_318.wav|14|The weather will be unpredictable if anything.)
DUMMY2/p258/p258_083.wav|26|Today I couldn't run on it.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_288.wav|70|I was the sheep.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_133.wav|84|It's an amazing landscape!
DUMMY2/p267/p267_058.wav|0|It's just the timing of the game.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_187.wav|47|We have to recognise that he is an elusive character.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_014.wav|81|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_313.wav|104|We work for the athlete.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_270.wav|56|Internet users will double over the next three years in the UK.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_255.wav|54|He will be sentenced tomorrow by Lord Dawson.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_003.wav|10|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_362.wav|67|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_421.wav|15|I want to help other women.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_128.wav|3|The end result is the same.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_366.wav|13|My parents are exhausted.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_143.wav|50|Anyone can do the sums.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_098.wav|71|"We live by the rule of law."
DUMMY2/p341/p341_167.wav|66|It really is a gift to the world.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_414.wav|104|Would it really be good to shorten it?
DUMMY2/p297/p297_197.wav|42|Blood samples were taken.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_115.wav|20|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_381.wav|66|They have learned from that.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_200.wav|86|The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_221.wav|9|A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_137.wav|12|One of them, a woman, is in serious condition.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_181.wav|107|Again, this was genuine loyalty being recognised.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_261.wav|47|We shall rely on human beings.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_090.wav|104|He had just returned from a run.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_041.wav|22|It doesn't make them evil.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_006.wav|99|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_302.wav|66|But it was for charity, just a bit of fun.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_211.wav|32|They have known the hard times.)
DUMMY2/p244/p244_052.wav|78|The pressure on the players will build.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_118.wav|78|Otherwise, the market may come back.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_417.wav|95|The second goal was superb.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_377.wav|50|In due course the deal was done.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_123.wav|47|The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_179.wav|9|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_040.wav|60|It's not been a good year.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_465.wav|100|She would take the Farmer to the opera.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_084.wav|101|He is delighted, and he has every right to be.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_111.wav|32|You can spend money on housing.)
DUMMY2/p298/p298_234.wav|68|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_323.wav|57|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_113.wav|34|I have played really well all year.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_149.wav|78|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_292.wav|49|There are so many people to thank.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_170.wav|64|They won the trophy in the Hoops.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_122.wav|27|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_146.wav|52|Look, George W Bush will come here in two months.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_242.wav|39|She will attend in July.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_109.wav|4|Just watch the videos and you'll see it.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_222.wav|95|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_171.wav|4|I've thought a lot about the Commonwealths.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_117.wav|61|This is a scheme that has a lot of potential.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_069.wav|25|Art is extra.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_253.wav|65|He is keen to stay in public service.)
DUMMY2/p259/p259_331.wav|7|Are they free ?)
DUMMY2/p310/p310_044.wav|17|Normally, they have been a pack of lies.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_017.wav|51|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_417.wav|24|It became a national network.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_030.wav|70|This is the window.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_275.wav|106|Is it in the right place ?
DUMMY2/p299/p299_320.wav|58|I think in three dimensions.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_385.wav|6|Does it really matter?
DUMMY2/p251/p251_205.wav|9|They've got three-quarters of the way.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_359.wav|33|He was, but only just.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_113.wav|8|IT HAS been the year of the youngster at Kilmarnock.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_096.wav|4|Surely history will not repeat itself.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_278.wav|90|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_144.wav|57|She hopes to study in Britain one day.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_250.wav|30|And also, whatever he does, can he really win?
DUMMY2/p310/p310_060.wav|17|She has a wonderful mind.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_247.wav|70|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_460.wav|14|The boys are mentally focused.)
DUMMY2/p243/p243_128.wav|53|We have to offer value for money.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_296.wav|67|Sunday's game was not a trial.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_084.wav|90|It is a matter of the utmost concern to the Allies.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_310.wav|49|I am not among its admirers.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_194.wav|97|That option cannot be ruled out.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_177.wav|96|Blair's response was weak.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_330.wav|2|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_080.wav|41|Painful, but only because it's true.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_411.wav|97|This wasn't something we wanted to rush into.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_091.wav|93|Today I couldn't run on it.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_355.wav|13|That didn't happen for two reasons.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_160.wav|28|I think we believed the tie was won.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_323.wav|101|It is a court case.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_005.wav|29|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_109.wav|41|But it was a pleasure.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_178.wav|7|I always felt they played for me.)
DUMMY2/p228/p228_011.wav|57|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_250.wav|69|They must play for each other.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_394.wav|15|The plot is changing as time goes on.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_378.wav|11|It was located on the remote control.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_347.wav|102|The Israeli government is destroying the peace process.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_271.wav|42|Who reminded him about the score?
DUMMY2/p276/p276_013.wav|106|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_390.wav|41|Yet the data is compelling.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_355.wav|76|Next league matches, Motherwell - Dundee United.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_243.wav|68|How can they engage with the work?
DUMMY2/p272/p272_269.wav|69|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_066.wav|78|There is a lot to be done.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_041.wav|84|I have never been a member of the council.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_104.wav|58|The breakdown was much later in her life.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_391.wav|42|I believe that gap is nearly there.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_374.wav|20|But I managed.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_160.wav|25|But we have not heard a thing from Diego.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_260.wav|1|The question is, Is that a negative?
DUMMY2/p307/p307_076.wav|22|This is a mental challenge.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_018.wav|56|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_193.wav|96|The procedure is the same in all cases.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_254.wav|20|It was like the old days.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_220.wav|62|They are still going to be impulsive.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_234.wav|58|At this stage, we think the air campaign is enough.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_332.wav|47|He was then replaced by Ross.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_357.wav|18|We're talking to the US.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_287.wav|57|Right up until a week ago we thought they were very keen.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_272.wav|73|He looked very sharp.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_384.wav|35|The marshall at the turn was great.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_317.wav|50|They come to enjoy themselves.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_326.wav|62|I don't want to use the term.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_328.wav|46|But she's also beautiful behind the face.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_243.wav|102|It need not be like that.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_234.wav|57|We were a load of rubbish.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_216.wav|18|They know the language.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_240.wav|32|You will have seen the adverts.)
DUMMY2/p245/p245_287.wav|59|That could change.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_255.wav|57|That's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_383.wav|52|I just felt that I was broken down.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_257.wav|84|I watched a game.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_119.wav|42|It's an expensive part of their equipment.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_090.wav|27|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_108.wav|4|Chambers said he would accept the place.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_245.wav|36|She died in middle age.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_157.wav|27|My Dad is a hero.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_230.wav|94|I'd never seen a play about me.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_331.wav|16|There was no time scale.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_406.wav|17|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_315.wav|97|They didn't have a care in the world.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_434.wav|14|No-one wanted to run it tonight.)
DUMMY2/p225/p225_039.wav|101|However, the decision has been welcomed by Scottish Enterprise officials.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_135.wav|96|Our intentions are real.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_014.wav|39|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_037.wav|8|There will be no shortage of quality applicants.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_278.wav|46|Raymond was always on the outside.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_258.wav|19|Or so everyone believed.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_340.wav|94|There was no time scale.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_028.wav|60|You have been warned.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_112.wav|71|"This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election."
DUMMY2/p298/p298_002.wav|68|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_061.wav|44|The supporters gave us a lot of passion.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_052.wav|99|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_095.wav|60|It's not a game.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_237.wav|47|We have a free vote on these things in our party.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_247.wav|105|He said he intended to push for a judicial review.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_316.wav|49|The company's in good shape.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_375.wav|4|We don't ask for much.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_197.wav|0|Tommy is not a problem.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_304.wav|99|We have waited a long time for this.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_166.wav|67|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_219.wav|73|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_356.wav|55|Are they free ?
DUMMY2/p293/p293_294.wav|23|They never gave up hope.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_026.wav|28|The message was clear.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_434.wav|100|Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_389.wav|104|It wasn't about her singing, though.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_141.wav|107|The whole region is in shock.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_145.wav|50|It opens the door to the Champions League.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_021.wav|101|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_098.wav|63|Last weekend was extremely frustrating.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_106.wav|47|It is so sad.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_314.wav|95|It's called the Supreme Court for a reason.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_076.wav|2|He is driven.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_346.wav|55|Sources yesterday said the Royal Bank has declined to back him.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_120.wav|66|The choice is strictly personal.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_424.wav|8|This is a huge boost for my confidence.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_232.wav|44|The merger was welcomed by Tony Blair.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_137.wav|81|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_401.wav|41|It really is a gift to the world.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_129.wav|79|How do you take them away?
DUMMY2/p294/p294_248.wav|104|They never gave up hope.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_127.wav|33|The truth, of course, is very different.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_331.wav|39|Funding for the science centre has come from a number of sources.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_299.wav|61|She said she could not believe that they had run away.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_173.wav|69|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_260.wav|3|They are difficult awards to decide.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_205.wav|3|Was it the wife ?
DUMMY2/p310/p310_396.wav|17|It might not survive the process.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_330.wav|93|That's the law of the land.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_058.wav|78|This trend is likely to strengthen.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_256.wav|44|Partly, but only partly, this is their own fault.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_150.wav|35|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_120.wav|55|No country has a similar training programme.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_060.wav|2|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_087.wav|44|There were no passengers on board.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_148.wav|49|Drink and petrol prices remain untouched.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_050.wav|0|It is a different animal.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_417.wav|19|Sightings were replaced by rumours.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_176.wav|91|That will be the sweetness.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_008.wav|17|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and these two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_346.wav|33|Our season is not over.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_159.wav|24|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_295.wav|44|And that was the adults.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_351.wav|35|He is not very big, either.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_038.wav|35|They said she was stable.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_226.wav|76|From our point of view, it's the right time.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_210.wav|51|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_081.wav|73|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_084.wav|48|And it had two seats.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_124.wav|17|Five in a month isn't good enough.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_149.wav|9|You know the type.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_093.wav|5|It is home-grown.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_276.wav|82|He looked like a schoolboy.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_306.wav|73|I came into this world with nothing.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_410.wav|11|He said it was the worst possible result.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_368.wav|105|They really did a great job.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_164.wav|105|However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_394.wav|91|It's about my time as a guitarist.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_161.wav|23|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_394.wav|87|Low pay is endemic in the National Health Service.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_371.wav|93|That would help.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_304.wav|49|We are now setting about finding them.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_411.wav|89|He got his degree.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_236.wav|34|Anything can happen - at any moment.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_200.wav|62|Hear what they have to say.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_181.wav|11|I was doing well at the hustings.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_145.wav|89|Who would be right?
DUMMY2/p285/p285_306.wav|2|There is no excuse.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_072.wav|34|Advice and counselling will be offered.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_198.wav|15|Do what you want to do.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_271.wav|14|Did it work ?)
DUMMY2/p244/p244_382.wav|78|It's fantastic to win again.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_209.wav|75|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_358.wav|93|On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_237.wav|75|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_283.wav|46|The Real IRA was blamed for the blast.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_280.wav|2|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
DUMMY2/p280/p280_112.wav|52|What are they for ?
DUMMY2/p298/p298_081.wav|68|It is, in other words, Entrapment by another name.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_099.wav|69|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_135.wav|99|Government will intervene.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_065.wav|0|So is that it, then ?
DUMMY2/p345/p345_207.wav|82|Progress is being made but it is slow.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_334.wav|37|They will always be in our hearts and in our minds.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_398.wav|75|So is that it, then ?
DUMMY2/p334/p334_035.wav|38|Headteachers want their pupils to conform.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_207.wav|23|He was also married with two children.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_380.wav|25|We try to keep it right.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_090.wav|45|Then came the crunch.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_244.wav|87|Of course, it is a tough assignment.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_013.wav|13|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_141.wav|78|However, the bank denied that he was in the running.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_363.wav|8|An alternative must be offered.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_190.wav|21|I wouldn't want to miss that chance.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_113.wav|4|Don't get me wrong.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_468.wav|14|That should get their attention.)
DUMMY2/p246/p246_225.wav|5|But she was.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_162.wav|51|The pilot was making a visual approach.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_128.wav|77|But the main thing will be to avoid the bunkers.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_354.wav|8|There is a good example in this city.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_282.wav|36|Not many companies can say that these days.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_080.wav|86|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_361.wav|26|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_046.wav|45|I was angry.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_145.wav|9|The songs are just so good.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_276.wav|8|These figures are truly terrible.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_139.wav|76|Sub Not Used, McCulloch.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_048.wav|30|What's it got to do with art?
DUMMY2/p288/p288_045.wav|47|He is too weak to move.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_401.wav|70|Relief was beyond belief.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_143.wav|52|It appears that no holiday is complete without a good row.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_337.wav|31|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_285.wav|106|The strong performance is expected to continue.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_374.wav|10|Lord Macdonald has worked on this deal for three months.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_262.wav|54|I don't think it could be clearer.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_126.wav|15|I accept that, but it is very upsetting.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_091.wav|5|It was clear.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_218.wav|77|And the World Cup has not even begun.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_340.wav|63|I didn't have the reply.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_410.wav|64|Officials say the city must achieve this.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_164.wav|82|But perhaps we shouldn't worry too much.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_165.wav|29|We've made a couple of albums.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_373.wav|35|It's going to be fun.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_049.wav|43|But it might have done.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_103.wav|54|It is understood they saw one body.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_341.wav|56|Many of these properties are located in the south of England.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_104.wav|39|A progress report will be published in October.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_184.wav|32|Miller was every bit as happy.)
DUMMY2/p254/p254_394.wav|41|It is also claimed that he was murdered.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_247.wav|29|It is set in Paris.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_320.wav|80|Davis is very supportive, as a director.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_148.wav|25|They did very well.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_042.wav|30|We are looking for volunteers.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_028.wav|21|I was very, very pleased with our display.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_028.wav|59|We decided we would go for a specialist inside centre.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_281.wav|86|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_044.wav|5|We will push.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_237.wav|85|Then it was changed without notice.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_244.wav|92|It was a Budget for jobs for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_259.wav|16|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_130.wav|52|I could live without the attention, he admitted.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_145.wav|92|He's working hard on that right now.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_146.wav|13|I suggest a new plan.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_346.wav|95|The party lasted all night.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_356.wav|2|In fact, we were all over the shop.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_147.wav|1|He changed my life.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_202.wav|60|I'm really looking forward to that.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_099.wav|50|Two of the team became ill.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_162.wav|44|I'd go anywhere to work, so long as it's worth it.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_357.wav|14|It was tough to contain the excitement.)
DUMMY2/p267/p267_204.wav|0|Abbey National is an option.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_042.wav|91|I have played really well all year.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_039.wav|1|Or so she thought.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_072.wav|6|Thirty people have applied for his job!
DUMMY2/p299/p299_105.wav|58|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_115.wav|55|No progress has been made.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_095.wav|62|It will be a challenging film.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_070.wav|33|those who are preparing to give up.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_172.wav|42|I'm not talking about his career.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_144.wav|27|She died at her home.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_118.wav|76|We didn't get the supply to the forwards.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_022.wav|60|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_238.wav|22|We wanted it left for a wee while.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_168.wav|39|The other businesses were based in Yorkshire and Northern Ireland.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_072.wav|64|The jury is still out on this one.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_124.wav|68|John Reid, the Scottish secretary, also welcomed the news.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_310.wav|100|Size is not the issue.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_255.wav|78|A lot has been written.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_036.wav|11|I was contacted this morning.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_311.wav|18|The first time it was rejected.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_387.wav|77|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_076.wav|10|By then, he was walking on water.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_181.wav|58|You see - this business is a good one.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_296.wav|85|It didn't matter who was in their way.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_359.wav|66|There is too much at stake for that.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_262.wav|50|And they were being paid ?
DUMMY2/p335/p335_053.wav|49|Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_155.wav|52|Time may already have run out for this option.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_260.wav|46|I was just overwhelmed.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_104.wav|91|I needed a change, a new challenge.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_067.wav|104|I fell in love with it right away.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_277.wav|87|First, the programme was unbalanced.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_018.wav|50|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_074.wav|57|Painful, but only because it's true.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_003.wav|53|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_102.wav|34|That respect is missing in the Netherlands.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_074.wav|79|They said there was nothing.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_252.wav|96|We did not compete with any other local farmer.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_308.wav|47|SCOTLAND has shown the way.

DUMMY2/p255/p255_315.wav|31|The election is total confusion and chaos.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_108.wav|69|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_077.wav|59|That is bound to happen.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_002.wav|47|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_031.wav|42|I started on fire a couple of times.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_326.wav|106|Is our children learning ?
DUMMY2/p240/p240_257.wav|93|Her presence was almost everywhere.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_128.wav|2|We work well together.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_002.wav|71|"Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  "
DUMMY2/p297/p297_334.wav|42|There is no smoking gun.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_121.wav|82|He is the Acting and Deputy First Minister.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_016.wav|10|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_406.wav|50|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_250.wav|105|They are interior designers and architects.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_319.wav|32|McNaughton was not so sure.)
DUMMY2/p339/p339_089.wav|18|She had to learn a new discipline.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_389.wav|34|I did not concentrate on my performance.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_348.wav|25|The pressure is on Celtic in the main.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_332.wav|87|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_209.wav|18|Everything in the symphony is there.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_176.wav|29|But he has a lifeline.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_334.wav|1|What are you waiting for?
DUMMY2/p259/p259_396.wav|7|That is a crazy situation.)
DUMMY2/p360/p360_077.wav|60|I have to hand it to the bank.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_375.wav|65|We have a high quality product.)
DUMMY2/p271/p271_192.wav|27|What has caused the demise of singing?
DUMMY2/p238/p238_164.wav|37|Yet the survey has been cautious.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_164.wav|66|It was then into overtime.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_339.wav|103|I'll take the blame for that.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_244.wav|88|It was a surprising decision.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_125.wav|64|Whatever he does, however, it will be decisive.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_234.wav|82|That is not an easy thing.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_074.wav|11|That money could have been coming to Scotland.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_125.wav|92|The look on his face was something special.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_293.wav|60|I have never been unemployed.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_066.wav|93|They are real.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_282.wav|17|I'd never heard him in person before.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_144.wav|35|The first thing is to assess the damage that has been done.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_337.wav|15|It was quite an ordeal for them.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_019.wav|64|Since then physicists have found that it is not a reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_194.wav|12|I am considered a teenager.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_075.wav|25|It is like a river running by my home.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_223.wav|76|We remain committed to it, as does the government.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_010.wav|16|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_007.wav|30|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_343.wav|49|And the reason isn't too hard to fathom.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_015.wav|96|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_243.wav|62|That's where it all started.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_342.wav|66|We are very nearly there.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_175.wav|32|They are determined to make a meaningful contribution.)
DUMMY2/p363/p363_349.wav|6|Nobody was able to escape.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_251.wav|34|Maybe they will show it next year.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_178.wav|9|We are very concerned about controller fatigue.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_321.wav|98|Nobody should believe this story.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_199.wav|37|Did he trip ?
DUMMY2/p374/p374_038.wav|11|It's not just a challenge for us.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_481.wav|24|Their coach is obviously under a lot of pressure.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_213.wav|49|You saw the pain he was in.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_351.wav|75|He had no previous convictions.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_135.wav|41|It's terrible that he has died the same way.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_228.wav|32|The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.)
DUMMY2/p335/p335_111.wav|49|It is not fair.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_116.wav|37|Accordingly, financial restructuring is required.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_182.wav|8|I'm pretty happy with the way I played.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_381.wav|42|He loved his job and working in newspapers.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_297.wav|25|Right up until a week ago we thought they were very keen.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_163.wav|82|IT takes the biscuit.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_225.wav|96|We've got the bronze.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_205.wav|53|Hague will be leader at the election after next.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_126.wav|39|When we played them last year, we were beaten by the weather.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_307.wav|5|The plot is minimal.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_370.wav|22|Mr Straw was home secretary at the time.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_325.wav|0|It is all credit to them today.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_071.wav|48|Then they scored two goals to win.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_005.wav|37|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_028.wav|34|Now it is much easier.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_419.wav|22|It's a policy which has worked for us.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_108.wav|73|It is rubbish.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_095.wav|50|This is the logic of punishment assaults.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_358.wav|84|You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_277.wav|95|I would do away with the dress code.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_276.wav|49|That is highly unfair.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_049.wav|82|Who would be a referee?
DUMMY2/p316/p316_039.wav|85|We just want this season to end.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_292.wav|51|I'm very tired, but it was worth it.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_281.wav|28|Mr Burrell was arrested almost a year ago.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_363.wav|34|I think she is supreme.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_009.wav|103|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_269.wav|66|It's one up to the Scots.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_028.wav|102|The important thing was to be there, and to experience it.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_075.wav|70|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_110.wav|86|We want to help them through it.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_113.wav|99|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_107.wav|87|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_421.wav|37|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_352.wav|3|And it's a goodbye from him.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_431.wav|36|Together, we can make a difference.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_235.wav|70|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_329.wav|106|Are they free ?
DUMMY2/p299/p299_258.wav|58|I'm just doing artwork.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_309.wav|102|With him are the symbols of his faith.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_389.wav|48|A new school will be built.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_097.wav|10|Our house was very small.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_314.wav|36|We are in the end game.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_428.wav|106|It seems a waste of talents.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_209.wav|51|You saw the football.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_445.wav|89|The children are fine.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_214.wav|20|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_290.wav|5|He will address the nation this evening.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_299.wav|31|Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_265.wav|27|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_071.wav|8|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_001.wav|24|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_251.wav|66|He admitted the asylum system was not working.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_085.wav|83|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
DUMMY2/p249/p249_145.wav|80|It is difficult for Ali.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_212.wav|107|River City is a showcase for Scottish talent.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_126.wav|86|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_021.wav|22|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_072.wav|88|There is no hiding place.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_326.wav|91|It needs to be sorted out by Easter.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_314.wav|106|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_195.wav|4|They seem to turn up for them.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_162.wav|75|I have got a wife to feed.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_223.wav|84|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_273.wav|79|My husband was fighting for his life.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_225.wav|39|Bombing is the easy option.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_269.wav|47|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_183.wav|60|You have to wait.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_011.wav|48|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_259.wav|38|I am getting long in the tooth.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_214.wav|98|I have friends in Glasgow.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_003.wav|79|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_361.wav|27|And he laughs.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_120.wav|52|It is the right package for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_331.wav|36|It looks as though the issue with The Scotsman is too sensitive.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_287.wav|15|He is also a great finisher.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_369.wav|4|We have some concerns.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_097.wav|27|Then came the crunch.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_071.wav|56|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_377.wav|17|Such actions are rarely popular.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_111.wav|24|He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_348.wav|57|Everyone was in tears.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_073.wav|39|It was nice to get a clean sheet.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_076.wav|71|"Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general."
DUMMY2/p364/p364_107.wav|88|We are not leaving the area.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_201.wav|50|Does the name matter ?
DUMMY2/p301/p301_119.wav|91|It is not great art.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_300.wav|69|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_165.wav|75|We have a budget in March.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_383.wav|32|It was like a weekly wage.)
DUMMY2/p305/p305_308.wav|54|It worked, up to a point.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_305.wav|13|It may have been a cry for help.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_001.wav|100|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_127.wav|102|I went straight to the toilet.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_320.wav|70|Is there a new way forward?
DUMMY2/p231/p231_214.wav|50|He also presented You Bet!
DUMMY2/p339/p339_304.wav|18|He had planned to sell it.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_158.wav|51|It is believed she had serious head injuries.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_103.wav|63|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_080.wav|13|That was him under pressure.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_151.wav|24|I love the spectacle of cinema.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_041.wav|1|This advice was accepted by ministers.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_241.wav|79|He was also very happy to listen.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_207.wav|93|We will give a formal response to the report in due course.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_073.wav|15|I am going to win the next two.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_334.wav|76|She has nothing to say to journalists.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_388.wav|46|It was a lot of hard work, but it wasn't difficult.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_199.wav|100|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_174.wav|16|I'm just going to hit the shot.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_040.wav|83|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_350.wav|24|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_075.wav|23|His behaviour today has been disgusting.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_300.wav|41|The plot is minimal.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_060.wav|66|I think it is a sensible change.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_158.wav|59|Everyone can be bought.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_045.wav|66|Her daughter is getting married.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_087.wav|5|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_384.wav|94|It is obvious that we are engaged in a war.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_032.wav|6|If that is the case, it is a breakthrough.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_011.wav|107|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_474.wav|100|My place is in the kitchen.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_236.wav|100|They have not been in touch with the club.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_391.wav|63|Is it worth it ?
DUMMY2/p312/p312_323.wav|62|That will be the case on Tuesday.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_274.wav|15|For me, it's a tension you can feel.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_232.wav|100|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_010.wav|74|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_347.wav|6|Gritty he did not want.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_345.wav|25|The salary changes are long overdue.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_022.wav|72|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_159.wav|32|Full back was a bit of the unknown.)
DUMMY2/p280/p280_232.wav|52|The mother and daughter had moved into the property about six months ago.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_025.wav|86|She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_250.wav|81|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_323.wav|28|I don't want to change anything.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_406.wav|25|Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_085.wav|57|But she might be.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_096.wav|2|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_060.wav|34|I think that's a bit of an invasion.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_412.wav|46|She said he showed no remorse.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_267.wav|98|Not that it is unique.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_178.wav|28|THE US is a diverse and colourful nation.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_235.wav|15|He is advised that he has done so.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_212.wav|9|We have an election in eight days.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_108.wav|65|I first met him last summer.)
DUMMY2/p336/p336_403.wav|98|I'm certainly thinking about retirement.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_351.wav|55|No plans for projects are yet in place.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_312.wav|63|Our season is not finished.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_456.wav|7|Last week against Nelson, we allowed them several opportunities.)
DUMMY2/p285/p285_315.wav|2|A review is under way.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_076.wav|90|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_181.wav|24|That would open the gates of hell.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_303.wav|41|We have waited a long time for this.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_027.wav|80|It's nice to hear.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_406.wav|62|It was meant to rival the dollar.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_311.wav|87|In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_356.wav|48|So, did she meet him ?
DUMMY2/p292/p292_246.wav|13|It starts to get you down.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_350.wav|7|The pound has also suffered.)
DUMMY2/p271/p271_211.wav|27|I don't want to use it.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_424.wav|42|John Prescott is John Prescott, as the prime minister would say.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_358.wav|17|This is the lowest of the low.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_204.wav|100|It was his own decision.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_374.wav|66|See it while you can.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_346.wav|46|His name is Michael Owen.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_077.wav|106|The wingers must have felt the cold.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_237.wav|34|He predicted the contest would be very close.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_189.wav|11|Archer is no newcomer to the stage.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_198.wav|69|They make a selective perception process.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_090.wav|14|Petrol prices were widely blamed.)
DUMMY2/p363/p363_249.wav|6|I can hardly believe it.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_128.wav|8|Becoming a father was wonderful.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_395.wav|15|I never got anything out of it.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_050.wav|21|It is a beautiful country.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_128.wav|107|THE arrow was aimed at the heart.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_046.wav|56|The drivers had an awful lot of verbal abuse.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_312.wav|103|But both were involved with other matters.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_368.wav|42|It has proved a double whammy.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_044.wav|30|Subs not used, McCulloch.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_058.wav|44|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_091.wav|99|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_235.wav|71|"We lost our composure towards the interval, he said."
DUMMY2/p347/p347_075.wav|46|Then it was the turn of the carnival.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_331.wav|62|It's the big omission.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_117.wav|78|This is a sea change in approach.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_359.wav|35|Three years ago he would have been.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_395.wav|35|Are they free ?
DUMMY2/p232/p232_201.wav|96|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_289.wav|94|I intended to look for another club on loan.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_071.wav|19|There were no formal announcements.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_303.wav|80|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_401.wav|10|They know it'll be fantastic.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_446.wav|50|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_123.wav|17|Mr Straw was home secretary at the time.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_121.wav|26|I could see his desire for the job in his eyes.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_145.wav|21|We are not going to get carried away.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_325.wav|63|They can go to no other method of fishing.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_265.wav|69|It's a way of life.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_308.wav|67|It's just not funny !
DUMMY2/p295/p295_233.wav|92|Her body was found on Monday morning.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_364.wav|94|As, indeed, they would be.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_060.wav|48|And they removed a Borderer.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_250.wav|10|That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_289.wav|65|You have made your point.)
DUMMY2/p294/p294_140.wav|104|It was a hugely popular decision.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_349.wav|103|That is absolute nonsense.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_117.wav|68|And it's more subversive.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_444.wav|65|The company was set up six years ago.)
DUMMY2/p363/p363_036.wav|6|It certainly is cause for concern.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_075.wav|51|So far this season this approach is working.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_254.wav|36|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_371.wav|22|There is no magical figure, but there are criteria.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_010.wav|8|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_179.wav|89|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_329.wav|93|We do the same.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_178.wav|24|I'd love to be like Peter.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_112.wav|5|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_298.wav|40|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_199.wav|71|"The sisters also became the top two players in the world."
DUMMY2/p250/p250_199.wav|24|He was rejected because he had retired.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_146.wav|58|There is too much at stake for that.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_076.wav|21|We are at the crossroads.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_186.wav|55|Art can challenge our value system.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_057.wav|100|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
DUMMY2/p239/p239_410.wav|48|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_120.wav|34|We have a high quality product.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_254.wav|89|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_145.wav|87|What do we want to do that for ?
DUMMY2/p225/p225_179.wav|101|They know no other way.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_107.wav|21|I am not a paedophile.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_067.wav|56|Both sides have been hit by injury.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_387.wav|63|The marshall at the turn was great.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_018.wav|5|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_035.wav|2|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_066.wav|44|Who, then, is going to be captain of Europe?
DUMMY2/p351/p351_109.wav|33|Who will pay for this?
DUMMY2/p272/p272_054.wav|69|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_072.wav|29|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_032.wav|20|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_186.wav|1|I think it'll be a great occasion.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_304.wav|53|Had I heard ?
DUMMY2/p243/p243_355.wav|53|It is not a material issue for a group with our strength.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_191.wav|64|When he took over it really took off.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_019.wav|9|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_392.wav|38|He would take up the bike.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_231.wav|51|She was a delightful person.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_143.wav|40|It seems so long since I did the exams.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_328.wav|57|It has moved on in the last week.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_071.wav|97|I've come here for the jersey.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_400.wav|20|But, in fact, the reverse is true.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_084.wav|87|Kenny Miller might come through.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_236.wav|97|Michael, he is running!
DUMMY2/p225/p225_295.wav|101|Clydesdale Bank declined to comment.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_069.wav|100|There could be a way back.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_256.wav|72|But experts have disputed that statistic.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_039.wav|74|It is a recipe for success.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_025.wav|12|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_306.wav|63|We feel very comfortable in this international environment.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_327.wav|45|It is a private matter between the firm and our staff.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_327.wav|47|I came into this world with nothing.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_055.wav|15|He is one of them.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_303.wav|90|It's so awful.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_074.wav|1|This makes up for it.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_326.wav|107|Some old favourites remain in varying forms.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_132.wav|88|He just attracted people.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_101.wav|102|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_064.wav|89|That's the truth.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_130.wav|51|It's very tragic and traumatic.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_260.wav|20|Souter will be back.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_021.wav|89|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_339.wav|26|It was so new, so exciting.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_009.wav|80|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_200.wav|30|They had not been handcuffed.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_277.wav|54|They married in August last year.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_160.wav|31|Work has started.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_287.wav|25|Who will perform?
DUMMY2/p236/p236_359.wav|75|Scotland is the home of golf.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_346.wav|13|The overall effect is impressive, but distancing.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_352.wav|32|It was tough to contain the excitement.)
DUMMY2/p317/p317_349.wav|97|There was no need for such a hostel.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_072.wav|50|Then followed a bout of flu.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_466.wav|65|It's a strategy which would work beyond this show.)
DUMMY2/p316/p316_326.wav|85|He was happy with his form.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_221.wav|104|The six others were injured.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_237.wav|20|It is hard won.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_027.wav|56|Because we do not need it.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_339.wav|43|My view has now completely changed.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_265.wav|101|It was a Budget for jobs for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_227.wav|30|plays in dark blue.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_297.wav|72|What will they called?
DUMMY2/p317/p317_299.wav|97|Some reports said they had been killed.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_391.wav|22|I had no qualms about it.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_197.wav|78|That you can do it.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_062.wav|55|For a decade she was proved right.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_395.wav|68|I am just looking to God.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_088.wav|54|I drove the ball well.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_246.wav|16|There will be widespread support on all sides.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_297.wav|26|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_286.wav|1|She was shouting my baby, my baby.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_160.wav|68|They were both delightful to work with.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_071.wav|6|This is a judgment issue.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_349.wav|81|Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_157.wav|94|He will emerge as a world leader.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_379.wav|98|It may be the first of many.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_320.wav|23|Eleven events are required.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_090.wav|46|It is a hangover effect.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_143.wav|39|how do you get it back ?
DUMMY2/p274/p274_397.wav|32|It's never great to finish second.)
DUMMY2/p286/p286_232.wav|63|It will affect their work.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_010.wav|19|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_095.wav|11|That, though, is not true.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_334.wav|84|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_104.wav|67|We work on the same level.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_279.wav|92|Glasgow is about to enter a new era.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_114.wav|81|I did not see any reason to change the captain.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_075.wav|44|She goes to the opening of an envelope.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_411.wav|50|After the match, do you ?
DUMMY2/p326/p326_358.wav|28|Labour is providing none of these.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_190.wav|73|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_149.wav|98|This may be perfectly innocent.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_187.wav|69|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_241.wav|35|Half the young people had had contact with the police.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_143.wav|77|We will turn the corner.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_332.wav|103|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_350.wav|86|There is a cup final at stake.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_379.wav|70|At the last I found a bunker.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_075.wav|56|No progress has been made.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_064.wav|84|It was an amazing result.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_241.wav|11|It's always somebody else's.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_262.wav|55|So we kept them waiting.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_029.wav|27|They have no history.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_193.wav|92|If we live forever, can we really be said to live?
DUMMY2/p243/p243_134.wav|53|There is no future in rock music.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_296.wav|104|It just would not work.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_168.wav|31|We have to move forward.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_422.wav|107|Last night they were being comforted by relatives.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_167.wav|93|That must be left to the Parole Board.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_155.wav|21|They've been wonderful to me.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_151.wav|71|"The weaknesses are few."
DUMMY2/p295/p295_091.wav|92|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_268.wav|51|I took a minibus into town.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_279.wav|42|Part of England, is not?
DUMMY2/p285/p285_310.wav|2|We are a peaceful people.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_157.wav|15|And he still is.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_264.wav|10|I'm pleased with some aspects of the performance.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_423.wav|103|What will happen if it all goes wrong?
DUMMY2/p270/p270_070.wav|8|Last night, the move was bitterly denounced by France Telecom.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_117.wav|28|Hopefully, everything is for the best.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_257.wav|19|Nor is it likely to do so.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_329.wav|56|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_051.wav|78|In my view, it has to be done.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_386.wav|15|It's a good offer by any standards.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_173.wav|95|Today I had no failures in my team.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_364.wav|29|Had this been common practice ?
DUMMY2/p257/p257_195.wav|105|Ferguson should take note.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_215.wav|74|The seller was not revealed.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_145.wav|29|These men are a part of India.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_139.wav|29|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_052.wav|63|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
DUMMY2/p261/p261_325.wav|100|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_369.wav|7|They promised to fight the plans.)
DUMMY2/p270/p270_140.wav|8|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_147.wav|71|"He will emerge as a world leader."
DUMMY2/p266/p266_410.wav|20|He got his degree.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_205.wav|60|We didn't, and it worked for us.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_044.wav|89|I did not see any reason to change the captain.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_355.wav|4|We think a lot of Allan McGregor.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_214.wav|106|We did what we had to do.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_278.wav|42|We've always had a very positive attitude.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_346.wav|67|Indeed, it was magical.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_170.wav|49|Wednesday's decision came as a surprise.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_388.wav|87|Civic leaders yesterday praised the good behaviour of revellers across the country.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_032.wav|47|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_042.wav|87|What do we do ?
DUMMY2/p310/p310_141.wav|17|They receive a high profile in the media.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_115.wav|84|We do not expect any surplus.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_094.wav|102|You had better believe it.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_308.wav|15|We all make mistakes.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_227.wav|6|They know nothing about the sport.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_064.wav|92|It is, after all, a very funny play.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_391.wav|106|Corporate banking would be based in Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_219.wav|71|"It is a gamble."
DUMMY2/p336/p336_394.wav|98|There were few surprises.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_034.wav|96|It is marvellous.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_386.wav|33|Neither was in the squad announced yesterday.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_104.wav|60|The call was ignored.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_148.wav|33|My neighbours are horrified.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_052.wav|0|I must take a seat.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_228.wav|68|That will bring about a dramatic improvement.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_323.wav|36|I can see their argument.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_357.wav|53|It is the only natural British site on the list.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_043.wav|11|I still hope to go.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_090.wav|33|This is already happening.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_116.wav|25|This film will be totally awesome.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_332.wav|89|Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_186.wav|96|It is the whole package.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_137.wav|66|At this stage, we think the air campaign is enough.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_166.wav|63|My Dad is a hero.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_402.wav|55|So what happens next ?
DUMMY2/p280/p280_165.wav|52|But the game is still wide open.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_214.wav|26|It's not ideal.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_054.wav|83|Every aspect of our play was first class.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_371.wav|50|The result is called a patent.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_015.wav|13|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_422.wav|50|Yet the data is compelling.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_357.wav|27|That would help.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_032.wav|27|I'd just like to play.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_019.wav|8|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_164.wav|36|I have got a wife to feed.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_183.wav|2|Many innocent people will die.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_322.wav|73|This is a friendly match?
DUMMY2/p279/p279_076.wav|25|The end result is precisely the same.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_240.wav|52|Was it the wife ?
DUMMY2/p287/p287_302.wav|77|It has to be an event.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_228.wav|18|I see it as my job.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_138.wav|91|The son has autism and other problems.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_089.wav|2|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_400.wav|25|A new leader is unlikely to be chosen before September.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_085.wav|85|It is, after all, a very funny play.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_207.wav|8|The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_173.wav|46|I never found my rhythm.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_348.wav|21|No one can say that about me.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_372.wav|79|It is very funny.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_014.wav|97|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_030.wav|51|I believe in the Church.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_012.wav|34|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_006.wav|66|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_258.wav|41|The pensioners did not want to know.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_055.wav|45|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_330.wav|106|Friday night was a pretty good night.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_431.wav|39|They recorded their debut album in New York.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_081.wav|19|Who wants to be a millionaire?
DUMMY2/p263/p263_276.wav|39|That could be in place by next year.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_120.wav|93|It is a delight on every level.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_348.wav|28|I can't see him reversing that.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_085.wav|100|They deserve a lot of credit.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_393.wav|96|A council spokesman said it had been a constructive meeting.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_266.wav|10|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_139.wav|31|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_400.wav|74|They were not defeated.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_297.wav|102|There is bound to be a formal complaint.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_191.wav|46|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_375.wav|41|It is a large number.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_218.wav|34|The process itself has taken over.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_014.wav|25|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_288.wav|68|It was rather a distorted image of Islam.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_314.wav|28|Perhaps it is the Crown Estate.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_333.wav|60|Pakistan denied the report.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_111.wav|51|Is my wife a racist?
DUMMY2/p335/p335_121.wav|49|The final stage is paranoia.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_292.wav|68|I have been coming here for nine years.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_358.wav|6|But it is a fact.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_294.wav|53|The agreement remains the only show in town.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_008.wav|58|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_293.wav|59|There was no hint of scandal.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_258.wav|2|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_187.wav|55|It involved everything in terms of behaviour.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_222.wav|48|There's always the next century.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_148.wav|83|It is not just about pay.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_185.wav|90|We did everything by the book.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_010.wav|61|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_114.wav|53|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
DUMMY2/p299/p299_244.wav|58|From a marketing standpoint, you can understand their concern.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_236.wav|28|Seems a sensible compromise.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_379.wav|106|Laura is an investment banker.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_193.wav|66|It has to be a long-term commitment.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_345.wav|81|I've got no secret.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_362.wav|54|It gave me something to focus on.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_004.wav|106|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_151.wav|35|These days are long gone.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_314.wav|68|What if the confession is, after all, a fake?
DUMMY2/p250/p250_355.wav|24|Many of these properties are located in the south of England.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_179.wav|41|Tony had arrived.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_152.wav|24|We will try to find someone.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_407.wav|62|There is no easy answer.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_488.wav|75|It worked well in Monaco.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_275.wav|90|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_240.wav|102|Was all this really just five months ago?
DUMMY2/p263/p263_322.wav|39|However, a bid was never made.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_192.wav|97|He said that this is beautiful.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_213.wav|70|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_142.wav|58|Such a city does not exist.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_336.wav|87|The only problem was the greens.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_299.wav|55|He followed the Italian route.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_210.wav|73|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_379.wav|54|Meanwhile, the business of government goes on.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_262.wav|22|Scotland has been caught in the crossfire.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_120.wav|95|There is no credible official announcement.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_173.wav|54|Singing has gone out of fashion.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_045.wav|5|Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_129.wav|57|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_081.wav|15|I have to accept that.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_043.wav|78|Something has to be put in place.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_359.wav|45|He's very explosive.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_159.wav|30|It's my favourite place to hang out.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_430.wav|24|He's had to suffer for the last six years.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_241.wav|81|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_020.wav|67|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_274.wav|45|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_243.wav|105|I didn't need to watch it on the video.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_117.wav|67|They were behind the wheel.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_136.wav|36|People come from all round the world to see it.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_348.wav|55|That was our last chance to do something.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_277.wav|46|She had been in Germany for medical treatment.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_338.wav|99|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_309.wav|49|Luckily for us, he enjoyed the experience.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_076.wav|40|Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_369.wav|29|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_299.wav|37|What do we want to do that for ?
DUMMY2/p227/p227_286.wav|29|Not many companies can say that these days.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_354.wav|21|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_154.wav|61|It opens the door to the Champions League.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_101.wav|107|Because of this, he feels the hearing had been unfair.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_044.wav|64|Nobody else was with me.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_196.wav|36|Aberdeen had little to offer.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_083.wav|17|I wish they, too, would get a grip.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_197.wav|71|"The service from the other players was super."
DUMMY2/p257/p257_062.wav|105|There will be tough opponents to this report.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_201.wav|74|He has seen the past.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_129.wav|48|What form did that take ?
DUMMY2/p250/p250_182.wav|24|Further growth will be funded from cash flow.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_363.wav|97|Suddenly it was, indeed, a new ball game.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_166.wav|96|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_203.wav|79|Everyone knew the family.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_060.wav|22|They have a way of proclaiming themselves.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_363.wav|60|It is time to fight a decisive battle.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_324.wav|80|I am so upset.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_264.wav|34|That is very hard, alone.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_043.wav|39|She is believed to be in South Africa.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_180.wav|15|This is a fine appointment.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_109.wav|65|The newspapers, by contrast, had held their value.)
DUMMY2/p238/p238_091.wav|37|The result is utterly compelling.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_333.wav|35|After some discussion they did.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_058.wav|69|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_457.wav|48|It was never a free kick.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_226.wav|88|It hasn't worked out that way.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_295.wav|43|He should have won.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_280.wav|72|That used to be another thing of mine.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_091.wav|8|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_050.wav|16|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_365.wav|64|I'm really proud of my young players.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_332.wav|50|In the old days, it was easy.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_240.wav|12|Was all this really just five months ago?
DUMMY2/p238/p238_371.wav|37|We will likely look for new investors.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_055.wav|34|He doesn't need to be told, he knows the truth.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_087.wav|97|If you're a national company, you must provide it all.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_217.wav|104|It's not a question of talking.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_085.wav|105|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_405.wav|50|It was a bank holiday, after all.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_446.wav|24|Last week against Nelson, we allowed them several opportunities.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_116.wav|95|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_461.wav|106|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_160.wav|73|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_273.wav|59|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_204.wav|10|It comes from reflection or thinking.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_263.wav|57|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_213.wav|43|Feel the heat?
DUMMY2/p232/p232_206.wav|96|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_111.wav|93|It's a question of perception.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_006.wav|86|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_129.wav|58|The case will now go to appeal.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_023.wav|104|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_117.wav|30|I want to play at the highest level.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_191.wav|36|I have accepted the challenge.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_268.wav|58|She is a great talent.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_022.wav|69|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_084.wav|94|That is bound to happen.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_017.wav|69|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_315.wav|20|We have got no money to go anywhere.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_215.wav|1|It had to be more flexible.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_085.wav|78|It starts with the script.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_176.wav|19|It is very much a matter for them.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_025.wav|89|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_173.wav|80|It is not too late to get on board.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_236.wav|72|You can't have it both ways.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_286.wav|58|They must act now to tighten the rules.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_289.wav|68|Mr Blair was in Washington a week later.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_114.wav|23|You, the British people, are the boss.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_074.wav|6|We are not commenting at the moment.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_270.wav|25|It was an easy decision to come here.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_104.wav|97|If so, how does it intend to achieve this result?
DUMMY2/p295/p295_114.wav|92|The band was good, and it's been a great day.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_332.wav|15|It is quite hard to track.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_227.wav|95|I suggest a new plan.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_299.wav|107|I really don't understand what is happening.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_064.wav|98|The second is freedom.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_361.wav|47|Our numbers are small.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_180.wav|89|They need to look after themselves.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_116.wav|19|We act because we must.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_205.wav|83|We have an election in eight days.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_153.wav|22|He was forced to quit.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_265.wav|92|Now, she has completed a family tradition.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_338.wav|69|Tell us about it.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_145.wav|73|He then asked if he could have her seat and she refused.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_108.wav|88|The airspace above the theatre was closed off.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_245.wav|25|The scene is about this?
DUMMY2/p247/p247_084.wav|14|The party is up for it.)
DUMMY2/p231/p231_426.wav|50|My aim is a top six finish.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_169.wav|23|I just want to enjoy myself.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_344.wav|53|Martin O Neill called this game almost exactly right.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_222.wav|66|It is all one-sided.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_118.wav|100|But it took a lot of bottle.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_085.wav|26|It is a simple equation.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_246.wav|94|I know I'm in a very special position.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_147.wav|3|She does not want to speak.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_231.wav|10|Who was she ?
DUMMY2/p230/p230_179.wav|35|It makes no influence on the public.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_104.wav|107|Early warnings could help, but it's a scary thought.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_112.wav|60|She was close to suicide at one stage.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_261.wav|78|But it was a loss.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_074.wav|99|I had my suspicions.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_238.wav|92|The party will make up its own mind.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_321.wav|9|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_149.wav|33|They will be ready.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_025.wav|22|But it was a great decision he joked.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_194.wav|39|Says the Duke of York.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_337.wav|35|Do you think we are a top nation ?
DUMMY2/p251/p251_006.wav|9|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_367.wav|47|I am a star.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_212.wav|59|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_202.wav|33|Ownership was the game.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_262.wav|3|His second was a beauty.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_292.wav|93|He will address the nation this evening.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_069.wav|18|Services are being expanded, too.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_135.wav|77|We will provide immediate access.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_206.wav|14|The result is utterly compelling.)
DUMMY2/p323/p323_217.wav|34|I have no plans to change the oath.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_078.wav|102|We must move on.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_050.wav|35|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_216.wav|76|We're still paying the price for that.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_100.wav|79|What has changed since then?
DUMMY2/p280/p280_364.wav|52|Both players gave so much to the side.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_196.wav|9|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_165.wav|56|Says the Duke of York.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_044.wav|22|Tourism in Scotland is facing a financial disaster.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_129.wav|27|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_212.wav|86|A Grampian Police spokesman said.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_230.wav|36|It had all been arranged.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_362.wav|55|He was a great human being.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_063.wav|62|They chose the latter.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_199.wav|76|So they will settle again.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_127.wav|64|It was a disaster.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_123.wav|93|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_293.wav|74|The Dream is as hard as they come.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_127.wav|28|I've beaten her a few times.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_345.wav|28|I can't speak for him.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_147.wav|56|Had I heard ?
DUMMY2/p257/p257_176.wav|105|It's quite a routine.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_259.wav|27|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_206.wav|23|I expected a victory, the pain is enormous.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_088.wav|22|So other options had to be explored.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_014.wav|69|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_117.wav|90|It was ugly.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_345.wav|52|Neither police nor hotel management had any record of the incident.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_033.wav|32|You must always attempt to raise the bar.)
DUMMY2/p330/p330_244.wav|1|They should take their mobile phones.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_072.wav|54|How do you resurrect a dying town?
DUMMY2/p227/p227_178.wav|29|I'm just going to hit the shot.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_373.wav|98|Further expansion is possible.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_353.wav|45|On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_377.wav|2|It will be an exciting finale to the season without a doubt.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_042.wav|81|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_347.wav|36|It will now be unveiled in the US in July.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_243.wav|16|I should think so, too.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_208.wav|93|It's a mixture of everything.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_453.wav|7|Strangely enough I felt very sharp.)
DUMMY2/p253/p253_222.wav|70|I'd never seen a play about me.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_181.wav|43|I've been there.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_381.wav|37|It was cynical and callous.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_324.wav|96|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_234.wav|81|The whole thing will be great.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_192.wav|33|Our policy is clear.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_356.wav|100|I've got a sense of humour, too.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_260.wav|58|I don't want to use the term.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_423.wav|39|Head injuries are the leading cause of death.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_456.wav|48|Now it has doubled in size.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_244.wav|93|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_229.wav|66|I'm not saying he is finished.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_118.wav|37|It's going to be epic.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_288.wav|28|They have to work so hard.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_269.wav|68|After that nothing could save him.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_288.wav|12|It puts the thought out, for other people to think about.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_369.wav|41|Five members were disciplined.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_029.wav|77|He has the courage of the unaware.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_323.wav|35|The group is not paying a dividend.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_421.wav|51|He is not very big, either.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_135.wav|83|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_011.wav|88|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_391.wav|28|My father had been unwell for many years.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_143.wav|20|He realises his mistake.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_020.wav|23|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_144.wav|19|They played it like a cup final.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_177.wav|32|And they were being paid ?)
DUMMY2/p374/p374_194.wav|11|This is the New Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_127.wav|24|I understand the medical concerns.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_412.wav|92|That can happen so easily.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_267.wav|38|The weaknesses are few.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_084.wav|60|His musicals were very much of their time.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_041.wav|45|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_002.wav|50|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_150.wav|76|Still, in the end, it was a fair result.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_035.wav|21|I read it every year.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_220.wav|39|They are in the euro.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_310.wav|70|We have got to get the points from this one.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_328.wav|16|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_139.wav|74|Weather conditions were good, he added.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_323.wav|68|She is, however, fully conscious and able to speak.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_062.wav|53|The referee is there to decide these things.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_334.wav|54|The casting of her husband was an accident.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_186.wav|9|I cannot say too much about them.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_232.wav|90|The body follows the mind.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_054.wav|94|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_159.wav|72|This is not a Scottish problem.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_106.wav|93|Getting new people interested in this music is the real reward.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_190.wav|17|The show is small but perfectly formed.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_273.wav|0|Not many companies can say that these days.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_146.wav|15|Who is going to pay their wages?
DUMMY2/p345/p345_345.wav|82|But something has been lost in the translation.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_304.wav|78|Every one is a winner.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_218.wav|2|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_322.wav|37|And we have the experience.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_068.wav|82|We were caught out.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_241.wav|10|A small number of new jobs will also be created.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_325.wav|33|Seven people were already in custody in France.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_316.wav|73|Who will do it?
DUMMY2/p318/p318_171.wav|19|The ministers are now to make their decision.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_171.wav|69|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_024.wav|22|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_382.wav|14|There is no deal as yet.)
DUMMY2/p273/p273_035.wav|56|Among them are many criminals.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_342.wav|78|That is the lesson of the last three weeks.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_223.wav|104|They are not the answer to staff shortages.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_328.wav|95|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
DUMMY2/p277/p277_325.wav|89|Well, it won't.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_239.wav|33|Blood samples were taken.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_404.wav|15|That's a good sign.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_285.wav|85|We've got the bronze.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_193.wav|55|We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_236.wav|35|It had so much to do with output.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_076.wav|104|She now lives in London.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_022.wav|5|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_448.wav|14|There were no formal announcements.)
DUMMY2/p336/p336_303.wav|98|It is three years.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_269.wav|78|The party has never fully recovered.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_228.wav|92|Not so, it transpires.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_324.wav|81|I would love it.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_093.wav|39|The trick is to try it.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_134.wav|107|It had been in place since last July.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_112.wav|15|Of course, it is nonsense.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_114.wav|39|Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_200.wav|107|They had not been handcuffed.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_278.wav|94|It's a way of life.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_355.wav|60|Lots of them haven't recovered that far.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_273.wav|9|I was happily surprised.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_023.wav|23|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_064.wav|82|There will be no threat to the game.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_119.wav|63|Our offer represents an attractive price for the business.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_266.wav|30|It is a time bomb.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_393.wav|52|But soon the game dropped back into its old ways.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_196.wav|78|Does the name matter ?
DUMMY2/p270/p270_069.wav|8|Both sides have been hit by injury.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_200.wav|6|It was a horrible moment.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_255.wav|52|Edinburgh Prison will also require to be seen.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_402.wav|40|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_318.wav|7|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.)
DUMMY2/p361/p361_267.wav|79|It is difficult to say.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_163.wav|93|We knew we had the goal we wanted.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_109.wav|71|"But the fans deserve to know!"
DUMMY2/p268/p268_358.wav|87|We played them off the pitch.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_262.wav|36|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_349.wav|19|It has been handled entirely properly.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_356.wav|51|We don't want to push him.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_411.wav|15|We want everyone to have a good time.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_413.wav|40|I am extremely cautious.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_140.wav|75|It's all change at Kilmarnock.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_391.wav|32|It runs until the beginning of June.)
DUMMY2/p227/p227_082.wav|29|We have to offer value for money.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_030.wav|107|It is a very special city.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_424.wav|56|Such an attack is bizarre.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_366.wav|26|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_188.wav|77|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_020.wav|103|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_309.wav|72|As in battle, the worst thing is waiting for it.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_046.wav|76|Its effect on humans is not yet known.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_345.wav|16|I've got no secret.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_206.wav|27|Tommy is not a problem.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_336.wav|45|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_331.wav|96|He was then replaced by Ross.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_084.wav|57|He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_341.wav|69|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_113.wav|100|He thought she was amazing.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_354.wav|78|Of course, it does not have to be this way.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_037.wav|100|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_051.wav|72|But they also came with a downside.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_311.wav|42|Bob Dylan's getting old.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_408.wav|22|I saw some good things.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_109.wav|53|Scotland is never far away at Westminster.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_030.wav|69|There's a story, too.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_010.wav|65|People look, but no one ever finds it. )
DUMMY2/p284/p284_131.wav|16|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_336.wav|92|This time, however, may have been different.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_319.wav|35|McNaughton was not so sure.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_312.wav|74|But it is historic.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_084.wav|58|But there was a shift.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_042.wav|24|No meaningful response was issued.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_400.wav|52|There were no hard words between us.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_221.wav|94|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_338.wav|62|It's part of your life.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_301.wav|39|So the Government will be damaged.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_159.wav|68|The inquiry had been going on for months.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_153.wav|3|That is the nature of the game.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_366.wav|94|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_018.wav|107|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_221.wav|103|But it obviously doesn't, so the government needs to intervene.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_274.wav|53|Meanwhile, the Trust presented its first grant awards for Scotland yesterday.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_468.wav|50|War is not the action.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_350.wav|89|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_089.wav|54|If so, how does it intend to achieve this result?
DUMMY2/p326/p326_341.wav|28|It would be a massive boost for them.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_327.wav|65|They emerged before the patients left hospital.)
DUMMY2/p253/p253_228.wav|70|My wife and family are the support system.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_281.wav|30|We have taken steps to rectify it.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_372.wav|40|It is hard to understand.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_237.wav|73|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_181.wav|29|I think it's a good sign.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_302.wav|89|We want to play at the worlds.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_358.wav|92|He was elected as a councillor last year.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_328.wav|106|What form did that take ?
DUMMY2/p246/p246_053.wav|5|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_182.wav|2|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_382.wav|69|At the last I found a bunker.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_032.wav|62|We have a high quality product.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_057.wav|59|None has ever been found.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_339.wav|66|They told us about it the next day.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_346.wav|92|Tyson said he had made a mistake.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_104.wav|14|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.)
DUMMY2/p317/p317_127.wav|97|Hear what they have to say.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_273.wav|5|It's a way of life.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_145.wav|15|The choice is simple.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_056.wav|74|Where is the money coming from?
DUMMY2/p287/p287_070.wav|77|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_260.wav|29|Hospitals and school building will go ahead.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_373.wav|39|They may yet have the last laugh.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_056.wav|71|"Next league matches Celtic."
DUMMY2/p307/p307_055.wav|22|Today, we begin to answer that question.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_380.wav|23|As often as not, the cause remains a mystery.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_228.wav|54|I think we will join the single currency.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_221.wav|78|It was important to win today.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_081.wav|53|I do not attempt to answer that.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_153.wav|55|how do you get it back ?
DUMMY2/p343/p343_143.wav|21|He had finally had enough.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_230.wav|30|Survival is our aim.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_178.wav|90|They took a risk.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_277.wav|67|It's a way of life.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_177.wav|9|The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_291.wav|79|I will never forget that.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_414.wav|48|It depends on Labour, not on us.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_001.wav|20|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_076.wav|44|It will be very useful for us.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_467.wav|39|Tickets will be at a premium.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_160.wav|77|Phase one was a shambles.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_170.wav|98|These days will be back.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_214.wav|73|The report is due out next month.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_068.wav|34|We were beaten by the better team today.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_075.wav|14|I was very pleased with them today, though.)
DUMMY2/p318/p318_271.wav|19|I expect a rapid response.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_049.wav|19|He was critically ill in hospital last night.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_305.wav|8|It could well be military.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_324.wav|49|You have to think not.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_012.wav|42|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_004.wav|24|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_020.wav|17|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_252.wav|99|I've had no discussions with the chairman or the board.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_181.wav|78|I was always in control.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_222.wav|35|Does the name matter ?
DUMMY2/p250/p250_466.wav|24|The boys are mentally focused.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_414.wav|65|I was the sheep.)
DUMMY2/p293/p293_052.wav|23|It is a large number.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_054.wav|8|How do you take them away ?
DUMMY2/p306/p306_106.wav|12|We are so, so lucky, so many people have died.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_324.wav|13|The whole family was in shock.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_402.wav|56|It's too close to call.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_176.wav|2|My players are special.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_236.wav|8|They all made the European Ryder Cup team.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_178.wav|83|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_010.wav|105|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_233.wav|40|The parties have been given until today to respond.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_118.wav|67|The fire was above the hole.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_129.wav|6|Look at the turn-out.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_154.wav|63|Anyone can do the sums.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_321.wav|49|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_216.wav|107|A judicial review is also being considered.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_077.wav|26|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_348.wav|31|On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_325.wav|27|It's too horrible to think.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_025.wav|20|She looked so young.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_384.wav|67|It is obvious that we are engaged in a war.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_319.wav|67|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_179.wav|0|The European Union is a case in point.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_024.wav|70|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_104.wav|24|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_027.wav|68|This was the classical period of Beethoven.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_145.wav|95|We are entirely happy with Russell.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_384.wav|69|One day, he threw the baby against a wall.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_041.wav|2|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_320.wav|1|Stevenson was arrested on Monday morning.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_370.wav|34|The pressure on the aid agencies is immense.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_095.wav|63|And does it ?
DUMMY2/p283/p283_113.wav|95|There is a contract in existence for Allan.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_208.wav|94|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_262.wav|64|THE headless man has finally developed a face.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_390.wav|11|We are all very pleased.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_246.wav|71|"I watched a game."
DUMMY2/p261/p261_141.wav|100|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_018.wav|57|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_363.wav|19|This is an internal matter.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_124.wav|23|You ask the question.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_258.wav|50|It seems a shame to leave it.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_238.wav|10|I have spoken to the skipper.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_241.wav|80|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_191.wav|66|You can feel at home in China.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_007.wav|53|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_284.wav|73|We are not going to forget.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_281.wav|31|He promised to lead from the front in battle for entry.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_116.wav|17|I'm confident we can turn things around.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_001.wav|49|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_211.wav|28|Yes, it gave me a lot of confidence.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_414.wav|38|We are here for the long term.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_382.wav|4|And the winners are.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_398.wav|58|She will just have wanted her baby.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_199.wav|64|That certainly brought me back down to earth.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_380.wav|89|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_243.wav|19|It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_130.wav|70|No production was achieved.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_262.wav|58|Also, he was flawed.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_328.wav|65|He did not say that.)
DUMMY2/p345/p345_145.wav|82|His name has not been released.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_004.wav|61|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_281.wav|13|I feel sorry for anyone coming in here.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_124.wav|24|Before the game we went for a pint.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_049.wav|96|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_263.wav|73|It's a way of life.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_366.wav|36|There will be no final dividend.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_063.wav|80|I'm just enjoying every match.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_292.wav|30|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_180.wav|23|Sadly, it took a tragedy to change things.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_013.wav|61|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_227.wav|87|He wants to be competing for titles and medals.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_293.wav|7|I'd never run for them.)
DUMMY2/p241/p241_018.wav|86|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_121.wav|98|Why does it come out now?
DUMMY2/p267/p267_196.wav|0|The conference is the first test.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_099.wav|77|He will go on the bench.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_184.wav|25|We knew nothing about it.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_188.wav|73|The service from the other players was super.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_238.wav|58|We should be trying to keep him in.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_113.wav|15|I've never felt affection for Emu.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_388.wav|76|I was released after six days.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_344.wav|51|It is a thing of beauty to watch.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_161.wav|19|I can make one further announcement.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_338.wav|38|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_288.wav|1|They were both delightful to work with.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_210.wav|59|Saturday is gone.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_343.wav|93|It is a sign of hope.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_396.wav|40|What was the difference between them?
DUMMY2/p226/p226_154.wav|43|Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_051.wav|43|It has been a horrible, horrible time.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_219.wav|4|Last night, she refused to comment on the accident.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_398.wav|10|The hope is that the outcome will be equally successful.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_277.wav|28|It will not be today, though.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_184.wav|54|The attacker died in the crash.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_125.wav|15|Both are national treasures.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_276.wav|70|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_159.wav|20|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_345.wav|74|When will this change?
DUMMY2/p227/p227_051.wav|29|The motive for the shooting was not known.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_317.wav|37|Here the picture is broadly stable.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_325.wav|75|The law will take its course.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_116.wav|51|Which perhaps is just as well.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_071.wav|72|I do not believe they are.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_206.wav|45|But I am a worried man.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_430.wav|89|The document argues that culture is at the heart of Scottish society.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_175.wav|54|I got on very well with Allan.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_328.wav|40|Finally, he paid for the movie.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_354.wav|67|Like his acting, it was an accident.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_080.wav|23|Sometimes they come off.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_119.wav|17|He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_008.wav|55|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_193.wav|74|I can't say anything.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_288.wav|30|They came into collision with Sergio.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_291.wav|70|Nothing is safe.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_354.wav|95|My life is exactly the same.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_019.wav|23|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_253.wav|27|The scene is about this?
DUMMY2/p231/p231_078.wav|50|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_017.wav|72|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_016.wav|97|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_154.wav|22|It is good for their eyesight.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_373.wav|17|There was support from across the board.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_152.wav|100|We will turn the corner.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_047.wav|66|If you have to pay for treatment, you pay for treatment.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_361.wav|67|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_171.wav|99|Waiting times for these services are too long.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_362.wav|47|That would help.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_270.wav|42|A new school will be built.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_298.wav|33|It is a very worrying report.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_142.wav|82|Scotland has lost a great man.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_301.wav|13|However, the snow was welcomed by some.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_321.wav|51|Hitches can be expected.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_042.wav|65|It is a complex deal.)
DUMMY2/p330/p330_308.wav|1|We really need research to help with that.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_093.wav|40|Hartley should know.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_098.wav|37|Maybe this battle has been.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_103.wav|104|It's a long process.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_069.wav|94|Painful, but only because it's true.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_319.wav|100|The casting is as perfect.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_368.wav|39|They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_339.wav|36|Do you think we are a top nation ?
DUMMY2/p231/p231_218.wav|50|I've wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_333.wav|18|The problem is fairly serious.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_093.wav|43|It's never too late.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_174.wav|103|She had experience of the wildest places.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_468.wav|48|The money is within the total allocation.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_153.wav|33|It certainly was a birthday to remember.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_207.wav|71|"I began to pray."
DUMMY2/p330/p330_011.wav|1|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_321.wav|7|The circumstances have changed since last year.)
DUMMY2/p303/p303_016.wav|44|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_074.wav|46|I think we will join the single currency.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_355.wav|15|It will take time.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_058.wav|1|I think they should have more respect.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_013.wav|56|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_286.wav|3|Is our children learning ?
DUMMY2/p226/p226_114.wav|43|It was really enjoyable on Saturday.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_115.wav|0|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
DUMMY2/p247/p247_023.wav|14|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. )
DUMMY2/p260/p260_115.wav|81|It is so sad.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_293.wav|72|She says she has grown up.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_064.wav|107|Both these events occurred on Wednesday night.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_191.wav|92|I need a publishing deal!
DUMMY2/p257/p257_069.wav|105|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_227.wav|53|This takes no account of hotel and tourism losses.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_061.wav|59|Hopefully, we have learned a lot from that game.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_024.wav|0|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_077.wav|40|I will miss him.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_098.wav|44|She is on a life support machine.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_021.wav|62|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increase as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_328.wav|53|He is not exactly a pretty child.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_185.wav|68|The guys have really enjoyed it.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_355.wav|100|To beat the European champion is quite nice.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_287.wav|76|The end result is precisely the same.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_298.wav|3|Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_227.wav|27|Clearly, the stakes are high.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_297.wav|63|He's been here on numerous occasions.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_378.wav|62|We are very nearly there.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_271.wav|60|That was six years ago.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_093.wav|76|There's also the point.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_350.wav|20|I believe the gap is nearly there.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_253.wav|96|I was certainly wrong with my prediction of the result.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_315.wav|44|We couldn't go very fast.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_083.wav|68|His parenthood is called into question.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_285.wav|38|I will never manage another Scottish club.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_171.wav|68|It's just that we see different things.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_153.wav|41|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_026.wav|20|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_213.wav|36|This is a holy place.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_137.wav|17|People can describe a moment in their life.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_053.wav|101|I have made that offer.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_177.wav|78|They have not been named.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_129.wav|29|And I have some advice for my old friend.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_346.wav|19|My heart is not so sure.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_252.wav|2|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_072.wav|8|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_103.wav|100|Our house was very small.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_248.wav|61|Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_243.wav|66|One must hope not!
DUMMY2/p255/p255_209.wav|31|It's all about money, money, money.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_009.wav|87|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_223.wav|59|They should come forward.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_127.wav|36|Twaddle is a case in point.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_088.wav|40|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_341.wav|48|Friends said he had suffered a blackout two weeks ago.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_201.wav|80|We have to recognise that he is an elusive character.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_345.wav|12|So we shall remain vigilant, and keep the pressure on him.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_345.wav|86|I could hardly move for the next couple of days.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_170.wav|39|Neither side can win this war.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_279.wav|3|However, no further action was taken by police.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_064.wav|44|Seven children had lost both parents.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_298.wav|92|Ferguson is not interested in the finances.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_230.wav|0|The boy is no longer with us.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_228.wav|2|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_284.wav|6|It was quite a sight.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_035.wav|60|He would not have to explain.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_104.wav|30|Early warnings could help, but it's a scary thought.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_460.wav|39|It has been a waste of time.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_338.wav|1|It's annoying in a way.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_159.wav|29|He was in great spirits.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_160.wav|40|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_235.wav|83|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_150.wav|48|The move follows a review of the Singapore
DUMMY2/p269/p269_187.wav|94|They will run a mile.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_223.wav|5|I didn't play too well in the third quarter.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_103.wav|65|The referee had been right.)
DUMMY2/p276/p276_012.wav|106|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_381.wav|68|So too Eriksson, as yet unbeaten on his travels with England.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_194.wav|28|It's just the workings of the Scottish media.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_343.wav|8|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
DUMMY2/p246/p246_285.wav|5|But I've won both ways.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_156.wav|105|There's a sense of excess in the novel.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_411.wav|103|ALL IS busy but not much is happening.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_012.wav|16|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_328.wav|1|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_169.wav|86|It is too much for me.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_289.wav|46|My wife is totally behind me on this.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_161.wav|12|You should be there with six different characters.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_241.wav|41|They are all bright and different.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_315.wav|58|Surrey police said no body had been found.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_251.wav|30|We are not out of touch with politics.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_317.wav|22|I look for dancers who are also actors.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_120.wav|12|However, it very nearly all went wrong.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_039.wav|23|It's a sensible management decision.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_132.wav|8|Is there a waiting list ?
DUMMY2/p261/p261_213.wav|100|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_253.wav|30|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_026.wav|75|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_236.wav|86|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_280.wav|23|Yesterday her family were too upset to speak.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_198.wav|33|He invented the language.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_122.wav|39|The problem was a social problem.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_320.wav|42|There are different cultures in different departments.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_188.wav|100|That is a waste of energy.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_273.wav|41|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_411.wav|36|One day, he threw the baby against a wall.
