DUMMY2/p334/p334_214.wav|38|The approval system will be changed.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_019.wav|7|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. )
DUMMY2/p279/p279_278.wav|25|It happens from time to time.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_195.wav|56|I won't make an official complaint.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_156.wav|95|I am just trying to do my job.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_388.wav|98|I was quietly confident about getting the win.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_212.wav|33|That's the most important thing for me.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_174.wav|66|They will know they deserve to be there.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_067.wav|53|He was failed by his health authority.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_315.wav|41|It is a strong case.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_194.wav|22|I hate to say it, but you can understand it.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_073.wav|72|Clearly, there will have to be changes.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_488.wav|48|Holland won by five wickets.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_294.wav|14|It was never a free kick.)
DUMMY2/p264/p264_126.wav|65|An announcement is expected within a few months.)
DUMMY2/p311/p311_110.wav|4|It is not really used by many people.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_371.wav|74|He was not entirely correct.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_174.wav|57|The post will be unpaid.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_347.wav|87|After the match, do you ?
DUMMY2/p277/p277_017.wav|89|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_150.wav|72|It will be easier for us.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_360.wav|97|I am saddened to hear of the accident.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_078.wav|55|So is that it, then ?
DUMMY2/p262/p262_150.wav|45|They were later discharged from hospital.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_064.wav|80|And a film maker was born.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_173.wav|4|This is a very interesting move.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_187.wav|106|This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_341.wav|93|Who was the mystery MP?
DUMMY2/p270/p270_108.wav|8|We deserve a significant rise.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_334.wav|89|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_229.wav|53|I want to see as much progress as possible.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_119.wav|28|She has now been registered as disabled.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_270.wav|4|He said he was delighted by the award.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_308.wav|42|I can understand why they have gone.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_042.wav|98|I should say so.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_224.wav|87|IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_175.wav|59|Mr Kennedy is not a candidate for the Scottish Parliament.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_406.wav|105|But they are still unlikely to be involved in combat.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_405.wav|103|They've been here before.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_087.wav|3|So is that it, then ?
DUMMY2/p262/p262_093.wav|45|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_241.wav|37|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_241.wav|96|It's quite nice.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_114.wav|4|It is nearly there.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_165.wav|35|Nobody did in those days.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_001.wav|1|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_120.wav|65|It came a bit late.)
DUMMY2/p274/p274_120.wav|32|There is no evidence that these people are helpful.)
DUMMY2/p340/p340_358.wav|74|The time was right.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_220.wav|84|In each case they were a goal down.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_404.wav|62|If so, they were wrong.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_035.wav|49|If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_366.wav|17|I had some time with Aston Villa.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_066.wav|16|And if he hadn't become a musician?
DUMMY2/p283/p283_143.wav|95|You've got to be vigilant.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_229.wav|20|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_047.wav|40|Among them are many criminals.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_037.wav|54|Who has he fought?
DUMMY2/p323/p323_062.wav|34|This is the place to play football.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_262.wav|93|So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_343.wav|7|Shareholders will be asked to approve a new replacement scheme.)
DUMMY2/p260/p260_167.wav|81|Does that put pressure on us?
DUMMY2/p343/p343_294.wav|21|He had a decision to make.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_165.wav|60|We're very unhappy about it.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_397.wav|77|Safety was also an issue.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_105.wav|60|I am looking forward to it.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_060.wav|99|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_208.wav|84|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_014.wav|68|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_267.wav|67|The warning is timely.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_408.wav|40|Domestic Disturbance is currently on general release.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_269.wav|7|What form did that take ?)
DUMMY2/p308/p308_089.wav|107|It's a flourishing and beautiful city.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_114.wav|61|I came to complete.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_108.wav|83|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_287.wav|51|The first eviction takes place on Sunday.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_180.wav|78|It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_220.wav|72|A spokesman refused to confirm the figure.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_326.wav|56|Other musicians were found in retirement.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_106.wav|62|The Rangers think they have problems.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_165.wav|8|This action reflects a slump in bookings.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_343.wav|11|It's a great idea.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_172.wav|79|It is a very demanding course.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_053.wav|35|Four other charges were dropped.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_063.wav|83|It happened so quickly.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_325.wav|28|You see, my back has gone.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_131.wav|53|He's got to look after himself now.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_010.wav|92|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_064.wav|56|I was as strong as a horse.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_121.wav|35|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_119.wav|104|We have now no choice.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_423.wav|40|It's been a long, long journey.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_197.wav|24|Aberdeen had little to offer.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_237.wav|56|Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_132.wav|35|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_116.wav|23|PR for Westminster is their holy grail.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_164.wav|27|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_265.wav|13|As far as Scotland is concerned, he should relax.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_196.wav|32|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.)
DUMMY2/p231/p231_046.wav|50|I was inspired by two things.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_114.wav|56|We would make a start.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_053.wav|47|It's very odd.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_277.wav|88|And now he has decided, enough.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_298.wav|25|What has altered?
DUMMY2/p340/p340_336.wav|74|I think we have got the balance right.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_363.wav|99|They have not done so this season so far.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_389.wav|17|I never agreed with that.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_210.wav|54|It will only work with changes in lifestyle.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_150.wav|74|He is advised that he has done so.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_042.wav|78|And they had a case.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_243.wav|79|It's a technical demand.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_306.wav|53|Are you going to win ?
DUMMY2/p303/p303_121.wav|44|They will know they deserve to be there.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_238.wav|26|Hospitals are for the ill.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_061.wav|56|I was conceived in Aberdeen.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_002.wav|82|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_250.wav|98|That does not mean we have failed.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_292.wav|42|He looked at me before replying.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_343.wav|95|It became a book by itself.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_331.wav|1|Yet the data is compelling.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_114.wav|10|I didn't think so either.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_003.wav|97|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_110.wav|13|There could still be some to come forward.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_226.wav|52|If not, a deal could take many months.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_280.wav|82|We can build on that.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_245.wav|1|He loved his job and working in newspapers.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_233.wav|45|A succession of managers in the opera company resigned.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_011.wav|82|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_281.wav|18|I think it has worked.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_126.wav|53|So I am going in the right direction.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_339.wav|5|Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_175.wav|85|I have never seen him like that.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_219.wav|27|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_421.wav|39|Today, the story is different.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_126.wav|42|Which brings us to the question of money.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_262.wav|83|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_050.wav|5|She looked so young.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_325.wav|44|I wanted, really, to deal with two opposite energies.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_001.wav|16|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_022.wav|53|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_268.wav|16|It's a way of life.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_102.wav|74|His own excitement is never difficult to detect.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_358.wav|10|A crucial moment has arrived.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_044.wav|106|This is slightly negative for inflation.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_045.wav|18|he told a producer.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_164.wav|15|It was his greatest movie performance.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_273.wav|87|A warning may be sufficient to reform behaviour.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_142.wav|87|The tribunal said his conduct was wholly reprehensible.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_093.wav|21|They were going through the motions, but that's about all.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_214.wav|90|The FBI could become involved.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_088.wav|94|By then, he was walking on water.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_335.wav|93|The police have to act to help them.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_201.wav|100|It was a moment of madness.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_364.wav|49|It may encourage more people to prospect.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_303.wav|61|Who can predict ?
DUMMY2/p271/p271_093.wav|27|Maloney is an engaging talent.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_124.wav|46|They will do their own thing.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_345.wav|11|I have been struggling with my form.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_409.wav|50|How do you take them away ?
DUMMY2/p312/p312_088.wav|62|Either system could have prevented the crash.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_290.wav|91|Everything has been destroyed.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_025.wav|5|He has not been named.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_317.wav|20|We are a peaceful people.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_421.wav|54|Women reported more depression than men.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_076.wav|23|More than half of the school collapsed.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_122.wav|35|Something will be done by corporate bodies.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_421.wav|56|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_165.wav|95|Are you going to win ?
DUMMY2/p280/p280_193.wav|52|It involved everything in terms of behaviour.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_328.wav|69|I've got no secret.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_415.wav|17|The film is about the cost of genius.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_409.wav|76|He deserves a top team.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_303.wav|12|I'm wondering what you feel about the youngest.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_283.wav|57|She said she could not believe that they had run away.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_150.wav|70|There was a substantial explosion.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_226.wav|49|Both sides have to step back.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_294.wav|76|That, though, is to miss the point.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_254.wav|8|This is a historic occasion.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_483.wav|48|Again the parallel with football can be drawn.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_011.wav|56|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_350.wav|53|I think the guilty ones speak for the whole lot of us.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_165.wav|34|We tried everything, but it just wasn't to be today.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_032.wav|69|He was jailed for five years.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_272.wav|25|That could be in place by next year.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_249.wav|76|We should be rewarded for producing.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_103.wav|23|These guys are looking for business.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_010.wav|63|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_069.wav|74|We were very close.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_072.wav|90|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_413.wav|65|Williams said the same.)
DUMMY2/p249/p249_109.wav|80|It is a good day for the coalition.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_044.wav|54|Both reports appeared in the British Medical Journal.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_148.wav|42|Next league matches, Dundee United Rangers.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_064.wav|23|Why did it take a concerted campaign?
DUMMY2/p286/p286_112.wav|63|He was forced to quit.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_304.wav|52|Had I heard ?
DUMMY2/p275/p275_151.wav|40|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_186.wav|45|That would be my view.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_207.wav|75|My duty is to win.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_326.wav|43|The airport was even different.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_370.wav|13|And how he kept his word.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_249.wav|97|Just get on with your job.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_338.wav|44|I'm very sad and deeply shocked.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_222.wav|38|The list is too long for this piece.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_346.wav|98|He wouldn't do it.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_228.wav|45|However, no further action was taken by police.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_290.wav|104|It's a blunt instrument anyway.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_042.wav|35|People want to see me on the screen.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_402.wav|0|Is there a waiting list ?
DUMMY2/p237/p237_122.wav|61|It is a delight on every level.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_209.wav|4|There has also been some Scots input.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_324.wav|18|The number never came.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_190.wav|60|What could we do?
DUMMY2/p330/p330_078.wav|1|The way ahead is not easy.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_139.wav|48|It is the only practical access for vehicles and men.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_126.wav|35|We must recognise that this outfit is unique.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_278.wav|36|For him then it's a labour of love.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_272.wav|42|And it had been a marvellous occasion.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_004.wav|18|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_046.wav|35|If not, he should go home.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_216.wav|17|I'm back playing football, which is what it's all about.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_171.wav|35|Manchester United can win the European Cup this season.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_136.wav|64|YOU thought it was a headache.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_040.wav|96|Dancing was her life.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_133.wav|62|She was extremely rigid.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_168.wav|47|They thought they had found a home.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_281.wav|40|You've got to have both sides.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_264.wav|60|I don't intend to do so now.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_432.wav|37|It was like the old days.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_064.wav|37|He will need that machine.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_025.wav|61|He said the matter had been neglected in the past.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_165.wav|24|It has become a way of life.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_056.wav|43|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_092.wav|69|By then, he was walking on water.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_276.wav|15|That's a very serious matter.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_278.wav|48|Our destiny is in our own hands.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_155.wav|106|Gordon Marshall was outstanding against us.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_348.wav|14|Had this been common practice ?)
DUMMY2/p326/p326_154.wav|28|A new school will be built.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_108.wav|3|In London today, it was business as usual.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_285.wav|49|The company yesterday refused to comment.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_378.wav|0|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_150.wav|38|Why is that?
DUMMY2/p293/p293_399.wav|23|Green is desperate to play in The Open.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_098.wav|23|And he's the first to see that, and say that.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_115.wav|44|I'd like to take the plunge.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_281.wav|17|THE atmosphere was electric.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_366.wav|16|Mentally, you have to be tough.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_132.wav|63|They will remember this victory for a while.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_062.wav|23|So they will settle again.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_119.wav|70|It is rubbish.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_078.wav|58|Robert is a special talent.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_194.wav|94|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_302.wav|35|He is at war with his knee.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_288.wav|83|I was the sheep.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_215.wav|98|What has changed?
DUMMY2/p269/p269_255.wav|94|I can't get a job.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_392.wav|42|This is the real thing now.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_181.wav|22|This does not create any precedent.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_229.wav|21|As it was a double, it was pretty expensive.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_325.wav|76|Players are fighting to stay in the team.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_074.wav|50|Both men were on one-year contracts.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_200.wav|22|They tend to be easily influenced by others.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_199.wav|29|He made no order on costs.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_295.wav|18|Even then he wanted to deflect attention.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_396.wav|25|You ask the question.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_192.wav|38|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_034.wav|45|Life was like a timetable.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_414.wav|39|Once again, they were back amongst the big boys.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_271.wav|88|Last season was very hard for me.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_149.wav|87|Dumfries and Galloway Council said it was not breaking the Government's directions.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_414.wav|74|It means a huge amount.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_119.wav|50|It is a delight on every level.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_228.wav|40|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_302.wav|6|It was not the right time for me.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_492.wav|24|These people attack the core of my beliefs.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_137.wav|103|I felt under no pressure today.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_357.wav|51|I like what has happened!
DUMMY2/p334/p334_168.wav|38|The fate of large numbers remains unknown.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_388.wav|68|The damage from the fire was huge.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_288.wav|44|It was rather a distorted image of Islam.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_112.wav|42|We are just being flooded.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_101.wav|12|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_236.wav|73|I WAS certainly wrong with my prediction of the result.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_276.wav|16|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_387.wav|24|Does it matter ?
DUMMY2/p360/p360_181.wav|60|We are really impressed.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_166.wav|22|However, who could have predicted this result?
DUMMY2/p265/p265_197.wav|73|I don't want to use it.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_192.wav|96|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_268.wav|38|I may think about performing it.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_028.wav|92|Because we do not need it.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_378.wav|29|Alex Ferguson is the same.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_390.wav|67|There were no casualties.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_376.wav|102|The mix with Tiger is perfect.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_117.wav|93|I joined a group.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_122.wav|71|"Death is outside the language."
DUMMY2/p318/p318_248.wav|19|I thought they could have made the gesture.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_061.wav|14|What do we do ?)
DUMMY2/p274/p274_109.wav|32|This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.)
DUMMY2/p231/p231_367.wav|50|You need a licence to run a pub.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_194.wav|104|You can't get a mortgage.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_067.wav|77|Both sides have been hit by injury.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_032.wav|96|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_068.wav|66|Where is the human rights?
DUMMY2/p329/p329_179.wav|103|It is too early to speculate.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_325.wav|7|We would hope to make progress on that next year.)
DUMMY2/p300/p300_388.wav|102|A century on, little has changed.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_054.wav|22|Here he is, in effect, appointing himself a judge.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_179.wav|84|And I was happy for the happiness of my brothers.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_279.wav|53|Yesterday's session was the last full one before Christmas.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_239.wav|80|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_233.wav|39|In each case they were a goal down.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_271.wav|13|The company reacted very, very well.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_239.wav|91|These guys will not lie down.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_296.wav|70|They are wrong.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_400.wav|37|Clearly, the IRA has got away with murder.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_094.wav|48|But I had never been in a theatre.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_246.wav|19|We haven't come out of this very well.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_176.wav|35|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_047.wav|100|It had little effect on European equity markets.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_105.wav|65|It would be easy to think so.)
DUMMY2/p270/p270_438.wav|8|It would be very dangerous.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_187.wav|25|It's a joke.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_158.wav|8|Do you think we are a top nation ?
DUMMY2/p292/p292_314.wav|13|They said that they stood by their statement.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_109.wav|22|Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_168.wav|68|Can they be serious?
DUMMY2/p239/p239_152.wav|48|Since then, things have improved.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_091.wav|0|Our house was very small.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_374.wav|33|It may be down, but New York is not out.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_115.wav|54|Each day is a new beginning.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_123.wav|0|Nobody in the world can get away from him.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_336.wav|17|The Olympic committee should be ashamed of themselves.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_404.wav|34|Ms Jackson was not at the meeting.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_105.wav|35|It is close to call.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_357.wav|28|My husband was born in Zimbabwe.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_073.wav|69|He was popular.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_126.wav|95|It was won on the issue of the land.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_348.wav|102|It is a simple equation.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_079.wav|60|The voters rejected us.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_123.wav|25|We work on the same level.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_100.wav|25|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_060.wav|28|Yesterday's performance was exactly that.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_174.wav|21|That began as an accident.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_187.wav|11|I know nothing about that.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_107.wav|44|Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_068.wav|7|It is a job creation scheme.)
DUMMY2/p316/p316_130.wav|85|The following are the principal provisions.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_260.wav|42|I'm the one who has to suffer.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_168.wav|55|Health experts said they were not surprised by the findings.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_216.wav|58|They were both very brave.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_099.wav|76|He wouldn't allow that to happen.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_353.wav|0|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_265.wav|62|I said How much?
DUMMY2/p339/p339_267.wav|18|That's the important thing.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_226.wav|1|We're going to see more extreme weather.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_315.wav|28|We're looking at the Citizens Theatre the Lyceum.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_093.wav|96|However, it did not end that way.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_313.wav|72|It added to the reverence.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_327.wav|102|It may also be her last.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_207.wav|99|Now, it's all right.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_128.wav|64|It is an interesting title, Believing in Britain.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_301.wav|91|But he was a full, working member of our staff.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_401.wav|79|It was cynical and callous.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_197.wav|63|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_303.wav|7|We're trying to get rounded performers.)
DUMMY2/p258/p258_061.wav|26|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_382.wav|36|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_037.wav|20|Indeed, he does.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_153.wav|71|"It was deployed in the Gulf War."
DUMMY2/p362/p362_122.wav|15|I got the surprise of my life.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_236.wav|106|Bottling is now the core business.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_009.wav|37|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_008.wav|91|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_152.wav|25|A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_274.wav|35|We feel very good about it.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_239.wav|76|I was an athlete.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_007.wav|45|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_072.wav|44|What do they pay to join the club?
DUMMY2/p274/p274_222.wav|32|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.)
DUMMY2/p323/p323_418.wav|34|We tend to come good at the end.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_398.wav|26|He is on the wrong side.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_177.wav|43|I took the gun.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_237.wav|107|I had a sense of deja vu.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_458.wav|36|Both promotions come as no surprise.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_222.wav|22|This makes no sense!
DUMMY2/p294/p294_173.wav|104|It was little else.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_407.wav|49|There was no cohesion.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_084.wav|11|There is no question of dithering.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_337.wav|12|Instead they were openly attempting to be helpful.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_325.wav|69|Well, it won't.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_260.wav|21|And they are different.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_251.wav|9|The perception is that we do not care about social issues.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_224.wav|48|But it's an enjoyable job.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_293.wav|15|There are other things going on.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_099.wav|72|I live on the streets of Glasgow.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_017.wav|98|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_277.wav|64|Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_185.wav|3|He called for a public inquiry.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_400.wav|107|The Master was by then just too old.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_256.wav|17|Investment in quality, service and marketing were the only way forward.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_130.wav|46|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_310.wav|82|That goes back a long way.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_059.wav|80|It will take time.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_181.wav|21|I've got a young family.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_050.wav|44|I saw them not long after it happened.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_115.wav|78|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_211.wav|4|There is certainly no single outstanding candidate.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_178.wav|2|The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_082.wav|25|Both sides have been hit by injury.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_273.wav|27|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_218.wav|47|We've got the bronze.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_099.wav|100|No, the equipment is extra.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_296.wav|102|After that he became more romantic.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_157.wav|17|Last night the bombardment was terrible.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_144.wav|56|So what is the campaign about ?
DUMMY2/p293/p293_108.wav|23|It didn't help him, as far as we had seen.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_376.wav|8|He must have seen the movie.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_079.wav|73|It will be tight.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_359.wav|79|So far, it is no more.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_148.wav|93|Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_263.wav|92|It was seriously unpleasant.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_129.wav|61|She really suffered for her art.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_107.wav|8|Scotland will be an integral part of Abbey National.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_356.wav|63|Whether this return was too soon.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_229.wav|89|But it's a subtle process.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_217.wav|22|They were later discharged from hospital.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_401.wav|69|What was the difference between them?
DUMMY2/p323/p323_384.wav|34|The idea has potential for the future.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_264.wav|101|That should be the subject matter of a public debate.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_167.wav|67|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_013.wav|11|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_156.wav|53|No contact was made, although the arm was clearly raised.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_432.wav|75|Paris is not only young.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_391.wav|37|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_303.wav|57|This wasn't the way it was supposed to be.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_325.wav|96|Off with their heads.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_128.wav|82|She has left the island.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_013.wav|93|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_007.wav|25|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_401.wav|98|Are you all right?
DUMMY2/p297/p297_189.wav|42|News of the funding was broadly welcomed yesterday.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_090.wav|2|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_160.wav|102|She collapsed and died a day later.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_043.wav|7|Several investments have already been made.)
DUMMY2/p262/p262_376.wav|45|Something is wrong.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_276.wav|2|She looked so young.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_103.wav|34|He could look after himself, but didn't.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_233.wav|54|Nine of the tourists were killed instantly.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_383.wav|37|So is that it, then ?
DUMMY2/p237/p237_259.wav|61|You can feel at home in China.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_009.wav|5|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_183.wav|97|And the World Cup has not even begun.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_159.wav|34|I got off to a great start.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_030.wav|73|It's a fact.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_272.wav|26|Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_413.wav|75|He is on the wrong side.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_116.wav|41|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_264.wav|54|He put some colour into Scottish history.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_296.wav|72|It makes no sense.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_138.wav|58|In time, may prove a worthy successor to Billy Dodds.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_273.wav|73|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_192.wav|46|My ambitions are still with football.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_099.wav|35|It has been a nightmare of frustration.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_298.wav|57|It's certainly different.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_151.wav|31|He sets the nature of his Parliament in simple, realistic context.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_030.wav|83|This is the window.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_284.wav|60|They tend to be female and retired.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_299.wav|14|The circumstances have changed since last year.)
DUMMY2/p293/p293_371.wav|23|It didn't work against Sweden, but that was the intention.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_006.wav|56|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_136.wav|90|Our intentions are real.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_156.wav|100|These days are long gone.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_436.wav|27|The document argues that culture is at the heart of Scottish society.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_244.wav|41|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_225.wav|34|That was the case with David.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_171.wav|89|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_459.wav|100|It all began as an accident.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_105.wav|75|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_025.wav|8|He was afraid to stay in hospital in Kosovo.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_318.wav|12|Too often it is not.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_333.wav|48|And they haven't taken the foot off the gas.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_143.wav|103|Last night the bombardment was terrible.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_023.wav|2|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_097.wav|17|It is a difficult thing to explain.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_269.wav|107|Three years probation is just a joke.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_273.wav|31|This is a question of Islam.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_250.wav|54|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_265.wav|78|However, no further action was taken by police.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_344.wav|52|Martin O Neill called this game almost exactly right.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_385.wav|42|One might think that is a power.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_311.wav|55|Many events are down on numbers.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_349.wav|31|That is a break with tradition.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_230.wav|69|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_295.wav|15|So who is right?
DUMMY2/p334/p334_102.wav|38|Hopefully, we have learned a lot from that game.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_074.wav|12|What are you supposed to do, just walk away?
DUMMY2/p273/p273_302.wav|56|Holland won by five wickets.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_210.wav|90|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_164.wav|1|Sure the COE is a cracking band.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_041.wav|80|Sure, it's funny.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_248.wav|14|Three weeks later, he resigned.)
DUMMY2/p238/p238_248.wav|37|It would seem a natural progression.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_001.wav|45|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_113.wav|85|I've tried to get on with my life.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_365.wav|6|It has certainly not been an enjoyable experience.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_381.wav|70|It's a real problem.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_135.wav|10|But he admitted he could not speak for the new owner.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_175.wav|18|This was much worse.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_259.wav|28|I'd love to have been on the pitch.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_152.wav|21|It always had to be about the gym.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_099.wav|29|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_168.wav|12|Four policemen were wounded.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_270.wav|106|My Dad is a hero.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_215.wav|57|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_126.wav|74|We are in the end game.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_342.wav|11|So what is their secret?
DUMMY2/p343/p343_313.wav|21|The children continue to talk to us.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_080.wav|98|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_067.wav|94|We have to be sure that the taxation system can work.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_165.wav|46|They won the trophy in the Hoops.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_389.wav|78|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_067.wav|80|Scotland had great assets.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_073.wav|51|You can't go on forever.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_085.wav|36|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_271.wav|94|The government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_265.wav|89|It's a way of life.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_128.wav|75|You are a gambling man.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_096.wav|24|Why do it otherwise ?
DUMMY2/p363/p363_388.wav|6|I am enjoying it.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_332.wav|53|I felt it was time for me to leave to develop my career.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_009.wav|95|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_345.wav|29|The king is delighted by the honour.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_197.wav|22|I want him to take on Gomez.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_280.wav|21|He is not a pathetic figure.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_036.wav|55|We've got a real battle now with Richard.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_382.wav|20|Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_409.wav|74|It will not be easy.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_409.wav|52|The play was to go straight ahead.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_123.wav|44|In that case, we would be prepared to defend ourselves.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_285.wav|88|I certainly hope so.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_317.wav|69|Is there a new way forward?
DUMMY2/p285/p285_278.wav|2|He looked very sharp.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_372.wav|91|His job was not advertised.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_178.wav|35|Tomorrow is a new day.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_087.wav|87|We will pay their bills.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_020.wav|15|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_365.wav|101|You did not see it.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_045.wav|55|The youngsters have put us in a strong position.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_218.wav|56|You could feel the heat.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_386.wav|45|We're looking for justice.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_105.wav|105|I didn't play well last year.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_329.wav|28|It had been on the cards.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_049.wav|37|It comes from reflection or thinking.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_056.wav|97|That tells you something about them.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_033.wav|11|I will always remember the horrible images.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_248.wav|73|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_424.wav|34|I want him to take on Gomez.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_406.wav|78|There is a demand for it.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_449.wav|7|None of the pieces was commissioned.)
DUMMY2/p293/p293_259.wav|23|I find the whole affair disturbing.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_134.wav|60|And this game is all about belief.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_216.wav|4|It can be halted.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_057.wav|81|What was the main difference?
DUMMY2/p302/p302_144.wav|30|You were the kidnappers.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_034.wav|22|I kept my side of the bargain.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_018.wav|104|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_037.wav|0|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_167.wav|36|They will do their own thing.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_320.wav|48|I have been very nervous.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_196.wav|12|The FBI could become involved.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_212.wav|17|Just see where the blood is coming from.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_011.wav|16|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_378.wav|38|Here we have not had one hour.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_336.wav|22|Birthdays are wonderful and terrible things.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_019.wav|66|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_121.wav|32|That is far too high.)
DUMMY2/p313/p313_312.wav|76|I'm not a paedophile.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_376.wav|104|Social workers are on stand-by to help.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_188.wav|24|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_395.wav|74|It wasn't the second one.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_026.wav|65|I've got the same feeling as I had last week in Germany.)
DUMMY2/p362/p362_171.wav|15|Do we want to see it?
DUMMY2/p273/p273_194.wav|56|Little is known about them.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_019.wav|17|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_296.wav|60|I believe it will happen.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_284.wav|19|It's funny how it comes and goes.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_256.wav|20|Chelsea was a great club.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_238.wav|88|We just do not do it.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_008.wav|83|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_056.wav|80|It's very odd.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_194.wav|14|They were seriously after him.)
DUMMY2/p361/p361_107.wav|79|Music is all consuming.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_080.wav|46|No-one said anything to me.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_091.wav|46|This is my life.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_091.wav|89|Someone who cares
DUMMY2/p252/p252_104.wav|55|The idea is the shop within a shop.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_015.wav|75|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_132.wav|22|She was making a living, but her career was going nowhere.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_357.wav|39|The pain was almost too much to bear.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_275.wav|22|I'd say we should give it a week.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_213.wav|102|It is like being a qualifier again.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_050.wav|20|There was a substantial explosion.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_316.wav|80|In fact, they have the opposite effect.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_355.wav|74|I just did not cope with the pressure.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_133.wav|94|Twaddle is a case in point.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_219.wav|80|There was an e-mail.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_281.wav|33|The criminal justice system doesn't deliver.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_014.wav|106|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_107.wav|82|I was going to help with the dinner.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_085.wav|9|We have turned the corner.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_264.wav|43|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_075.wav|92|This time, there were no such rewards.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_466.wav|48|Several hundred people attended yesterday.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_371.wav|15|We need to increase the membership.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_256.wav|27|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_133.wav|46|It is never an easy game.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_071.wav|105|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_018.wav|6|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_072.wav|106|There was no safety net.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_276.wav|38|This is a lie.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_188.wav|47|The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_119.wav|65|Trading is tough at the moment.)
DUMMY2/p340/p340_046.wav|74|It would be another reason to live.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_110.wav|27|She reflects a bit.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_267.wav|57|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_185.wav|55|Maybe this battle had been.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_018.wav|71|"Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. "
DUMMY2/p361/p361_343.wav|79|I have a cold.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_031.wav|107|It has been blown out of all proportion.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_208.wav|77|From there, they can go anywhere.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_383.wav|75|A review is under way.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_413.wav|35|Even if they come out playing a physical game, we can cope.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_307.wav|93|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_180.wav|60|I could easy do that.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_266.wav|65|Everyone wanted him to win.)
DUMMY2/p257/p257_347.wav|105|His legal adviser was also not in court yesterday.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_320.wav|19|Then came the crunch.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_252.wav|82|Actually, it's an amazing orchestra.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_332.wav|65|Sources yesterday said the Royal Bank has declined to back him.)
DUMMY2/p297/p297_091.wav|42|Craig is a major concern for us.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_163.wav|3|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_399.wav|105|We have just got to keep his feet on the ground.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_241.wav|84|A succession of managers in the opera company resigned.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_346.wav|89|As, indeed, they would be.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_058.wav|93|However the drama was still not at an end.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_084.wav|33|She was also very brave.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_086.wav|16|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_348.wav|32|There was some merit in that.)
DUMMY2/p246/p246_010.wav|5|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_393.wav|33|The research was my life.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_319.wav|74|One is investment, one is reform.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_015.wav|20|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_024.wav|76|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_022.wav|97|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_106.wav|94|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_034.wav|10|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_177.wav|65|Once again, he refused.)
DUMMY2/p272/p272_353.wav|69|There was a substantial explosion.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_266.wav|48|He is not a pathetic figure.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_105.wav|21|Many others are subjected to violence by men.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_314.wav|33|There is good quality.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_210.wav|6|I wanted to have a go.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_066.wav|58|The decision is an absolute disgrace.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_188.wav|27|I've been there.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_138.wav|15|He has created the confusion.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_374.wav|18|It shows the Government is listening.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_362.wav|52|He's young enough and he must learn.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_402.wav|10|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_161.wav|85|The four characters could be one somebody suggested.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_147.wav|35|I am not going to make any further comment, apart from that.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_381.wav|77|It's as wide as a church in here.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_373.wav|97|He planned to relocate to Scotland, probably Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_260.wav|104|I haven't a clue.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_251.wav|51|You cannot allow it to go on.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_156.wav|28|It is worse because she suffers from angina.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_396.wav|76|Of course, it is a tough assignment.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_081.wav|42|You have to do your research.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_075.wav|19|I'm so worried about the roads.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_043.wav|87|Why do it otherwise ?
DUMMY2/p323/p323_373.wav|34|PR will be just one of them.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_371.wav|70|I'm still an amateur in that sense.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_004.wav|39|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_164.wav|80|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_295.wav|50|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_137.wav|10|Before it was an ordeal.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_246.wav|35|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_140.wav|97|Actors stand still in the frame.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_005.wav|93|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_131.wav|11|I was very fortunate.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_220.wav|103|Four people died instantly.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_148.wav|99|It is like a football team.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_258.wav|53|Despite his success, things began to fall apart.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_382.wav|45|It would be a massive boost for them.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_247.wav|106|That group reported just before Christmas.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_265.wav|10|No production contract is yet in sight.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_132.wav|106|The Queen Mother is dead.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_350.wav|21|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_311.wav|80|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_267.wav|1|That end is enjoying life, as far as David is concerned.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_222.wav|33|His was the best performance of the day, after all.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_258.wav|33|The ministers are now to make their decision.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_207.wav|45|There was an e-mail.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_245.wav|33|Haven't been so lucky since.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_165.wav|55|They have shown great character.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_101.wav|32|Our house was very small.)
DUMMY2/p257/p257_240.wav|105|It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_081.wav|11|and their remit is limited.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_183.wav|86|Four policemen were wounded.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_177.wav|87|The upturn in the housing market has given a big boost.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_167.wav|56|Hopefully, it will bring new customers.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_395.wav|34|He already had had complaints.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_164.wav|11|We're very proud of him and his achievement.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_288.wav|63|The stage was set for a showdown.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_415.wav|0|He is on the wrong side.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_119.wav|13|I was influenced by all of these things.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_465.wav|14|Phil Mickelson did that last year.)
DUMMY2/p329/p329_161.wav|103|It will be a great night.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_216.wav|9|Twaddle is a case in point.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_106.wav|74|He didn't bother a soul.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_119.wav|31|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_293.wav|0|We have a plan in place.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_249.wav|105|I watched a game.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_185.wav|33|He needed a kidney - it is as simple as that.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_297.wav|12|There is bound to be a formal complaint.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_390.wav|104|We have other options.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_071.wav|55|This is a great opportunity for us.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_049.wav|104|We've all done it!
DUMMY2/p269/p269_072.wav|94|There could be a way back.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_002.wav|8|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_120.wav|60|I'm not thinking about anyone else.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_117.wav|89|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_135.wav|23|It was very, very difficult for me to look at this.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_106.wav|64|I know a lot of people who don't.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_065.wav|104|People remember the Tories in office.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_319.wav|6|That would be the constructive way forward.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_302.wav|22|Broke the birdie record.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_247.wav|3|Did he trip ?
DUMMY2/p264/p264_233.wav|65|It was a great evening.)
DUMMY2/p229/p229_389.wav|67|That's the name of the game, though.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_187.wav|15|It was a deeply moving musical experience.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_006.wav|36|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_105.wav|1|The conductor, too, will have adjustments to make.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_376.wav|28|There is no hiding place in it, no room for passengers.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_335.wav|52|Sports Secretary Chris Smith welcomed the action.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_349.wav|57|You must have a government and a good civil service.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_196.wav|97|Everyone needs a holiday, even the Salvation Army.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_417.wav|103|It is so elusive and light.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_024.wav|86|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_101.wav|70|Tomorrow he will make a keynote speech on Europe.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_303.wav|15|We have nothing to hide.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_254.wav|7|The body follows the mind.)
DUMMY2/p347/p347_115.wav|46|Henry was strong and talented.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_138.wav|46|I thought it was quite good.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_417.wav|22|Gaelic provision continued to be good.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_299.wav|94|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_063.wav|42|Nobody can get at them there.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_092.wav|52|Clark was delighted with the effort of Jones.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_395.wav|91|We have been working closely with Holyrood.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_128.wav|37|He put some colour into Scottish history.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_169.wav|15|I always wanted her to be happy.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_195.wav|83|It's a fact.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_387.wav|29|I am a member of the Labour Party staff.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_012.wav|21|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_220.wav|20|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_244.wav|25|We did not compete with any other local farmer.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_012.wav|84|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_058.wav|88|That's where it all started.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_256.wav|42|However, we had no failures in our side.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_368.wav|104|He found it very hard to understand.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_184.wav|89|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_179.wav|37|You can spend money on housing.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_343.wav|9|He can do no wrong.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_128.wav|47|We never said that we would walk through the third division.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_316.wav|87|It comes from reflection or thinking.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_149.wav|46|You do have a way out.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_067.wav|33|We can't go home.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_313.wav|41|We are in the end game.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_342.wav|14|It is inherent in society.)
DUMMY2/p236/p236_281.wav|75|They must play for each other.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_052.wav|96|We were surprised to see the photograph.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_153.wav|0|We are still getting over it.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_002.wav|62|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_277.wav|58|Is this new report the answer?
DUMMY2/p233/p233_377.wav|84|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_099.wav|7|He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels.)
DUMMY2/p227/p227_380.wav|29|We are still getting over it.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_242.wav|97|They were even being used by primary pupils.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_286.wav|77|He ran into immediate problems with local people and police.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_391.wav|53|My tax affairs have been totally open.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_253.wav|54|The composer therefore believes he can do it.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_350.wav|78|This isn't the end of story.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_375.wav|11|The mood was euphoric.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_022.wav|74|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_374.wav|52|It was another black day for Ayrshire.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_042.wav|49|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_033.wav|101|It's really no great surprise, because the price difference is so much.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_234.wav|26|We are in the hat.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_001.wav|77|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_035.wav|79|He was jailed for four years.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_181.wav|81|What has caused the demise of singing?
DUMMY2/p230/p230_106.wav|35|It is an impressive record.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_270.wav|45|It was an easy decision to come here.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_311.wav|86|I was rubbish.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_253.wav|81|We have to expand.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_308.wav|28|Could you put it in writing?
DUMMY2/p259/p259_120.wav|7|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.)
DUMMY2/p227/p227_269.wav|29|Is it in the right place ?
DUMMY2/p330/p330_277.wav|1|The film has also been superbly designed.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_255.wav|77|That you can do it.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_017.wav|86|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_016.wav|46|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_149.wav|45|I knew he was good.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_289.wav|27|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_072.wav|96|That was the easy election.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_008.wav|101|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_076.wav|54|I'm so proud of my team.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_356.wav|40|We will be homeless.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_282.wav|79|Indeed, that has already begun.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_192.wav|63|They are only interested in attacking Labour.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_074.wav|25|Have a look at our accounts.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_151.wav|18|We were extremely lucky.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_013.wav|87|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_164.wav|85|We did not deserve to go through.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_368.wav|9|We will be homeless.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_382.wav|68|We are being hijacked.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_197.wav|38|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_180.wav|83|Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_065.wav|54|I am a drug addict.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_366.wav|52|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_155.wav|44|Except, this time, it seems, he really, really means it.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_282.wav|94|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_081.wav|40|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_302.wav|104|Everything is so commercial.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_104.wav|53|They won't actually make any money from it.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_386.wav|87|We were beaten by the better team.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_220.wav|85|We need a much wider debate.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_050.wav|66|That says something for his strength of character.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_371.wav|64|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_129.wav|66|It ended as it began, in confusion.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_076.wav|66|But there was a shift.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_030.wav|16|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_102.wav|47|He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_021.wav|76|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the sizes of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_068.wav|44|Some people still think she should be English.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_052.wav|64|This is the same old story.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_130.wav|34|I see no need for change.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_379.wav|62|Stand by for action.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_202.wav|19|It looks as though there is no chance.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_139.wav|92|That, however, is the end of the good news.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_365.wav|105|YOU thought it was a headache.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_323.wav|69|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_129.wav|55|We beat the Welsh team.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_248.wav|4|Only four of his passengers were uninjured.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_069.wav|69|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_145.wav|23|The same goes for McKenna.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_038.wav|50|The man became a reporter.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_406.wav|72|The baby deserves the credit.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_175.wav|67|Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_336.wav|32|And he goes with it.)
DUMMY2/p335/p335_273.wav|49|The council has been open and transparent.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_403.wav|42|In addition, it was just a breach of natural justice.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_347.wav|3|The suggestion is the market is not instantly attracted.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_106.wav|2|She is believed to be in South Africa.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_278.wav|11|At the end of the day, two men have been shot.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_423.wav|37|It also makes a habit of collecting people.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_006.wav|12|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_421.wav|6|It could have taken another two months.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_205.wav|5|It had all been arranged.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_202.wav|76|It looks as though there is no chance.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_278.wav|37|The feedback from audiences was just so positive.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_239.wav|51|But if they were there, they were keeping a low profile.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_290.wav|11|He's very good at relating to adults.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_252.wav|95|It was a crazy day.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_086.wav|46|It's a true story.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_158.wav|3|The players were under pressure.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_406.wav|26|A new leader is unlikely to be chosen before September.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_368.wav|107|But it may not be all bad news.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_198.wav|11|His name is Michael Owen.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_381.wav|72|She failed to win any of them.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_121.wav|12|It is not a definite proposal as yet.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_002.wav|107|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_069.wav|80|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_329.wav|55|The performance continues to improve.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_033.wav|39|Allan Johnston was not match fit.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_094.wav|31|The selection process is still at a very early stage.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_300.wav|83|This is a war over our home.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_362.wav|102|Butcher has only one idea in mind.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_331.wav|78|What are they for ?
DUMMY2/p277/p277_455.wav|89|We're hopefully going to act as a catalyst for that.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_039.wav|49|He will emerge as a world leader.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_315.wav|11|It's never over until it's over.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_188.wav|12|The faith of large numbers remain unknown.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_238.wav|43|Hospitals are for the ill.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_222.wav|68|She has now been registered as disabled.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_369.wav|45|Talks are progressing.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_161.wav|99|Eight months later, he was dead.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_405.wav|36|It had been on the cards.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_382.wav|16|It is hard to understand.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_028.wav|37|There was a rush of water.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_070.wav|42|In the end, however, it all came together.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_302.wav|52|And does it ?
DUMMY2/p310/p310_304.wav|17|That would have been too easy.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_389.wav|53|He remains a main board director of Royal.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_054.wav|41|Is a drug dealer?
DUMMY2/p251/p251_010.wav|9|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_075.wav|39|Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_226.wav|45|At the time, he was a living legend.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_364.wav|40|It's now down in black and white.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_274.wav|48|They are determined to make a meaningful contribution.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_125.wav|44|I asked why he had come.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_115.wav|56|His job was not advertised.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_036.wav|39|Life was like a timetable.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_375.wav|62|It was a long time coming.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_083.wav|38|This must be really short of ideas.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_214.wav|11|I thought their commitment was superb.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_265.wav|14|Washington is consumed by the crisis.)
DUMMY2/p258/p258_202.wav|26|It was worth a photograph.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_089.wav|75|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
DUMMY2/p316/p316_046.wav|85|They were taken to prove a point.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_336.wav|13|I've never had problems with any football managers.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_120.wav|103|They don't have to, but they normally do.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_260.wav|10|We have no information on Iraq.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_385.wav|58|We suspect he was pleased.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_117.wav|43|I don't have many friends.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_399.wav|72|It seems a waste of talents.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_125.wav|42|Those who are unwilling or unable to improve.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_388.wav|14|It benefits the whole family.)
DUMMY2/p258/p258_101.wav|26|They had to be cut from the wreckage.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_103.wav|98|This is not finished.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_418.wav|65|The legislation is expected to be introduced next spring.)
DUMMY2/p299/p299_173.wav|58|We've been there for seven years.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_220.wav|18|However, he added there were signs of progress.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_087.wav|46|This is a club on the rise.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_102.wav|16|They make a selective perception process.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_084.wav|69|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_404.wav|42|I played really well on the back nine.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_056.wav|56|We have to keep our clients.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_012.wav|69|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_438.wav|7|This market has been neglected by the whisky industry.)
DUMMY2/p374/p374_271.wav|11|Three months or so later, they are returning.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_178.wav|10|I always felt they played for me.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_141.wav|86|The way he took his second goal was brilliant.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_133.wav|53|No country has a similar training programme.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_285.wav|41|I saw it at a ruck.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_140.wav|1|He will be judged by his actions.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_125.wav|61|But it took a lot of bottle.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_016.wav|63|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_327.wav|96|My view has now completely changed.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_085.wav|40|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_101.wav|56|I'm delighted for everyone at Stirling.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_318.wav|13|Is he going to look after them?
DUMMY2/p298/p298_177.wav|68|There was pressure from elsewhere too.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_252.wav|5|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_073.wav|46|They had not been handcuffed.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_229.wav|7|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.)
DUMMY2/p334/p334_033.wav|38|I don't know why you say goodbye.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_447.wav|24|External auditors will monitor the action which is planned.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_104.wav|34|The decision was designed to shock investors.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_344.wav|48|The FBI could become involved.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_259.wav|103|He was a crazy man.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_029.wav|78|It is about investing in the future.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_230.wav|15|He has every right to do that.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_167.wav|39|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_350.wav|16|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_053.wav|22|It also calls for licensing of collection centres.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_008.wav|20|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_211.wav|55|Their bodies were never found.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_084.wav|74|Willie deserved it, for what he has achieved.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_017.wav|34|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_134.wav|27|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_002.wav|6|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_106.wav|31|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_194.wav|98|Where do you think she is going?
DUMMY2/p243/p243_225.wav|53|The price was raised after massive demand from retail investors.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_069.wav|10|The party is up for it.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_162.wav|17|I hadn't been looking after myself.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_058.wav|57|That's the truth.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_360.wav|76|A handful of those restrictions are in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_356.wav|3|That is the lesson of the last three weeks.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_153.wav|11|But opinion was divided.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_121.wav|100|It is too pretty, it is too small.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_055.wav|2|We will treat it like a World Cup match.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_393.wav|36|Are they free ?
DUMMY2/p340/p340_003.wav|74|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_269.wav|25|It left me with a sadness.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_040.wav|77|There is no reason at all.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_339.wav|0|Did it work ?
DUMMY2/p339/p339_113.wav|18|Sometimes they come off.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_179.wav|24|You will be very welcome.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_100.wav|104|You should have let it write the cards.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_281.wav|95|It might be sad, but it's a fact.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_144.wav|54|It would have very little impact on them.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_380.wav|50|We will win the argument.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_404.wav|24|It has only been rumours.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_351.wav|89|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_390.wav|4|For us, that decision was hard to understand.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_163.wav|31|The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_278.wav|79|Here we go then.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_338.wav|41|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_409.wav|26|The visual arts committee took this decision in December.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_203.wav|43|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_012.wav|100|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_104.wav|78|The trick is to try it.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_448.wav|37|Our performance continues to be outstanding.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_014.wav|105|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_103.wav|5|Before the game we went for a pint.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_027.wav|31|They should be so lucky.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_107.wav|61|They had to be cut from the wreckage.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_197.wav|87|You've got to be vigilant.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_011.wav|96|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_346.wav|27|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_272.wav|1|I always knew she was funny.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_088.wav|67|They lived for their children.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_174.wav|33|But is that possible?
DUMMY2/p329/p329_228.wav|103|All businesses continue to trade.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_155.wav|78|It was all for good reason as well.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_242.wav|49|You cannot allow it to go on.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_357.wav|89|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_287.wav|24|Do I think about them often ?
DUMMY2/p227/p227_279.wav|29|On the contrary they stand to gain.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_302.wav|57|Is there on his hands ?
DUMMY2/p288/p288_370.wav|47|All the investment is possible through the public sector.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_273.wav|36|England could only play the other team on the park.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_163.wav|37|He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_268.wav|45|It's very nice.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_322.wav|54|I just could not cope.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_205.wav|71|"That is an important part of our role."
DUMMY2/p278/p278_355.wav|10|He was at school in Devon.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_292.wav|85|We deserved the three points.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_177.wav|54|This is a dream come true for me.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_405.wav|8|Ferguson must take the blame.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_288.wav|18|That prevented any recurrence of the problem.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_004.wav|25|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_397.wav|38|Being captain of this club is fantastic.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_076.wav|48|The Government does not go far enough.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_334.wav|38|The plot is simple.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_317.wav|54|The budget was too low for that.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_217.wav|48|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_275.wav|82|Anyone else can apply.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_294.wav|45|Well, he can do it.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_123.wav|51|It is a great shame.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_101.wav|49|I like what has happened!
DUMMY2/p299/p299_170.wav|58|She is a very lucky lady.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_391.wav|51|Partition is not an option.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_363.wav|75|We must put a marker down.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_306.wav|104|The order went out.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_086.wav|22|The general secretary, represents a new era in Labour party politics.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_118.wav|6|I wish him well.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_182.wav|15|England will be quite prepared.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_254.wav|74|Let's make this clear.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_168.wav|102|Four policemen were wounded.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_335.wav|70|They should take their mobile phones.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_239.wav|25|You take a risk.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_298.wav|61|Holland won by five wickets.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_171.wav|28|Tourism continues to struggle.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_065.wav|51|Except, this time, it seems, he really, really means it.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_112.wav|48|Talk of a crisis is absurd.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_261.wav|27|Chelsea was a great club.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_206.wav|10|We could soon be in that same position!
DUMMY2/p255/p255_183.wav|31|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_253.wav|41|That could be in place by next year.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_004.wav|96|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_007.wav|95|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_104.wav|105|That time is not now, however.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_320.wav|5|I came into this world with nothing.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_293.wav|75|Stephen will get his first cap.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_124.wav|1|Repayment is not part of the game.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_029.wav|95|Because we do not need it.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_089.wav|95|I've had it for the exams.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_315.wav|55|The process will start tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_031.wav|92|Which is where the manager comes in.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_255.wav|50|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_091.wav|55|Earlier, both main parties agreed a crucial stage had been reached.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_348.wav|81|A great deal has been achieved.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_056.wav|48|Bill Clinton always had an idea to sell.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_401.wav|68|The Olympic committee should be ashamed of themselves.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_368.wav|84|Colour was at the core of his life.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_143.wav|64|He had reason to be pleased.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_207.wav|94|I had been at the Evening Standard for two years.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_203.wav|31|However, he said the money had not been wasted.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_280.wav|68|And who were they anyway, beforehand?
DUMMY2/p228/p228_350.wav|57|As, indeed, they would be.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_395.wav|96|We're looking for justice.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_231.wav|2|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_302.wav|97|The failings are serious.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_015.wav|8|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_240.wav|94|It's quite nice.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_369.wav|0|There is no deal as yet.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_371.wav|41|They play together perfectly.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_103.wav|42|However, what is his calibre?
DUMMY2/p253/p253_111.wav|70|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_246.wav|76|We haven't come out of this very well.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_128.wav|54|Who is the employer?
DUMMY2/p254/p254_188.wav|41|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_052.wav|47|Sadly, it can't.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_075.wav|107|He now lives in Edinburgh with his wife, Caroline.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_024.wav|25|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_119.wav|54|A lot of things can go wrong.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_210.wav|16|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_243.wav|0|The irony was not lost.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_192.wav|49|That wasn't for me.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_190.wav|103|Who is going to be penalised?
DUMMY2/p326/p326_322.wav|28|A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_236.wav|88|Thankfully they liked it.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_311.wav|107|It plans to return to this field.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_010.wav|64|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_109.wav|35|Abbey National is an option.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_368.wav|10|We're still the only ones in the High Street.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_095.wav|1|Who said impatience is a virtue?
DUMMY2/p301/p301_243.wav|91|His son is a local legend.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_265.wav|15|Substantial pockets of resistance remain.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_184.wav|19|He quit in October.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_335.wav|87|It is a triumphant performance, which defies the years.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_021.wav|35|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_083.wav|72|I am happy to play for Aberdeen.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_268.wav|11|I was an athlete.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_200.wav|14|It's very difficult to find a buyer.)
DUMMY2/p270/p270_384.wav|8|Scrutiny by the European Parliament is limited.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_085.wav|39|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_096.wav|48|Kenny Miller might come through.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_378.wav|104|There could be a way back.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_291.wav|22|The painting was started, but finishing it was quite another matter.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_327.wav|18|There isn't much of a scene in Austria.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_040.wav|12|Some people begin to turn away, to go home.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_201.wav|23|What's the rush?
DUMMY2/p279/p279_250.wav|25|This year I understood.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_047.wav|19|We offered something different.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_118.wav|79|We couldn't get enough of it.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_245.wav|55|This is absolutely not true.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_212.wav|35|There is no quick fix.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_356.wav|11|It does seem a mystery.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_124.wav|32|Are you going to win ?)
DUMMY2/p345/p345_377.wav|82|The letters are going out today.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_315.wav|79|They are already there.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_345.wav|33|It will carry on.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_228.wav|66|IT was a thoroughly modern affair.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_155.wav|64|I've been asked that already, this morning - on the radio.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_038.wav|37|Alliance Leicester would give it a presence in southern England.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_003.wav|2|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_055.wav|61|Life is good.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_180.wav|79|I could have been offended.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_258.wav|106|I felt we deserved the three points.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_450.wav|75|We are going for it.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_296.wav|52|The strong performance is expected to continue.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_037.wav|66|This has been blown out of all proportion.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_149.wav|97|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_429.wav|95|I'm pleased about one thing.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_275.wav|0|We're trying to get rounded performers.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_059.wav|25|Life is good.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_105.wav|17|His treatment has been quite atrocious.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_350.wav|103|I just had so much fun.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_377.wav|8|This view was echoed by the other Scottish analyst.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_469.wav|75|When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_001.wav|68|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_279.wav|103|That's a very strong element.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_319.wav|45|I never thought it would take this long.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_004.wav|11|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_471.wav|95|It's been a long, long journey.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_213.wav|41|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_042.wav|25|I was scared.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_328.wav|79|It's all about unfinished business.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_407.wav|98|It would be that absurd.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_309.wav|25|It's certainly different.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_311.wav|46|I think that could work to our advantage.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_220.wav|0|Because they didn't want to know.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_016.wav|81|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_001.wav|54|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_106.wav|90|Get to know him.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_008.wav|32|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. )
DUMMY2/p249/p249_021.wav|80|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_117.wav|49|Police were also perplexed.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_209.wav|8|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_220.wav|54|It may be his last for a while, too.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_241.wav|1|We have to concentrate on three points tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_006.wav|51|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_260.wav|79|Was he confident about his prospects?
DUMMY2/p292/p292_168.wav|13|It's been a good year.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_061.wav|92|I just have no maternal instincts.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_178.wav|61|Waiting times for these services are too long.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_141.wav|20|Who would be right?
DUMMY2/p239/p239_130.wav|48|Are they free ?
DUMMY2/p253/p253_021.wav|70|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_058.wav|39|I've got to provide for my family.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_170.wav|74|As far as we're concerned, the matter is closed.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_382.wav|35|I always knew she was funny.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_064.wav|40|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_127.wav|107|They prefer the short, intensive session.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_251.wav|83|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_098.wav|11|They might also be reviewed by their colleagues.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_276.wav|81|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_127.wav|62|What's wrong with that?
DUMMY2/p255/p255_128.wav|31|The role was perfect for Russell.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_405.wav|40|He scored a touchdown.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_233.wav|67|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_178.wav|75|So what happens next ?
DUMMY2/p339/p339_149.wav|18|It was so sad.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_218.wav|5|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_243.wav|86|The scene is about this?
DUMMY2/p303/p303_077.wav|44|He was obviously very genuine.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_322.wav|72|I think it is wide open.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_211.wav|71|"A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar."
DUMMY2/p234/p234_117.wav|3|And we had a good response.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_169.wav|11|That's the kind of production it was.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_267.wav|21|If he could have prevented it happening, he would have.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_420.wav|100|Smoking is also very important.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_268.wav|59|Of course I was tempted.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_052.wav|11|I find it puzzling and disturbing.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_356.wav|32|It's wonderful to have won.)
DUMMY2/p233/p233_086.wav|84|How are you, sir ?
DUMMY2/p363/p363_093.wav|6|I'd never be satisfied with just the relay.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_229.wav|16|There is no excuse.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_243.wav|20|My son was too young to die.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_398.wav|78|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_301.wav|104|Their bid was a very good one.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_182.wav|65|He is particularly happy with the size of the gallery.)
DUMMY2/p255/p255_040.wav|31|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_450.wav|8|Our legal advice is clear.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_308.wav|39|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
DUMMY2/p312/p312_342.wav|62|That was the biggest game of my life.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_326.wav|101|He will go a long way.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_376.wav|82|It has not yet opened to pupils.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_332.wav|54|I think he has undergone a sea change.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_135.wav|29|We could easily have lost that game.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_440.wav|75|But by that time, it was too late.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_239.wav|8|The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_218.wav|38|We are determined to establish the facts.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_443.wav|106|He now lives in Fenwick in Ayrshire.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_162.wav|106|A good actor doesn't think.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_061.wav|77|What do we do ?
DUMMY2/p339/p339_009.wav|18|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_110.wav|71|"It is rubbish."
DUMMY2/p269/p269_030.wav|94|I have a theory.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_342.wav|12|What kind of person is he?
DUMMY2/p283/p283_302.wav|95|At first I thought I was gone.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_146.wav|99|This film will be totally awesome.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_147.wav|31|I was awful.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_188.wav|102|The fate of large numbers remains unknown.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_047.wav|76|We offered something different.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_012.wav|85|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_370.wav|77|The members have voted against it.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_040.wav|75|The staff are as good as any staff in the city.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_232.wav|2|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_038.wav|3|Victory was never in doubt.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_164.wav|56|They are determined to make a meaningful contribution.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_165.wav|72|I really couldn't believe it had actually happened.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_419.wav|0|It needs to be volatile.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_121.wav|57|The picture is the same across Scotland.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_427.wav|95|One day, he threw the baby against a wall.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_026.wav|1|I was backing him up.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_352.wav|76|Two others were also seriously injured.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_185.wav|73|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_115.wav|67|I came to complete.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_282.wav|82|We are not going to be complacent.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_085.wav|32|It wasn't possible to relax.)
DUMMY2/p240/p240_302.wav|93|We have to sort it out ourselves.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_040.wav|56|People want to see me on the screen.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_094.wav|91|His female companion was being treated for shock.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_312.wav|69|It will work.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_150.wav|41|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_208.wav|104|This club is perfect for me.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_337.wav|7|What do they want us to do ?)
DUMMY2/p231/p231_206.wav|50|It gave no further details.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_038.wav|48|How do you take them away ?
DUMMY2/p253/p253_337.wav|70|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_262.wav|38|That, he claimed, was essential.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_432.wav|89|It's been a long, long journey.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_307.wav|92|It is good for Europe.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_419.wav|19|I didn't play all that well.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_122.wav|76|It's a way of making a mark.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_086.wav|52|Clearly he knows nothing about Glasgow or Glasgow Green.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_459.wav|89|She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_358.wav|26|The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_091.wav|44|There were unconfirmed reports that it was cannabis.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_210.wav|3|It was the story of the second half.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_173.wav|89|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_309.wav|42|They will give it a couple of years.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_104.wav|9|Further protests are likely.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_355.wav|29|The US Open was very difficult, but it was enjoyable.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_033.wav|49|But she was very human.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_296.wav|35|It took a month and a half to film.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_038.wav|99|But it may take some time to confirm the findings.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_001.wav|95|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_141.wav|97|Who honestly expected anything else?
DUMMY2/p243/p243_234.wav|53|The labour side has developed in the North area.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_153.wav|52|Do you think we are a top nation ?
DUMMY2/p345/p345_301.wav|82|It will be extremely difficult for him.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_113.wav|50|It proved a good decision.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_349.wav|27|I believe the gap is nearly there.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_229.wav|107|It is something that we will put right.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_386.wav|91|We were short of athletes.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_029.wav|0|Because we do not need it.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_103.wav|84|Police said the family was helping with the search.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_218.wav|52|A European final must be the millennium target.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_325.wav|46|I haven't won the world title.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_353.wav|72|My life is in the ballet.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_134.wav|105|I am now unemployed.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_315.wav|57|It's not long enough.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_193.wav|97|During the communist time they were very privileged.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_268.wav|39|My son was too young to die.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_257.wav|90|Chelsea was a great club.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_166.wav|52|It is no good thinking about Rangers at this time.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_214.wav|16|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_226.wav|28|He is a law unto himself.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_224.wav|32|We have not given up hope.)
DUMMY2/p265/p265_144.wav|73|We are looking for a good performance and a good result.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_194.wav|47|The conference is the first test.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_044.wav|69|I did not see any reason to change the captain.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_134.wav|12|There is still much work to be done.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_125.wav|23|Next league matches, Motherwell Dunfermline.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_219.wav|85|We've made a couple of albums.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_124.wav|83|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_325.wav|17|There is no threat to them.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_331.wav|97|It is still with Ministers.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_146.wav|84|It seems so long since I did the exams.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_247.wav|21|It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_110.wav|104|This has gone on too long.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_259.wav|71|"It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions."
DUMMY2/p323/p323_003.wav|34|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_321.wav|62|I wouldn't say this is normal.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_292.wav|22|He is married, with one daughter, and lives in Kent.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_119.wav|30|It ignores the future.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_261.wav|21|It would have been very easily done.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_020.wav|46|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_161.wav|89|He can do no wrong.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_063.wav|32|We need to increase the membership.)
DUMMY2/p252/p252_135.wav|55|Look, George W Bush will come here in two months.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_070.wav|25|They're appalled by that.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_367.wav|40|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_141.wav|27|It seems so long since I did the exams.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_145.wav|53|All eight victims were based in Germany.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_013.wav|9|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_172.wav|74|It is no more than a shell.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_389.wav|55|The women are victims here.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_172.wav|21|I shall be voting Yes to support him.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_160.wav|81|It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_036.wav|97|It was a policy they were against.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_061.wav|8|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_382.wav|64|Partly, but only partly, this is their own fault.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_446.wav|37|Hard cash is needed now.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_138.wav|22|The son has autism and other problems.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_118.wav|10|This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_018.wav|84|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_015.wav|69|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_106.wav|22|I think my game is suited to grass.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_019.wav|5|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_004.wav|42|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_327.wav|83|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_158.wav|17|This can only help us go forward.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_207.wav|11|Glasgow is a friendly city.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_071.wav|73|What has changed?
DUMMY2/p258/p258_020.wav|26|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_088.wav|20|It will be tight.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_277.wav|56|It was never a free kick.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_181.wav|70|It's an idea.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_409.wav|35|It had been on the cards.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_047.wav|36|He looks like an Afghan.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_357.wav|69|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_192.wav|47|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_399.wav|46|They were both very brave.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_275.wav|73|You've got to have both sides.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_044.wav|41|However, the decision has been welcomed by Scottish Enterprise officials.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_053.wav|27|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_398.wav|7|The principle is quite clear.)
DUMMY2/p268/p268_343.wav|87|My daughter is an adult.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_065.wav|4|Only one got through.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_072.wav|102|In the past few years, they have started to fight back.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_284.wav|82|His body was found in May.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_246.wav|52|I think, therefore I am ?
DUMMY2/p283/p283_137.wav|95|This should begin in October.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_048.wav|33|That is not the case.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_273.wav|48|I thought we were fantastic.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_355.wav|22|That only came out during a radio interview.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_372.wav|22|His job was not advertised.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_299.wav|68|And he had much need.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_319.wav|55|One finding emerged clearly.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_230.wav|39|It is safe in our hands.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_325.wav|39|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_036.wav|45|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_048.wav|81|Our people are ready.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_205.wav|26|We have an election in eight days.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_090.wav|30|The same goes for personnel.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_218.wav|27|I might come back.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_381.wav|75|I can confirm that Miss Deacon has received a threatening phone call.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_306.wav|86|SCOTLAND has shown the way.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_184.wav|4|This may be perfectly innocent.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_058.wav|63|We have not given up hope.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_070.wav|106|The Labour Party's not downbeat, and neither is the Labour Government.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_061.wav|30|Martin Johnson, the England captain, was back, and commanding.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_221.wav|68|We have our supporters and our enemies.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_126.wav|46|We are in the business of selling tickets.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_250.wav|22|I hope it has helped the prisoners.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_191.wav|20|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_263.wav|97|If only the problems concerned the players.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_080.wav|4|We've got a job to do.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_337.wav|87|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_063.wav|90|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_059.wav|39|It was bound to happen.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_167.wav|23|It's unfair on her.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_020.wav|92|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_076.wav|55|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
DUMMY2/p247/p247_063.wav|14|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?)
DUMMY2/p361/p361_157.wav|79|Something has to be put in place.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_225.wav|27|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_049.wav|24|It comes from reflection or thinking.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_044.wav|87|However, the purchase is as yet unproven.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_153.wav|4|I certainly think it's very short-sighted.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_156.wav|29|I'd love to be like Peter.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_027.wav|90|I have a theory.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_418.wav|103|Or was it Some kind of a ham?
DUMMY2/p285/p285_168.wav|2|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_154.wav|13|He also has property interests in the country.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_417.wav|51|They will run in tandem with New Work.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_419.wav|85|Audiences there were shocked.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_347.wav|20|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_172.wav|50|My life has been destroyed.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_028.wav|29|We will look into it.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_334.wav|3|We have to be very, very careful.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_296.wav|21|It makes no influence on the public.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_247.wav|78|Do I think about them often ?
DUMMY2/p272/p272_128.wav|69|I'm so angry.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_078.wav|20|I will miss him.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_296.wav|48|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_330.wav|35|This is a historic occasion.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_366.wav|37|We played them off the pitch.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_105.wav|11|It's a very, very special day.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_363.wav|53|Such a policy is for long-term strength.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_316.wav|53|A report on their property is due within days.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_087.wav|51|It opens the door to the Champions League.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_267.wav|61|Scotland has competed in its own right in cycling.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_328.wav|19|It went on to become an annual event.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_034.wav|70|It is marvellous.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_184.wav|15|There is no conflict of interest.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_194.wav|93|It is a farce.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_006.wav|47|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_107.wav|50|And does it ?
DUMMY2/p256/p256_198.wav|90|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_182.wav|88|We will see how he is.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_191.wav|87|That is an entirely unacceptable position.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_101.wav|4|Johnsen is equally concerned.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_314.wav|81|The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_112.wav|95|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_012.wav|4|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_357.wav|2|It is a memorial.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_050.wav|42|At the time, he was a living legend.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_237.wav|53|He has worked for several years in the United States.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_338.wav|80|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_349.wav|84|Tyson is overwhelmed.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_324.wav|89|It sounded as if it might well be tragic.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_137.wav|61|It's perfectly feasible.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_170.wav|16|As we worked.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_366.wav|47|It was a double tragedy for the family.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_066.wav|23|It can happen to you, it can happen to anyone.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_293.wav|73|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_075.wav|68|She goes to the opening of an envelope.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_265.wav|80|He has not created a Festival resource.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_217.wav|88|It's happened, but it's a dream.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_370.wav|83|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_117.wav|23|She doesn't know me, know anything about me.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_359.wav|14|He said something in his work.)
DUMMY2/p261/p261_075.wav|100|These people are not big names.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_475.wav|24|At the moment, social workers take the lead on child protection issues.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_044.wav|95|But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_401.wav|87|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_309.wav|45|We are now looking at the degrees of injury.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_075.wav|11|I'd love to do another Olympics.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_361.wav|32|It has to solve the nuclear waste disposal problem.)
DUMMY2/p274/p274_255.wav|32|How independent is that ?)
DUMMY2/p317/p317_133.wav|97|They too refused to come out and talk.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_067.wav|31|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_258.wav|52|Despite his success, things began to fall apart.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_138.wav|65|It's very dangerous for markets.)
DUMMY2/p245/p245_154.wav|59|We wanted it left for a wee while.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_367.wav|13|Like his acting, it was an accident.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_241.wav|34|Nobody wants to stop people enjoying themselves.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_411.wav|55|I'd like to report a murder.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_227.wav|97|It's unsafe for society.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_340.wav|77|You may have a short memory.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_038.wav|39|You have to expect this type of thing.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_294.wav|10|Both companies have had a rough ride in recent years.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_173.wav|65|Art can challenge our value system.)
DUMMY2/p318/p318_064.wav|19|I learned a lot from that.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_086.wav|77|We would hope to make progress on that next year.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_074.wav|24|We need to increase the membership.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_125.wav|10|Which can happen any time.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_036.wav|71|"Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist."
DUMMY2/p287/p287_372.wav|77|But the Foreign Secretary can cope.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_376.wav|36|The pair are very much in love.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_230.wav|100|A terrorist is a terrorist.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_296.wav|14|It's hard to see it.)
DUMMY2/p323/p323_175.wav|34|We have done a deal with IMPACT.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_167.wav|43|They will do their own thing.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_401.wav|47|You ask the question.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_037.wav|33|Both sides will be aware of this.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_288.wav|2|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_329.wav|103|I can't believe something like this could happen.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_376.wav|63|Yesterday was a statement of intent.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_133.wav|8|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
DUMMY2/p231/p231_291.wav|50|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_157.wav|67|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_376.wav|87|My wife and family are the support system.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_024.wav|29|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_389.wav|87|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_092.wav|61|However, it did not end that way.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_076.wav|87|But the organisers refused to worry.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_133.wav|19|I am sorry to hear this news.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_063.wav|19|I was chosen to do this.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_416.wav|78|There is no need to panic.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_258.wav|36|Kingfisher can afford to wait.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_330.wav|65|I can't get away from it.)
DUMMY2/p300/p300_185.wav|102|I am writing a novel.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_136.wav|69|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_152.wav|78|It starts at the top.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_239.wav|29|There is a world of difference.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_152.wav|51|But perhaps we shouldn't worry too much.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_187.wav|42|I'll tell you honestly.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_239.wav|23|She returned home a few days later.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_021.wav|10|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_208.wav|16|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_189.wav|45|We must keep our feet on the ground.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_085.wav|103|There are no excuses.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_278.wav|10|I rejected the idea of a separate residence.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_219.wav|39|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_403.wav|63|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_151.wav|29|I was shaking on the blocks.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_199.wav|42|Any error is severely punished.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_403.wav|39|We felt at the moment, it was not possible.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_119.wav|96|This is the end of a chapter, and this is very sad.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_271.wav|69|If not, he should go home.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_314.wav|89|It's too horrible to think.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_349.wav|92|No one wants to go through these things.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_383.wav|74|I hadn't had that before.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_185.wav|46|I was chosen to do this.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_360.wav|36|Alex Ferguson is the same.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_406.wav|11|We need to chat.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_143.wav|60|Now we look forward to it.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_061.wav|84|You have to be patient.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_181.wav|61|Mr Blunkett said he was deeply concerned by the ruling.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_403.wav|92|We wanted to run away with her.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_180.wav|99|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_288.wav|65|If not, a deal could take many months.)
DUMMY2/p360/p360_179.wav|60|That's when you hope to take advantage.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_180.wav|3|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_070.wav|19|I am confident of the outcome this week.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_063.wav|16|They are real.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_025.wav|66|This guy is never going to give up.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_239.wav|84|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_295.wav|14|We have an excellent record of passenger growth and customer service.)
DUMMY2/p313/p313_212.wav|76|But there's no eye contact.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_422.wav|100|We're delighted about the vote.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_009.wav|12|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_225.wav|72|I see no reason for them to be.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_238.wav|107|His silence on the issue is interesting.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_364.wav|11|I disagree entirely with the decision.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_051.wav|80|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_373.wav|7|Many of these properties are located in the south of England.)
DUMMY2/p330/p330_199.wav|1|Today, however, half of them get this financial help.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_211.wav|0|I'm just a regular person.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_201.wav|0|A bit of match fitness is required.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_003.wav|51|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_199.wav|50|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_243.wav|33|This is excellent news for the workforce.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_367.wav|32|He had no previous convictions.)
DUMMY2/p301/p301_360.wav|91|I am not among its admirers.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_337.wav|106|It comes from reflection or thinking.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_039.wav|39|No company would want to put their people at risk.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_310.wav|55|Good players have become bad.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_075.wav|8|My immune system had been depleted.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_289.wav|74|It wasn't an easy decision.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_409.wav|27|The weekly average was three hours.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_039.wav|48|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
DUMMY2/p311/p311_287.wav|4|The defender made an impressive debut.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_334.wav|77|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
DUMMY2/p255/p255_100.wav|31|That time is not now, however.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_034.wav|55|I have every confidence.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_403.wav|104|We will deal with the refugees.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_301.wav|17|It was nice to get a clean sheet.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_051.wav|101|We are committed to the ban.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_125.wav|9|Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_074.wav|98|Yet what is supposed to be said?
DUMMY2/p363/p363_237.wav|6|By then it was too late.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_247.wav|81|Is there on his hands?
DUMMY2/p292/p292_187.wav|13|It's not before time.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_347.wav|56|We have very limited capacity.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_002.wav|26|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_415.wav|4|They were outside the circle.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_082.wav|70|I will miss him.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_326.wav|64|It's fantastic to have finally won.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_130.wav|11|THE arrow was aimed at the heart.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_253.wav|43|I was never going to play against Scotland.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_010.wav|49|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_217.wav|10|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_124.wav|65|The family moved around a lot.)
DUMMY2/p311/p311_133.wav|4|The way ahead is not easy.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_411.wav|32|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.)
DUMMY2/p258/p258_338.wav|26|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_379.wav|22|It's being very carefully looked at.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_109.wav|18|It was all over now.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_051.wav|8|What do they want us to do ?
DUMMY2/p314/p314_133.wav|51|The final stage is paranoia.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_031.wav|24|We will not tolerate it.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_223.wav|70|It's not before time.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_157.wav|74|So we started building a home.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_230.wav|22|Sullivan was later charged with her murder, which she denied.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_008.wav|30|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_162.wav|29|Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_072.wav|93|I was just trying to win the golf tournament.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_410.wav|79|It has a rally instead of a conference.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_257.wav|102|Two things will count for us in Brussels.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_339.wav|19|I can't believe the buzz.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_379.wav|28|What are you supposed to do, just walk away?
DUMMY2/p269/p269_283.wav|94|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_061.wav|40|And if he hadn't become a musician?
DUMMY2/p254/p254_148.wav|41|There is a lack of chemistry.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_032.wav|25|People love to see this stuff.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_125.wav|25|I felt very strongly that England should have it.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_277.wav|27|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_159.wav|54|He had worked there for only two days.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_321.wav|11|It's not one for the purists.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_070.wav|104|I don't have any answer for them.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_300.wav|43|I thought it was my only chance.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_055.wav|90|He had no enemies.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_086.wav|1|Four minutes later, the show was over.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_170.wav|88|It's all happening at a local level.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_187.wav|56|It was a moment of madness.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_217.wav|15|They are not the answer to staff shortages.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_260.wav|67|That's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_261.wav|30|He also received a medal of honour.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_181.wav|106|I can see it now.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_390.wav|51|It was early morning.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_124.wav|107|There is only one caveat.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_067.wav|96|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_241.wav|40|Our policy is clear.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_045.wav|41|No meaningful response was issued.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_059.wav|87|Perhaps we should do the same.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_005.wav|2|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_093.wav|26|Journalists should make him.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_314.wav|31|In fact, they have the opposite effect.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_113.wav|39|It should be a great game, though.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_223.wav|0|What do we want to do that for ?
DUMMY2/p251/p251_051.wav|9|He had no enemies.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_276.wav|45|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_033.wav|51|They tend to be easily influenced by others.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_199.wav|86|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_001.wav|82|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_123.wav|3|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_251.wav|7|The scientific debate is dead.)
DUMMY2/p274/p274_289.wav|32|It opens the door to the Champions League.)
DUMMY2/p283/p283_209.wav|95|She was married with one son.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_260.wav|48|I'd been out with my girlfriend and we were attacked.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_038.wav|27|Indeed, he does.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_220.wav|33|He had worked there for only two days.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_167.wav|57|But we have not heard a thing from Diego.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_350.wav|92|You'll get on like a house on fire.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_383.wav|14|It's as wide as a church in here.)
DUMMY2/p228/p228_198.wav|57|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_122.wav|77|He is a great addition to our team.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_365.wav|95|The US Open was very difficult, but it was enjoyable.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_246.wav|46|There is only one caveat.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_283.wav|42|This is wrong, but that's believed.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_127.wav|66|I'm so proud of my team.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_263.wav|106|Then we will face the Danish champions.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_246.wav|12|Around the building, the atmosphere is brittle and hung over.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_017.wav|32|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. )
DUMMY2/p376/p376_244.wav|71|"He said he intended to push for a judicial review."
DUMMY2/p266/p266_110.wav|20|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_273.wav|80|Things can change.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_034.wav|31|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_127.wav|98|It's better than that, it's fantastic.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_259.wav|93|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_311.wav|20|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_210.wav|105|A Grampian Police spokesman said.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_194.wav|100|Both banks are heavily involved in the Scottish market.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_324.wav|11|We did discuss the Lockerbie issue.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_151.wav|52|Does that put pressure on us ?
DUMMY2/p310/p310_401.wav|17|It is a catalogue of obstruction.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_146.wav|11|It was indeed a night to remember.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_084.wav|95|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_333.wav|23|SOMETIMES, it's not what you say that counts.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_271.wav|107|Inclusion and Autism, Is It Working?
DUMMY2/p339/p339_235.wav|18|The answer is obviously no.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_098.wav|85|I will just have to be patient.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_051.wav|50|We keep an eye on it.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_262.wav|40|This is a question of Islam.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_290.wav|75|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_133.wav|23|Reviving the Scottish Open is one option.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_044.wav|32|People want to see me on the screen.)
DUMMY2/p264/p264_231.wav|65|This is absolutely not true.)
DUMMY2/p307/p307_283.wav|22|Wednesday's decision came as a surprise.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_250.wav|55|Our focus remains on quality revenue.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_003.wav|95|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_200.wav|82|Clearly we are looking at this very carefully.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_146.wav|56|Are you from the rugby ?
DUMMY2/p311/p311_170.wav|4|Willie deserved it, for what he has achieved.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_142.wav|63|He said to give a local injection.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_202.wav|14|Mr Blair was ready for him.)
DUMMY2/p329/p329_180.wav|103|I love the moment of being first.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_341.wav|39|He is married with three children.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_423.wav|65|This man must be helped to keep his arm.)
DUMMY2/p335/p335_041.wav|49|I only half believed it.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_198.wav|37|You are a gambling man.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_391.wav|6|Are these immoral?
DUMMY2/p318/p318_096.wav|19|That's the National Grid.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_130.wav|79|It will be released in October.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_208.wav|22|We have no choice but to shut down.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_187.wav|30|Luckily, our patient was stable.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_291.wav|30|He is a success story by any standard.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_080.wav|3|On the night, it was not enough.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_146.wav|6|There's a lot of it going on.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_209.wav|17|I feel sorry for the Reds.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_019.wav|90|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_376.wav|64|You will not feel a thing.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_354.wav|69|Not so, it seems.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_425.wav|7|It is hard to understand.)
DUMMY2/p232/p232_078.wav|96|It is a job creation scheme.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_392.wav|64|It is not a wish list.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_315.wav|14|His job was not advertised.)
DUMMY2/p308/p308_267.wav|107|It's a matter of huge concern.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_089.wav|13|But he just carried on anyway.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_101.wav|100|Before the game we went for a pint.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_135.wav|79|It will have to ratify the deal.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_284.wav|37|This championship is different from the other majors.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_128.wav|79|We've always had something to do.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_202.wav|50|how do you get it back ?
DUMMY2/p293/p293_393.wav|23|What happens when the funding is exhausted.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_191.wav|0|Final proposals will be published in February.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_126.wav|72|We are going to have a parade.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_313.wav|63|The rescue package is public money.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_177.wav|81|I've been there.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_292.wav|58|It's the curse of our time, irony.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_049.wav|40|He looks like an Afghan.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_299.wav|18|There has been a fair bit in between, too.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_399.wav|63|In fact, he was great today.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_126.wav|29|We are amazed that the current trading figures were so weak.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_097.wav|35|Two of the team became ill.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_189.wav|50|You know the sort of thing.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_106.wav|78|Victory was never in doubt.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_122.wav|95|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_319.wav|38|It's ahead of Labour.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_293.wav|38|He was telling me to keep quiet.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_145.wav|20|I was awful.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_227.wav|79|Mind you, it wouldn't be a bad idea.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_200.wav|67|I've got good news and bad news for you.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_116.wav|69|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_064.wav|14|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.)
DUMMY2/p255/p255_111.wav|31|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_368.wav|97|And he goes with it.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_289.wav|56|It's all designed to speed up the service.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_075.wav|73|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_218.wav|31|I had decided to quit the show.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_229.wav|80|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_284.wav|33|The rest, of course, is history.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_194.wav|30|Or so we have long assumed.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_316.wav|8|It is a road of death.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_327.wav|6|He was the architect.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_095.wav|20|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_241.wav|90|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_147.wav|89|He realises his mistake.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_308.wav|97|This is a dream come true for me.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_460.wav|63|The Edinburgh audience was able to understand the dialogue.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_288.wav|102|It puts the thought out, for other people to think about.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_034.wav|39|The idea is not new.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_342.wav|85|Only New Zealand has seen a similar increase.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_398.wav|105|I was very young.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_334.wav|64|He came in an army uniform.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_453.wav|39|It looked like a war zone.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_396.wav|38|The sun is worth a million dollars.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_389.wav|51|At this level, you have all to perform well.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_080.wav|83|Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_002.wav|96|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_077.wav|89|Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_034.wav|21|What can you do?
DUMMY2/p266/p266_019.wav|20|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_367.wav|26|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_149.wav|50|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_083.wav|37|The two clubs have agreed the transfer fee.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_185.wav|13|He had come of age.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_165.wav|64|His funeral is not expected until next week.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_196.wav|53|was everything done to save people ?
DUMMY2/p307/p307_296.wav|22|He or she will oversee the leadership contest.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_123.wav|84|Who would be a referee?
DUMMY2/p233/p233_072.wav|84|Seriously, we are not concerned at all.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_022.wav|76|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of a super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_297.wav|98|Last night, the extent of the damage was emerging.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_126.wav|97|A decision is expected shortly.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_052.wav|97|Are we going to stay up?
DUMMY2/p293/p293_120.wav|23|He also wants to play in this game, and that's important.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_275.wav|100|I was ready for this.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_421.wav|79|My life is going to go on.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_212.wav|68|Suspension will come into force at midnight.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_030.wav|87|We must convince the citizens.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_225.wav|28|Smith confirmed that their confidence was returning.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_330.wav|103|Quite simply, for once in his life, he got it wrong.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_319.wav|10|The answer was in space.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_333.wav|54|One must hope not!
DUMMY2/p277/p277_440.wav|89|And it showed.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_240.wav|86|Chambers said he would accept the place.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_117.wav|66|Both managements are very supportive.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_288.wav|50|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_304.wav|3|We're looking for unity in the council.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_225.wav|99|I have spoken to the skipper.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_277.wav|25|She looked so young.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_387.wav|8|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_159.wav|97|She is a double victim.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_055.wav|18|Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_194.wav|61|It is tough, but possible.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_265.wav|61|There will be widespread support on all sides.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_254.wav|27|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_306.wav|41|We are a peaceful people.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_030.wav|34|This is the best way to do it.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_357.wav|56|Do you think we are a top nation ?
DUMMY2/p254/p254_354.wav|41|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_130.wav|86|The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_226.wav|55|I'd rather play well next week than here.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_387.wav|19|Sure, we have problems.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_043.wav|13|Mr Blair should be warned.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_271.wav|62|I'm not afraid of that.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_363.wav|21|Sure, that already happens in New Zealand.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_253.wav|73|Treatment is aimed at the symptoms.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_048.wav|104|I'm really looking forward to seeing the fight.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_153.wav|97|They should be looking at his victims.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_161.wav|82|I have a great respect for her.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_225.wav|54|Borrowing power was one of those improvements.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_166.wav|8|Scotland came very close in the second Test.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_412.wav|103|Both reports appeared in the British Medical Journal.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_151.wav|8|It is not disputed that the driver was at fault.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_245.wav|62|Why has it taken so long?
DUMMY2/p288/p288_144.wav|47|That first victory made a huge difference to my career.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_344.wav|67|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_347.wav|5|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_146.wav|48|He was forced to quit.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_011.wav|47|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_241.wav|83|The scene is about this?
DUMMY2/p302/p302_101.wav|30|Because of this, he feels the hearing had been unfair.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_079.wav|87|He also had a Scottish grandfather.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_331.wav|40|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_253.wav|3|It was just another play.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_115.wav|9|Maybe this battle has been.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_234.wav|0|And he goes with it.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_162.wav|97|There can be no compromise on that demand.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_269.wav|106|Of course, it is a tough assignment.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_344.wav|2|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_313.wav|47|This is the culture change in medicine.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_121.wav|2|It has removed a bit of guilt.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_139.wav|45|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_144.wav|105|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_214.wav|29|I think, therefore I am ?
DUMMY2/p345/p345_111.wav|82|They were back in favour with the SAC.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_362.wav|11|It is almost like a family.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_403.wav|38|It was nerve-racking to watch.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_096.wav|35|It was some time before she found out he was safe.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_384.wav|70|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_424.wav|15|He refused to name the survivors.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_315.wav|27|The Premier League has been a huge success.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_124.wav|11|It is too early to speculate.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_327.wav|4|Eriksson, though, was having none of it.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_237.wav|30|I had a sense of deja vu.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_071.wav|102|For me, the tour is wide open this year.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_332.wav|81|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_166.wav|68|Hillary plans to meet him on the summit.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_154.wav|64|She is a valuable member of the Government.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_112.wav|102|There is great relief at this point.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_416.wav|19|But it's not the end of Scottish football.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_040.wav|105|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_042.wav|32|Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.)
DUMMY2/p285/p285_187.wav|2|What has caused the demise of singing?
DUMMY2/p251/p251_093.wav|9|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_249.wav|43|I should think so, too.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_230.wav|21|You have a very persuasive president.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_205.wav|25|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_113.wav|86|It's not fair.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_113.wav|66|This is thought to mean sometime next week.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_236.wav|41|The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_106.wav|16|Before the game we went for a pint.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_260.wav|105|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_067.wav|64|I've taken to the hills.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_015.wav|40|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_348.wav|1|It was a poor performance.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_360.wav|33|It may be his last for a while, too.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_115.wav|27|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_034.wav|78|These awards will deliver improvements on the ground.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_012.wav|7|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. )
DUMMY2/p255/p255_261.wav|31|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_165.wav|97|There was an e-mail.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_133.wav|38|It was a simple question.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_314.wav|14|Britain is going to celebrate in style.)
DUMMY2/p236/p236_010.wav|75|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_191.wav|2|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_144.wav|97|They never looked like winning it either.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_313.wav|44|Rapid revision was required.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_326.wav|102|She is now on the back benches.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_309.wav|64|Was that not awful?
DUMMY2/p246/p246_276.wav|5|He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_274.wav|49|We can do nothing about that.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_030.wav|32|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.)
DUMMY2/p230/p230_362.wav|35|I am a lucky man.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_305.wav|38|He is a Satan.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_321.wav|8|Was it the wife ?
DUMMY2/p295/p295_116.wav|92|I have no plans to retire.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_354.wav|15|We are delighted with the result.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_023.wav|8|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_309.wav|8|Sunday's game was not a trial.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_279.wav|94|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_366.wav|55|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_044.wav|49|The failings are serious.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_382.wav|19|As it was a double, it was pretty expensive.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_403.wav|62|No-one has yet been charged.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_263.wav|55|He makes time for everyone.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_213.wav|23|He will not be carrying out any surgery.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_131.wav|98|I have thought a lot about the Commonwealths.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_342.wav|72|It's all about money, money, money.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_257.wav|51|That will not change.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_082.wav|21|Colonel, About this committee that is coming.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_396.wav|34|That, however, was only the tip of the iceberg.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_336.wav|83|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_310.wav|6|The figures are bad, but not that bad.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_310.wav|94|But it's a subtle process.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_435.wav|75|But we have built a platform for next season.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_356.wav|72|He has something in common with the Wallabies.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_227.wav|47|The track is currently covered in snow.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_120.wav|97|It's to do with context.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_112.wav|40|It is so sad.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_028.wav|106|Do I have a favourite ?
DUMMY2/p305/p305_251.wav|54|She did not attend the courtroom.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_316.wav|62|They had three children.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_163.wav|49|But the price has been very high.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_172.wav|80|Tell it like it was?
DUMMY2/p232/p232_076.wav|96|I had my suspicions.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_002.wav|55|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_384.wav|82|They are appealing for witnesses.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_195.wav|70|It's a fact.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_048.wav|8|Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_212.wav|15|They continue to do so.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_292.wav|6|It was an achievement all right.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_072.wav|95|You do not change overnight.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_366.wav|42|I think we'll just keep it.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_135.wav|106|Margins are also in retreat.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_291.wav|94|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
DUMMY2/p241/p241_119.wav|86|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_364.wav|51|Now it has become a big picture.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_197.wav|83|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_369.wav|36|She said they would appeal.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_255.wav|79|You don't see that.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_252.wav|35|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_304.wav|77|We can work all night.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_028.wav|82|The racist abuse was terrible.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_267.wav|5|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_081.wav|70|What has changed?
DUMMY2/p301/p301_306.wav|91|We're talking about creating an attractive neighbourhood.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_329.wav|97|I feel it is very irrational.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_145.wav|14|You are a gambling man.)
DUMMY2/p244/p244_153.wav|78|Others are expected to follow the lead.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_224.wav|95|It comes from reflection or thinking.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_120.wav|28|Today's meeting was open and friendly.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_327.wav|53|I try to be open to experience.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_104.wav|66|We are trying to establish a date.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_030.wav|97|The council has been open and transparent.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_106.wav|11|Let that be their memorial.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_009.wav|44|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_291.wav|90|He wrote the letter two days before he died.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_319.wav|49|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_212.wav|5|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_075.wav|4|Craig is a major concern for us.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_143.wav|22|All things are possible if you believe.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_114.wav|80|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_231.wav|67|We've got the bronze.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_180.wav|76|We won't do that.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_178.wav|73|One was a lawyer.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_344.wav|87|Does it matter ?
DUMMY2/p253/p253_363.wav|70|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_300.wav|93|Saturday's match was fairly straightforward.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_411.wav|35|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_209.wav|16|I might come back.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_442.wav|89|I hate the word.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_047.wav|79|They need to be helped.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_130.wav|21|It is open season on the Old Firm.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_129.wav|12|Does a firefighter have to be killed?
DUMMY2/p275/p275_001.wav|40|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_011.wav|63|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_296.wav|4|Then there's the Old Firm.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_329.wav|1|I am not in denial.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_391.wav|78|Does it matter ?
DUMMY2/p234/p234_309.wav|3|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_254.wav|22|The final stage is paranoia.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_295.wav|47|We have to sort it out ourselves.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_253.wav|61|We were extremely poor.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_311.wav|36|He was at home with his pals.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_384.wav|10|After the match, do you ?
DUMMY2/p282/p282_097.wav|83|I love the Dome.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_298.wav|68|I felt the head was very like me.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_282.wav|99|It was a virus.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_271.wav|39|I didn't see the point.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_049.wav|12|It is also central to the unfolding drama.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_260.wav|15|It was, however, the wrong side.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_332.wav|16|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_179.wav|75|Had this been common practice ?
DUMMY2/p233/p233_335.wav|84|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_370.wav|85|There is a changing of the guard.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_174.wav|87|I will never change our policy on paying appearance money.
