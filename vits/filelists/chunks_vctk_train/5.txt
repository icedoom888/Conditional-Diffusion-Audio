DUMMY2/p284/p284_419.wav|16|Is there any prospect of this happening?
DUMMY2/p274/p274_020.wav|32|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. )
DUMMY2/p283/p283_050.wav|95|Clearly, they had other problems.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_343.wav|21|It wasn't good, but we'll get better.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_354.wav|47|There is no room for error.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_049.wav|74|It is somewhere to be.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_295.wav|21|Strikers like to go to the ground.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_350.wav|68|People tended to stay there for some time.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_277.wav|74|I've done it all.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_003.wav|54|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_325.wav|59|You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_328.wav|27|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_349.wav|58|I can't stop people thinking.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_318.wav|93|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_105.wav|20|He takes the job.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_011.wav|24|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_267.wav|44|I feel very strongly about that.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_091.wav|18|I decided to take my time.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_190.wav|63|His son is a local legend.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_080.wav|95|The tournament has now been cancelled.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_111.wav|86|It's not a new concept in jazz.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_022.wav|105|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_067.wav|106|Then they scored two goals to win.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_294.wav|87|Downing Street insisted, We have made clear that the deadline is absolute.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_375.wav|55|If you believe in the blue and white.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_144.wav|12|Since then, my life has been turned upside down.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_418.wav|48|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_220.wav|23|Who would be in that desert?
DUMMY2/p297/p297_305.wav|42|Who do you think you are?
DUMMY2/p307/p307_144.wav|22|This was not just incongruous.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_389.wav|18|It is not designed to kill.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_326.wav|69|These days are long gone.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_189.wav|17|But even without either, Glasgow will be outstanding.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_046.wav|27|Is a drug dealer?
DUMMY2/p263/p263_323.wav|39|We're not an employment agency.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_286.wav|11|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_227.wav|24|Harry Potter has lost his magic.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_177.wav|93|There is no point in looking any further.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_372.wav|47|Now, though, he has an incentive.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_172.wav|9|Mr Blunkett said he was deeply concerned by the ruling.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_254.wav|76|We feel it sends out the wrong message.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_011.wav|17|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_145.wav|105|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_219.wav|93|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_102.wav|21|I am not a doctor.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_025.wav|55|Then nine minutes before half time Kenny Miller struck.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_382.wav|100|Alex Ferguson is the same.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_261.wav|107|He also received a medal of honour.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_316.wav|38|There are two games to go after that.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_177.wav|10|What do we want to do that for ?
DUMMY2/p276/p276_382.wav|106|His background is firmly in venture capital.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_379.wav|50|The pair are very much in love.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_386.wav|92|That, however, is only part of the story.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_140.wav|81|The idea is simple.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_006.wav|53|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_115.wav|26|Who would have?
DUMMY2/p287/p287_180.wav|77|We've had great things in the past.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_371.wav|84|We shall not be moved.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_402.wav|17|I'm happy to contribute to that.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_400.wav|66|She can't say where she was, what she did.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_408.wav|91|I saw some good things.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_217.wav|50|He has a lot of skill.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_227.wav|51|Asylum is an entirely different issue to race.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_148.wav|79|Or someone wants to say something different.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_080.wav|61|It may well have been.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_310.wav|4|It was the climax of the thing.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_282.wav|27|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_151.wav|96|It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_384.wav|23|I have chosen to do this research.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_319.wav|86|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_162.wav|33|No other vehicle was involved in the incident.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_242.wav|100|This is a family club.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_147.wav|44|I always knew she was funny.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_126.wav|104|He has gone through the process before.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_339.wav|28|We gave them the goal.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_190.wav|18|They have the players to do it.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_214.wav|18|We're not getting involved.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_328.wav|31|We agreed to disagree.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_276.wav|54|However, Sharon rejected the claims.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_174.wav|63|Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_237.wav|38|After that it is up to the boss.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_128.wav|59|I was awful.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_200.wav|25|I have a cold.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_161.wav|94|Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_067.wav|72|You probably have never seen them before.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_472.wav|100|It's been a long, long journey.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_112.wav|22|And that is our first victory in Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_102.wav|6|It was entirely justified.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_426.wav|36|The professor is in no doubt.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_123.wav|39|Such actions are rarely popular.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_230.wav|9|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_019.wav|42|Since then physicists have found that it is not a reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_178.wav|34|The next thing will be cutting journey times.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_098.wav|88|This is a one-off.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_264.wav|82|It doesn't look good.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_350.wav|59|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_285.wav|12|I need them to set my career.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_229.wav|98|She told me to stop.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_092.wav|68|These things are important for clubs like ourselves.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_027.wav|69|They have no history.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_262.wav|6|Where was the point in all this?
DUMMY2/p269/p269_236.wav|94|Of course, that is not the whole story.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_019.wav|81|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_138.wav|66|There were no casualties.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_217.wav|57|Even a shopping trip was a cause for excitement.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_143.wav|12|He's been the key to everything.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_200.wav|104|When it is ready, it will be signed.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_146.wav|19|But the championship is not over yet.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_272.wav|12|We have to sort it out ourselves.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_013.wav|102|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_158.wav|34|The motive for the shooting was not known.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_126.wav|82|The Tories election campaign has certainly been colourful.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_443.wav|50|They made a huge impression on me.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_295.wav|63|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_172.wav|33|He will be greatly missed.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_178.wav|37|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_076.wav|42|I had a tie in my hand.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_277.wav|52|I think the shares are good value.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_062.wav|82|If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_463.wav|65|That does not take much training.)
DUMMY2/p345/p345_077.wav|82|Saturday's match was fairly straightforward.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_344.wav|8|So, did she meet him ?
DUMMY2/p233/p233_338.wav|84|Nobody else was with me.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_069.wav|98|After that, the Scottish Parliament will run the show.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_280.wav|69|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_076.wav|3|We can all make a mistake.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_394.wav|29|I wanted to go out on a high.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_070.wav|69|They are real.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_350.wav|22|And Michael was just great.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_388.wav|39|You have to rely on each other.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_207.wav|46|Early warnings could help, but it's a scary thought.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_094.wav|72|He was jailed for five years.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_413.wav|19|Her grand-daughter was uninjured.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_122.wav|106|New Zealand rugby is totally different.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_392.wav|17|We knew their goalkeeper would take the chance.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_215.wav|87|The whole thing was just unreal.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_001.wav|76|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_110.wav|26|This film will be totally awesome.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_246.wav|99|The scene is about this?
DUMMY2/p311/p311_396.wav|4|She is fulfilled by it.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_076.wav|103|I wish they, too, would get a grip.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_329.wav|34|I didn't know there was anything wrong.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_222.wav|72|We have a team to reach the final.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_089.wav|80|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_192.wav|14|I will have to order its destruction.)
DUMMY2/p288/p288_202.wav|47|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_140.wav|45|It is huge.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_418.wav|51|As for Owen, class is permanent.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_064.wav|99|It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_308.wav|61|However, he had not yet been charged in connection with the robbery.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_297.wav|18|The rest is his own.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_401.wav|11|Or so it seemed.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_124.wav|19|Life, as many people know it, in other words.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_026.wav|43|That's no bad thing.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_088.wav|88|The couple had one daughter.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_212.wav|45|The second is the reaction of the Hibs fans.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_350.wav|31|I kept going for her.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_331.wav|72|Our strategy is straightforward.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_117.wav|0|Something will be done by corporate bodies.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_217.wav|47|A career as a doctor is on hold.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_128.wav|41|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_171.wav|48|Those three weeks are totally lost.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_269.wav|13|It is a very beautiful city.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_333.wav|9|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_358.wav|58|A review group will report on Tuesday.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_237.wav|92|We have seen the failure of politics.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_338.wav|73|That would help.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_101.wav|64|Happily we found it in the library.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_057.wav|78|Clearly, they had other problems.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_205.wav|82|The devil, of course, will be in the detail.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_152.wav|76|I am ashamed of them.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_227.wav|72|He was dead on arrival at the hospital.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_197.wav|46|Because of this, he feels the hearing had been unfair.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_364.wav|22|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_222.wav|57|It's been a good year.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_313.wav|84|The election is total confusion and chaos.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_412.wav|107|Like anyone else, he has to take his time.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_357.wav|46|By social devices, the two groups are coming together.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_381.wav|48|We have not been approached.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_079.wav|63|Their mandate is to target inflation.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_379.wav|20|I am a wealthy person.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_297.wav|90|The home was now under new management.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_370.wav|58|See it while you can.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_023.wav|93|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_278.wav|21|But it's not the end of Scottish football.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_051.wav|57|Mary Archer is almost too clever.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_154.wav|72|This is our Olympics.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_039.wav|59|It was clear.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_087.wav|106|Webster was brought up in Glasgow.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_214.wav|44|All the teachers are Afghan refugees.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_376.wav|40|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_153.wav|16|We are on a four-year mission.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_195.wav|100|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_016.wav|23|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_116.wav|79|You should enjoy the day.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_184.wav|64|In a way he was.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_101.wav|67|She has so much to offer.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_381.wav|51|He had no answer.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_236.wav|29|They all made the European Ryder Cup team.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_067.wav|52|He was failed by his health authority.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_319.wav|39|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_161.wav|6|I feel a little betrayed.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_349.wav|40|She is free.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_170.wav|86|He was a crazy man.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_356.wav|74|But he did not appear.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_402.wav|11|I will have to think about it.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_110.wav|51|There are nine people here now.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_237.wav|26|It's quite nice.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_230.wav|77|And thought we would get away with it.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_404.wav|18|I'm delighted with our performance.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_061.wav|24|Let's hope that it does.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_329.wav|60|He has changed my life forever.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_359.wav|51|One was a lawyer.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_064.wav|30|Both these events occurred on Wednesday night.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_297.wav|83|Eight new hospitals are set to be built.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_411.wav|47|The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_232.wav|104|I'm not a little girl.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_158.wav|2|I will tell you.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_048.wav|64|Peter, of course, refuses to conform.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_010.wav|45|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_348.wav|13|It gives us something to work on.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_274.wav|95|That takes a lot of courage.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_120.wav|14|There's still plenty time left.)
DUMMY2/p243/p243_345.wav|53|Neither police nor hotel management had any record of the incident.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_207.wav|60|The baby was dead.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_073.wav|50|Both sides have been hit by injury.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_102.wav|13|So far this season this approach is working.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_092.wav|93|She told The Herald.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_131.wav|95|It is a delight on every level.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_008.wav|59|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_103.wav|9|They had to be cut from the wreckage.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_193.wav|39|I thought he did very well.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_232.wav|91|That's the key issue isn't it?
DUMMY2/p231/p231_088.wav|50|He's been hit by it.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_100.wav|11|I want to be there by right.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_084.wav|41|The price cuts are really exciting.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_233.wav|66|Usually, you should leave it alone in the box.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_029.wav|1|That was their attitude.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_244.wav|9|They should come forward.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_296.wav|11|That was the theory, anyway.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_021.wav|91|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_042.wav|70|Dancing was her life.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_198.wav|45|He has a lot of experience as captain in his career.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_281.wav|32|This will look at consumer attitudes.)
DUMMY2/p246/p246_198.wav|5|It's all about money, money, money.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_336.wav|19|He pleaded for caution.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_216.wav|24|It was worth a photograph.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_374.wav|46|They were only there for three weeks.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_379.wav|77|I do not like to lose.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_226.wav|74|Sub Not Used, McCormick.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_457.wav|36|The men are very worried.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_249.wav|70|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_355.wav|19|Next league matches, Motherwell - Dundee United.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_071.wav|74|They do not deliver.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_231.wav|93|They are the innocent victims.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_088.wav|0|It's for that reason he should resign.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_209.wav|49|That has not changed.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_213.wav|18|It has certainly paid off for him.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_381.wav|100|You did not see it.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_424.wav|98|This is a matter of life and death.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_360.wav|66|Nobody ever gets to see them.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_258.wav|34|The conversion didn't go over either.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_329.wav|82|His father said, My son was lucky.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_189.wav|93|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_385.wav|27|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_361.wav|25|Well, the big day has arrived.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_148.wav|10|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_026.wav|9|But it failed.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_008.wav|51|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_085.wav|5|It will be tight.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_346.wav|96|Tiger is the exception.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_039.wav|98|That gives us something to kick against.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_307.wav|10|We feel very comfortable in this international environment.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_052.wav|17|I fell to the ground.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_045.wav|107|Whatever the final decision, one thing is certain.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_136.wav|59|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_102.wav|100|We are also looking for new licences.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_077.wav|25|It seemed so personal.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_066.wav|51|They were later discharged from hospital.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_378.wav|76|That's the only thing that matters.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_186.wav|18|It separates the men from the boys.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_232.wav|103|This represents a tough game for us.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_156.wav|76|If so, we want to hear from them.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_105.wav|68|Referees are easy targets.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_264.wav|55|That's the danger when you have to play too many young players.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_158.wav|47|It is not too late to get on board.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_327.wav|57|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_406.wav|27|In a way he was.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_116.wav|3|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_311.wav|32|Clydesdale Bank declined to comment.)
DUMMY2/p247/p247_140.wav|14|This is the highlight of my career.)
DUMMY2/p345/p345_004.wav|82|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_356.wav|16|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_027.wav|50|Because we do not need it.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_258.wav|95|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_138.wav|103|The Devil is the creator of weapons.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_201.wav|53|One in eight workers in Edinburgh works for Standard Life alone.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_055.wav|25|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_125.wav|37|Had this been common practice ?
DUMMY2/p261/p261_011.wav|100|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_188.wav|0|I had come back from London.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_350.wav|91|And Michael was just great.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_344.wav|96|He has to learn.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_337.wav|32|There will be good prospects ahead.)
DUMMY2/p243/p243_095.wav|53|He will be a very hard act to follow.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_284.wav|22|That's when you hope to take advantage.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_264.wav|61|There's the mix.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_295.wav|93|The Government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_199.wav|21|Or so it is hoped.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_004.wav|46|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_196.wav|79|They will be very physical.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_275.wav|64|It was a journey into a new life.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_158.wav|65|We have come a long way since then.)
DUMMY2/p351/p351_378.wav|33|They promised to fight the plans.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_099.wav|17|Peter doesn't want to leave.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_088.wav|90|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_296.wav|13|Three hours later, the man was free.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_317.wav|75|That is the real test.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_043.wav|84|That means an extra two years.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_024.wav|55|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_309.wav|53|It happened on average once a week this year.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_117.wav|37|Many others are subjected to violence by men.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_146.wav|97|No details of the talks were given.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_274.wav|63|Scoring in our first game was a bonus for me.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_185.wav|5|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_096.wav|49|I would think they are just behind them.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_051.wav|44|This guy is never going to give up.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_073.wav|89|He was popular.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_391.wav|74|The children are fine.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_358.wav|5|Their time has gone.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_006.wav|25|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_198.wav|93|There was no option.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_165.wav|70|I've put my own money into this project.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_019.wav|4|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_066.wav|30|A young Briton had a lucky escape.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_272.wav|52|The lack of joint action left many analysts concerned.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_045.wav|52|Does it matter ?
DUMMY2/p260/p260_176.wav|81|Almost the day after the election, the battle lines were drawn.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_134.wav|80|We're hopefully going to act as a catalyst for that.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_154.wav|86|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_203.wav|65|That first victory made a huge difference to my career.)
DUMMY2/p276/p276_462.wav|106|It was very positive and very helpful.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_215.wav|70|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_195.wav|48|The Yugoslav army will still be there.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_397.wav|19|Instead, it is back to the drawing board.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_437.wav|24|The trial will open today.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_112.wav|88|The outcome is now in our own hands.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_394.wav|70|But, in fact, the reverse is true.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_444.wav|32|They are interior designers and architects.)
DUMMY2/p277/p277_138.wav|89|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_274.wav|30|He always has been, since his early days with Scottish Opera.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_097.wav|68|I've done it almost like a variety show.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_417.wav|7|It is a serious offence of reckless conduct.)
DUMMY2/p274/p274_285.wav|32|None of this work is guaranteed.)
DUMMY2/p247/p247_019.wav|14|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. )
DUMMY2/p318/p318_290.wav|19|Painful, but only because it's true.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_263.wav|32|We have no information on Iraq.)
DUMMY2/p243/p243_317.wav|53|He will just go on doing his job.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_199.wav|81|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_224.wav|41|They are the innocent victims.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_036.wav|50|But he can turn on the charm.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_033.wav|76|This is a disaster averted for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_286.wav|34|We remain confident that Danny is still alive.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_021.wav|27|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_122.wav|46|You can cope with it.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_252.wav|53|The rise has come too late for some.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_086.wav|104|We have to focus on what is important.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_227.wav|104|Are we going mainstream?
DUMMY2/p230/p230_223.wav|35|How do you get it back ?
DUMMY2/p273/p273_360.wav|56|Is there a waiting list ?
DUMMY2/p276/p276_284.wav|106|The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_206.wav|18|It is part of our heritage.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_374.wav|50|There is no deal as yet.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_072.wav|43|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_283.wav|51|Nothing can bring back their son.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_147.wav|98|He looked at me before replying.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_171.wav|107|There is no date on this document.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_389.wav|6|It wasn't very pretty to watch.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_116.wav|26|It is a delight on every level.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_093.wav|78|However, a ruling will not come before next week.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_203.wav|94|It was good fun.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_309.wav|20|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_322.wav|84|We agreed to disagree.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_436.wav|65|It was a hard fight.)
DUMMY2/p329/p329_184.wav|103|Or so we have long assumed.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_142.wav|54|Other people also tried.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_196.wav|49|We should savour this, because it's unlikely ever to happen again.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_466.wav|63|He was backed by Downing Street.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_187.wav|19|Her daughter is getting married.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_282.wav|20|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_382.wav|53|The doctors say that he will be fine for the performance next week.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_326.wav|67|I am very happy to be here.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_323.wav|3|And he's the real thing.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_072.wav|21|We could have got three medals.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_155.wav|27|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_399.wav|66|Things are going very well.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_201.wav|90|The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_357.wav|37|And the World Cup has not even begun.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_085.wav|61|Someone who cares
DUMMY2/p257/p257_427.wav|105|I was just overwhelmed.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_123.wav|19|There is a great carry over value.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_423.wav|56|That means that nobody can do it.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_266.wav|83|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_352.wav|38|You have to audition for jobs.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_292.wav|10|It has become a way of life.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_404.wav|38|We are going to change our party.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_360.wav|19|A handful of those restrictions are in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_341.wav|105|The pressure is on Celtic in the main.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_186.wav|37|Scottish football is finally on its way back.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_135.wav|52|Her research is the second piece by Edinburgh University scientists highlighted recently.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_469.wav|50|However, he held out little hope that the Government would take action.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_329.wav|32|I was brought up in a mining background.)
DUMMY2/p304/p304_237.wav|72|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_186.wav|72|Or is it the European approach?
DUMMY2/p259/p259_290.wav|7|Blair is very positive at European Councils.)
DUMMY2/p360/p360_032.wav|60|Lose, and they would be ridiculed.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_403.wav|68|The new work will begin in the autumn.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_019.wav|68|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_213.wav|107|Officials say the city must achieve this.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_456.wav|36|We could hardly believe it.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_159.wav|2|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_375.wav|31|He could not be contacted for further comment yesterday.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_321.wav|77|I have signed a contract.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_114.wav|41|It was really enjoyable on Saturday.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_020.wav|37|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_317.wav|1|Axis itself was created from that exercise.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_002.wav|74|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_093.wav|44|He didn't have time for any other hobbies.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_204.wav|19|Election results are expected soon.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_318.wav|29|The weather forecast isn't good.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_205.wav|11|Smith has not let him down.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_240.wav|51|They scored a goal, but we have to keep playing.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_245.wav|23|We live by the rule of law.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_348.wav|78|We never played at all.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_400.wav|22|Anyway, even if they didn't it wouldn't have mattered.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_289.wav|107|We also hope to meet the Ulster Unionists.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_190.wav|8|They need to look after themselves.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_435.wav|48|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_376.wav|53|It used to be all hard sell.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_437.wav|100|It was the climax of the thing.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_212.wav|26|A Grampian Police spokesman said.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_247.wav|41|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_071.wav|63|Then followed a bout of flu.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_176.wav|0|He played it like a veteran.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_053.wav|41|It's a blessing.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_074.wav|10|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_219.wav|32|People should make their own decisions.)
DUMMY2/p239/p239_377.wav|48|Commitment is released on Liberty.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_087.wav|15|One is investment, one is reform.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_087.wav|75|Does it matter ?
DUMMY2/p261/p261_395.wav|100|You have to rely on each other.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_155.wav|31|The weaknesses are few.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_163.wav|10|It's never great to finish second.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_428.wav|50|Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_304.wav|54|His signature is his handwriting.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_326.wav|10|McNaughton was not so sure.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_057.wav|107|I wouldn't want to miss that chance.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_289.wav|72|What are the barriers?
DUMMY2/p305/p305_394.wav|54|John Reid, the Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday appealed for restraint.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_188.wav|70|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_082.wav|105|He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_218.wav|13|No-one expected that their parents would stay.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_154.wav|34|I have come here to fight the boxer, not the fans.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_039.wav|7|I feel so desperately sorry for Gordon and Sarah.)
DUMMY2/p226/p226_200.wav|43|Is that success?
DUMMY2/p314/p314_144.wav|51|Scotland has been caught in the crossfire.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_042.wav|88|Since then it has become a tradition.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_027.wav|76|This year it will be Billy Crystal.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_323.wav|52|We still think this trade is on the increase.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_343.wav|38|He's a key player in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_170.wav|55|The second failed completely.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_088.wav|1|I didn't know the company all that well, or the dancers.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_232.wav|60|We are being realistic about the challenges ahead.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_231.wav|27|He said the winner had been chosen by consensus.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_289.wav|66|We are aware of the two incidents.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_076.wav|31|What has changed?
DUMMY2/p231/p231_418.wav|50|There will be widespread support on all sides.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_004.wav|58|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_266.wav|71|"She has every confidence in his performance of his duties."
DUMMY2/p231/p231_275.wav|50|It does not work that way in Scottish football.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_298.wav|78|What form did that take ?
DUMMY2/p231/p231_129.wav|50|If not, a deal could take many months.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_015.wav|102|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war on heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_124.wav|42|United were in control without always being dominant.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_199.wav|58|I'm not afraid of that.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_410.wav|62|He supported the decision to review the decision.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_155.wav|57|It opens the door to the Champions League.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_356.wav|4|I hope they will understand the reasons.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_263.wav|67|The pensioners did not want to know.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_041.wav|32|He looks like an Afghan.)
DUMMY2/p247/p247_298.wav|14|They were worth the money.)
DUMMY2/p256/p256_022.wav|90|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_087.wav|48|He has really done well.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_228.wav|95|That is the real test.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_179.wav|17|The club are feeling no different today.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_083.wav|47|New Zealand rugby is totally different.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_197.wav|17|Whenever we heard about this decision we protested.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_304.wav|38|Sightings were replaced by rumours.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_285.wav|104|He had asked if they had the script.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_241.wav|78|All will be revealed in due course.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_411.wav|34|We are seeking funds from government departments.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_214.wav|30|It may mean more money, but we don't need the money.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_399.wav|4|It is the end of an era.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_382.wav|67|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_385.wav|2|They deserved the win.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_361.wav|40|I was conceived in Aberdeen.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_018.wav|32|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. )
DUMMY2/p252/p252_397.wav|55|He has worked hard over the years.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_007.wav|38|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_335.wav|72|This has come as a shock to everyone.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_061.wav|35|But the challenge is in the US.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_349.wav|67|The visual arts committee took this decision in December.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_028.wav|66|It is only one night, after all.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_281.wav|88|He was at the game, and he is indeed.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_156.wav|49|Filtering through this material a composite finally emerges.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_141.wav|28|We are not going to forget.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_249.wav|87|This action reflects a slump in bookings.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_395.wav|27|By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_006.wav|60|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_084.wav|23|However, it's good to turn the page.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_091.wav|105|We must look forward.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_265.wav|66|I gave him a way out, and he took it.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_342.wav|25|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_430.wav|27|There is no suggestion of any sinister intent on his behalf.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_290.wav|55|Donald felt it would be an appropriate thing to do.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_055.wav|0|So I liked the challenge.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_091.wav|81|She is an expert on medical ethics.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_314.wav|101|We believe the world has too many refugees already.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_395.wav|65|We learned two things.)
DUMMY2/p294/p294_066.wav|104|What kind of inclusion is that?
DUMMY2/p270/p270_445.wav|8|I think the goalkeeper should have gone.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_071.wav|9|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_090.wav|34|You are not in any kind of trouble.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_362.wav|98|I am a player.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_113.wav|41|And I thought - we have to do something with this.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_056.wav|44|Several hundred people attended yesterday.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_167.wav|52|However, it's possible that Dick can influence some Dutch players to go there.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_130.wav|87|Manager Neil Cooper revealed yesterday.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_304.wav|5|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_040.wav|99|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_143.wav|70|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_321.wav|80|I came into this world with nothing.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_244.wav|45|They may yet have the last laugh.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_356.wav|39|After the match, do you ?
DUMMY2/p264/p264_155.wav|65|The second failed completely.)
DUMMY2/p301/p301_162.wav|91|I understand the medical concerns.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_173.wav|63|That would open the gates of hell.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_247.wav|49|It needs to be sorted out by Easter.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_261.wav|60|The distinction is also supported by doctors.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_399.wav|102|Equally the employee could claim a public interest.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_026.wav|25|He said the matter had been neglected in the past.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_363.wav|69|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_237.wav|64|There were two things going on at once.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_039.wav|45|It was ugly.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_282.wav|90|I saw it at a ruck.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_367.wav|84|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_367.wav|76|The hearing in Edinburgh continues.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_100.wav|46|But who shot the president?
DUMMY2/p226/p226_202.wav|43|They are in the euro.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_244.wav|63|The output price index in December was unchanged on November.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_025.wav|45|The main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_381.wav|33|Finally, he paid for the movie.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_013.wav|70|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_100.wav|37|Both sides have been hit by injury.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_026.wav|22|They changed the world of music.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_220.wav|102|There are a lot of unanswered questions.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_032.wav|87|She is employed on short-term contracts.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_113.wav|51|This would not be my first choice.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_113.wav|60|They took a risk.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_408.wav|76|I want to keep him.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_196.wav|107|To which the only answer is, don't hold your breath.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_264.wav|16|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_119.wav|84|My office is bare.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_284.wav|56|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_138.wav|24|He is particularly happy with the size of the gallery.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_171.wav|87|What was the matter for concern ?
DUMMY2/p305/p305_172.wav|54|The actor has met with Mandela.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_429.wav|75|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_013.wav|69|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_138.wav|48|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_250.wav|34|So far he has not done so.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_035.wav|99|I expected these kind of questions.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_377.wav|28|That is the position the MoD has adopted.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_019.wav|102|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_091.wav|11|I am confident of the outcome this week.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_340.wav|93|I've not thought about it.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_200.wav|42|They tend to be female and retired.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_206.wav|8|The early physical reports were clear.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_197.wav|33|We expect a full house on the night.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_025.wav|85|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_316.wav|79|I'd never given up on myself.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_116.wav|28|What she will do next?
DUMMY2/p310/p310_416.wav|17|They've been here before.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_134.wav|73|The idea is simple.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_101.wav|17|Construction is due to begin in February.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_348.wav|66|The urgency is real.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_003.wav|26|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_123.wav|94|I thought it was a fantastic game.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_281.wav|16|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
DUMMY2/p317/p317_017.wav|97|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_261.wav|87|The Dutchman was pleased with the result.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_003.wav|11|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_389.wav|36|It is a simple equation.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_403.wav|10|Clark is back on top form.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_227.wav|107|plays in dark blue.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_075.wav|65|That is really all.)
DUMMY2/p351/p351_306.wav|33|Who can predict?
DUMMY2/p267/p267_290.wav|0|Stephen will get his first cap.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_391.wav|66|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_456.wav|95|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_137.wav|20|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_339.wav|29|So what happens next ?
DUMMY2/p232/p232_073.wav|96|There could be a way back.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_330.wav|70|I've got no secret.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_331.wav|31|It is a time bomb.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_211.wav|50|They are looking at flotation.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_071.wav|85|And if he hadn't become a musician?
DUMMY2/p255/p255_194.wav|31|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_251.wav|49|Who would have thought it?
DUMMY2/p333/p333_205.wav|64|It has come as a bombshell.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_374.wav|105|It is also claimed that he was murdered.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_427.wav|75|It is a case of pity for us.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_339.wav|56|It's wonderful to have won.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_423.wav|50|It was important to win the singles.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_005.wav|5|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_253.wav|69|Blood samples were taken.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_292.wav|40|There was a vacuum.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_337.wav|53|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
DUMMY2/p254/p254_121.wav|41|The fire was above the hole.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_226.wav|41|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_209.wav|57|Who will pay for this ?
DUMMY2/p316/p316_371.wav|85|The boys are very confident.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_014.wav|1|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_185.wav|9|We want to help them through it.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_367.wav|100|Finally came the moment of truth.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_318.wav|6|This decision is a farce.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_018.wav|11|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_238.wav|80|We were a load of rubbish.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_007.wav|48|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_379.wav|107|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_281.wav|3|I had to be into it.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_110.wav|55|He gets his moment.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_070.wav|73|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_007.wav|74|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_132.wav|66|Council officials are involved, along with the transport industry.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_142.wav|92|What did you learn in school today?
DUMMY2/p263/p263_078.wav|39|So, did she meet him ?
DUMMY2/p266/p266_380.wav|20|Colour was at the core of his life.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_085.wav|6|It was that kind of war.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_285.wav|101|We have to break that cycle.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_153.wav|26|I've put my own money into this project.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_375.wav|2|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_070.wav|67|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_175.wav|49|Stewart will travel with some confidence.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_230.wav|99|It's the same as Glasgow.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_219.wav|61|I began to pray.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_326.wav|98|We have great support.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_296.wav|96|He was obviously very genuine.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_119.wav|102|Completion is expected by October the following year.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_013.wav|5|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_300.wav|59|It's just not funny!
DUMMY2/p253/p253_326.wav|70|Three years ago he would have been.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_077.wav|68|He was obviously very genuine.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_209.wav|82|The Lobby is not failing.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_160.wav|96|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_086.wav|24|He put some colour into Scottish history.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_148.wav|45|It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_212.wav|10|Bombing is the easy option.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_009.wav|79|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_065.wav|80|You did not change overnight.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_063.wav|34|But it was a great decision he joked.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_225.wav|11|A contractor was due to be appointed yesterday.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_311.wav|72|It is a potential factor.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_017.wav|106|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_310.wav|44|The crowd was awesome.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_127.wav|106|Basically we lost the game because we were outplayed.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_407.wav|39|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_456.wav|14|Discussions will continue with the industry in Scotland.)
DUMMY2/p376/p376_155.wav|71|"We also enjoyed a lot of support."
DUMMY2/p286/p286_151.wav|63|Why change it ?
DUMMY2/p253/p253_343.wav|70|Yet he left a few days later.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_166.wav|18|My condition is not bad.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_076.wav|105|I've not thought about it.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_356.wav|102|No person was charged.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_100.wav|48|Sales are falling after years of growth.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_186.wav|102|A bit of match fitness is required.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_253.wav|98|Our policy is very clear on this issue.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_323.wav|31|That's the law of the land.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_315.wav|77|I was brought up in a mining background.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_389.wav|47|It's just outrageous.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_141.wav|60|That was the theory.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_250.wav|9|My future is in the marathon.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_384.wav|14|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.)
DUMMY2/p280/p280_410.wav|52|At the core of these issues are real people with real jobs.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_001.wav|51|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_167.wav|45|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_151.wav|81|I was on a roll.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_078.wav|25|Painful, but only because it's true.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_155.wav|42|They said we were out of touch.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_278.wav|35|None of this work is guaranteed.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_254.wav|47|It is very important that we get the balance right.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_274.wav|83|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_274.wav|25|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_217.wav|81|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_325.wav|50|Have a look at this lot.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_115.wav|91|They hoped to remain in the Edinburgh area.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_287.wav|45|It was a virus.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_122.wav|30|Glasgow is making inroads in some areas.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_096.wav|15|They have to work so hard.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_110.wav|17|My dad was working in Ayrshire.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_346.wav|94|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_203.wav|7|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.)
DUMMY2/p225/p225_291.wav|101|We would hope to make progress on that next year.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_026.wav|30|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_149.wav|103|I hadn't been looking after myself.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_257.wav|96|I can't get a job.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_082.wav|96|What has changed ?
DUMMY2/p285/p285_170.wav|2|He was a crazy man.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_092.wav|41|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_415.wav|106|Three weeks later, he resigned.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_282.wav|16|He will address the nation this evening.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_323.wav|85|Is that not uncanny?
DUMMY2/p300/p300_273.wav|102|The board has rejected her proposals.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_072.wav|105|I had my suspicions.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_054.wav|31|That's the truth.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_258.wav|94|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_028.wav|100|Life was like a timetable.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_117.wav|32|We had another last Tuesday.)
DUMMY2/p361/p361_138.wav|79|We needed someone and we now have him.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_123.wav|105|You can spend money on housing.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_304.wav|1|It became a national network.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_121.wav|36|We have a training class.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_158.wav|26|We have to move forward.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_152.wav|65|Did it work?)
DUMMY2/p270/p270_298.wav|8|I intended to look for another club on loan.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_247.wav|103|We must learn from the past.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_167.wav|3|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_146.wav|107|The women were on their way home yesterday.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_260.wav|24|Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_174.wav|101|He was a big influence on our decision to make this show.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_144.wav|96|The home side didn't stand a chance.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_310.wav|90|We have waited a long time for this.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_209.wav|94|But I am a worried man.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_261.wav|70|He has not created a Festival resource.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_046.wav|72|You have to have a sense of humour.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_121.wav|68|They will know they deserve to be there.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_150.wav|100|It was by the numbers.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_111.wav|16|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_306.wav|6|It is not just in Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_222.wav|77|Women were mostly notable by their absence.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_443.wav|95|I can almost pretend to be Scottish.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_277.wav|73|Dialogue is the key.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_239.wav|43|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_175.wav|43|It is not either national standards or local control.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_203.wav|63|Does the name matter ?
DUMMY2/p227/p227_259.wav|29|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_009.wav|100|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_358.wav|95|We will listen to any suggestion.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_085.wav|2|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_360.wav|52|They have the cash and the fire power.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_017.wav|0|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_190.wav|97|It's a drop in the bucket.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_249.wav|23|Nobody has been put on trial.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_381.wav|63|She is obviously very disappointed.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_041.wav|47|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_356.wav|33|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_127.wav|90|Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_267.wav|39|The whole point is to get the issue into the open.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_247.wav|1|They are also exploited by the markets.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_042.wav|73|Among them are many criminals.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_191.wav|15|I think he's done it a few times.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_264.wav|25|Blood samples were taken.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_051.wav|23|Stealing from the benefits system is no different.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_158.wav|82|We are trying to clarify the issues.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_431.wav|100|That's the way it works.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_256.wav|81|They must play for each other.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_421.wav|16|Eriksson would have approved.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_219.wav|35|It's all change at Kilmarnock.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_390.wav|17|I didn't actually believe them at first.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_174.wav|71|"This is a sad day."
DUMMY2/p285/p285_336.wav|2|I've got no secret.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_337.wav|72|It is not for me, though.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_376.wav|14|That is a crazy situation.)
DUMMY2/p305/p305_385.wav|54|The court had a number of empty seats.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_064.wav|95|Inspiring public confidence is crucial.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_292.wav|33|Brady lost to Sullivan one hole.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_280.wav|20|It's so awful.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_113.wav|62|Secondly, there are other options for patients.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_299.wav|54|That's how it worked in Bosnia.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_201.wav|28|It was worth a photograph.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_408.wav|20|Relief was beyond belief.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_120.wav|76|The Tory party will last.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_140.wav|5|He realises his mistake.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_070.wav|87|The regional newspapers have outperformed the national titles.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_359.wav|105|It does not even have a staff shortage.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_045.wav|93|On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_139.wav|32|It is a vicious circle.)
DUMMY2/p238/p238_209.wav|37|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_064.wav|61|You do not change overnight.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_286.wav|19|We are talking about the outskirts of London.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_385.wav|62|Yet the consensus is, it's worth it.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_094.wav|8|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_267.wav|65|I was totally wrong.)
DUMMY2/p374/p374_110.wav|11|That is very, very bad news for our nation.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_401.wav|105|She is superb.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_363.wav|83|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_167.wav|100|They could not match it.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_374.wav|84|He's a nice guy.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_170.wav|85|None of the opinions is good.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_356.wav|82|We had a good time.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_091.wav|58|There is a growing anger among the group.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_190.wav|2|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_320.wav|55|There was no consultation with the executive and no need for any such consultation.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_271.wav|102|It is worse because she suffers from angina.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_298.wav|83|There were no passengers on board.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_159.wav|13|We don't even know his name.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_312.wav|97|He confirmed there had been no warning.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_355.wav|101|Her husband was very concerned that it might be fatal.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_190.wav|48|Sloppy answers are to be avoided.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_313.wav|13|This means a great deal to the families.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_019.wav|48|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_198.wav|27|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_110.wav|16|It was a funny game.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_207.wav|9|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_250.wav|71|"The pensioners did not want to know."
DUMMY2/p283/p283_452.wav|95|But we have built a platform for next season.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_316.wav|91|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_385.wav|85|It's time to move on.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_357.wav|106|What are they for ?
DUMMY2/p231/p231_191.wav|50|We represent a wide range of society.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_243.wav|15|It doesn't make them evil.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_141.wav|81|That group reported just before Christmas.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_025.wav|48|They might have asked, for goodness sake.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_155.wav|67|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_395.wav|0|We shall not be moved.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_250.wav|64|There are two games to go after that.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_177.wav|83|We are the gateway to justice.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_277.wav|106|This wasn't just a big crowd.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_347.wav|81|I'm very lucky.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_370.wav|96|We will be homeless.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_161.wav|2|As, indeed, they would be.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_408.wav|34|It is too pretty, it is too small.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_197.wav|48|You've got to be vigilant.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_405.wav|25|The visual arts committee took this decision in December.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_034.wav|35|He really is a lovely man.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_146.wav|76|But the championship is not over yet.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_464.wav|7|It could cause a little bit of disruption.)
DUMMY2/p305/p305_252.wav|54|In the meantime, he added, prevention was the key.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_367.wav|104|Cooking is intricate and complex.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_167.wav|90|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_339.wav|83|She is free.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_399.wav|100|I felt the head was very like me.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_117.wav|101|We have no influence on the Government's policy on the euro.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_196.wav|4|They were kept there for a summer.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_126.wav|18|That imbalance was evident in their play.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_133.wav|52|No country has a similar training programme.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_415.wav|34|The Dutchman was suspended for two games.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_362.wav|72|I'd never be satisfied with just the relay.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_032.wav|63|They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_060.wav|12|We welcome the decisions of Mr Byers.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_210.wav|81|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_345.wav|79|Next League matches, Aberdeen - Dundee.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_402.wav|20|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_407.wav|37|And it had two seats.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_353.wav|39|Does it matter ?
DUMMY2/p273/p273_200.wav|56|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_330.wav|0|The election is total confusion and chaos.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_085.wav|1|I did not want any damage to us.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_359.wav|18|It looks as though there is no chance.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_150.wav|46|It is simple, really.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_054.wav|101|Four other charges were dropped.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_193.wav|57|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_089.wav|19|This gives us a lot of practice.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_088.wav|53|Celtic have a great base of travelling fans.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_037.wav|4|They did a very good job.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_077.wav|36|He also received a medal of honour.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_273.wav|98|I didn't expect to be in.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_140.wav|70|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_415.wav|60|Now, she will not be running at all.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_045.wav|51|He will emerge as a world leader.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_061.wav|6|He is not alone.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_280.wav|56|We have an excellent record of passenger growth and customer service.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_095.wav|96|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_059.wav|71|"It will take time."
DUMMY2/p293/p293_069.wav|23|A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_132.wav|100|I love the spectacle of cinema.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_264.wav|99|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_173.wav|34|That's just the way the game is evolving.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_313.wav|85|How would it work?
DUMMY2/p374/p374_149.wav|11|And so it should.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_033.wav|36|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_009.wav|92|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_391.wav|102|Form and structure are his music.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_049.wav|35|We have to bring in new players.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_170.wav|26|IT S the real thing, for sure.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_069.wav|82|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_016.wav|26|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_077.wav|55|How are you, sir ?
DUMMY2/p362/p362_159.wav|15|You never had it so good.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_072.wav|63|Both sides have been hit by injury.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_221.wav|70|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_323.wav|51|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_381.wav|62|However, this suggestion was turned down by the player.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_183.wav|50|The shooting created panic in the street.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_042.wav|38|I had enough on.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_336.wav|33|I lost a part of me.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_207.wav|81|In each case they were a goal down.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_144.wav|100|I would relish the prospect.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_332.wav|76|Three people were pronounced dead at the scene.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_324.wav|21|Otherwise we would all pay the price.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_081.wav|47|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_362.wav|79|He could have given them a lot.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_241.wav|98|Everyone must be focused on the league.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_117.wav|53|What do they want us to do ?
DUMMY2/p265/p265_027.wav|73|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_127.wav|96|It has removed a bit of guilt.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_173.wav|76|The stadium was full.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_381.wav|32|This hasn't happened in a vacuum.)
DUMMY2/p279/p279_275.wav|25|The script was funny.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_073.wav|76|It really has left the town in shock.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_045.wav|83|They want to be entertained.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_025.wav|0|A shortlist is to be drawn up next month.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_258.wav|90|That's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_267.wav|56|The demand is created by the supply.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_400.wav|28|It had until tomorrow to comply.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_287.wav|65|He followed the Italian route.)
DUMMY2/p339/p339_420.wav|18|I am also delighted for all the players.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_225.wav|56|He is obviously very dangerous.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_178.wav|95|The woman was his wife.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_264.wav|32|Either way, the investor retains the premium.)
DUMMY2/p361/p361_268.wav|79|He is not the only one.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_232.wav|97|I will be having talks with the workforce.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_233.wav|84|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_052.wav|55|Downing Street also rejected the calls for a European army.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_017.wav|7|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. )
DUMMY2/p273/p273_208.wav|56|IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_342.wav|36|The figures are bad, but not that bad.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_089.wav|33|That doesn't just happen, you have to build it.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_147.wav|106|We just have to adapt.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_077.wav|69|Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_016.wav|11|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_119.wav|40|Who would be a referee?
DUMMY2/p262/p262_389.wav|45|It was a breathtaking moment.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_391.wav|62|The only safe investment is cash.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_257.wav|87|Bin Laden was not mentioned.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_421.wav|33|A number of people could not speak English.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_071.wav|106|Let's not be too despondent.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_290.wav|40|I could never be cool.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_287.wav|18|What do you want.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_222.wav|28|I'm wondering what you feel about the youngest.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_420.wav|33|We will be pleased to talk to them.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_289.wav|82|Sure, he is the best player in the world.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_108.wav|1|The partnership was set up during the summer.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_195.wav|87|The Yugoslav army will still be there.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_387.wav|97|I never thought it would take this long.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_142.wav|23|However, the second goal was about to be delivered.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_042.wav|13|It doesn't come any better than this.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_195.wav|61|I've got good news and bad news for you.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_105.wav|40|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_299.wav|27|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_108.wav|19|I think the Scottish bid is very strong.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_095.wav|61|Until you hit the big games.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_393.wav|56|How do you take them away ?
DUMMY2/p376/p376_127.wav|71|"It will be too hot."
DUMMY2/p244/p244_218.wav|78|It decided to blame the media.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_069.wav|21|It was just awful.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_189.wav|91|The role was perfect for Russell.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_301.wav|50|Police were on the scene within minutes, but the killer had fled.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_216.wav|21|He has the edge.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_166.wav|34|There are so many people to thank.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_110.wav|95|However, a decision should be made before the end of August.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_393.wav|95|The pair are very much in love.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_280.wav|70|Dialogue is the key.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_343.wav|18|Only injury has prevented that happening before.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_361.wav|95|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_145.wav|44|But, clearly, it is crucial to understand that point.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_354.wav|105|It's a long process.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_141.wav|72|This advice was accepted by ministers.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_132.wav|95|We would make a start.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_356.wav|99|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_114.wav|32|It was a good game to watch.)
DUMMY2/p287/p287_338.wav|77|We are a peaceful people.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_202.wav|62|I believe that the answer is simple.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_139.wav|87|He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_250.wav|62|This kind of traffic is commonplace.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_027.wav|21|We will be back next year.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_233.wav|57|We are in the hat.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_260.wav|26|I was in jail for five years.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_130.wav|58|They really did a great job.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_007.wav|18|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_232.wav|29|He remains a main board director of Royal.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_108.wav|52|It took around three minutes from beginning to end.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_234.wav|55|We know the problems.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_019.wav|31|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_044.wav|52|Is it worth it ?
DUMMY2/p305/p305_316.wav|54|It is still holding good today.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_225.wav|33|I think it is a scandal.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_101.wav|21|We can only go up.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_045.wav|40|This represents a tough game for us.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_207.wav|10|It was a horrible thing to happen.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_141.wav|2|That group reported just before Christmas.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_364.wav|26|It was fit for royalty.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_017.wav|44|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_409.wav|47|We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_421.wav|20|Such as it is.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_365.wav|25|There is no signature.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_216.wav|37|It was started almost by accident.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_096.wav|91|We did not even get a free kick.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_047.wav|64|Do not forget about Monaco.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_358.wav|96|It's not that clear-cut.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_074.wav|62|After this, they were always in the driving seat.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_364.wav|50|It is not real life.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_370.wav|56|The salary changes are long overdue.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_127.wav|18|However, the drama was not over.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_156.wav|63|He's not a Celtic man.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_287.wav|103|Now, she has completed a family tradition.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_185.wav|83|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_021.wav|107|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_198.wav|35|I made a terrible start.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_374.wav|103|But we could not change his mind.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_110.wav|35|The arrival of the Scottish Premier League has also presented a problem.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_339.wav|96|They haven't got a hope.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_374.wav|91|Scottish life can be like this, too.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_390.wav|49|It's really nothing new.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_100.wav|9|No date has been set for the appeal.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_177.wav|58|His signature is his handwriting.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_409.wav|1|You guys are not out of it yet.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_035.wav|48|I might well have done so already.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_405.wav|62|This is my big break.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_153.wav|76|Glasgow, however, did not get a mention.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_317.wav|100|Holland won by five wickets.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_222.wav|99|A career as a doctor is on hold.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_174.wav|6|The only trouble is finding them.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_081.wav|26|Every time I play I do not understand their reaction.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_423.wav|8|If he saw somebody in trouble, he would try to help.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_027.wav|85|Have we tried everything?
DUMMY2/p341/p341_044.wav|66|This is a big advantage.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_152.wav|32|It was by the numbers.)
DUMMY2/p238/p238_097.wav|37|I was very pleased with them today, though.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_309.wav|85|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_387.wav|23|This isn't something the Labour Government has invented.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_260.wav|49|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_188.wav|13|One of these problems is the railways.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_392.wav|82|It was a game we had to win.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_318.wav|34|This rule is archaic.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_163.wav|30|Although it was expected, everyone is very, very angry.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_059.wav|20|We should have known.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_354.wav|93|The composer will conduct.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_160.wav|69|My Dad is a hero.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_228.wav|76|And then a funny thing happened.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_069.wav|3|The market is appalling for initial public offerings.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_003.wav|71|"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  "
DUMMY2/p248/p248_238.wav|99|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_237.wav|28|This kind of traffic is commonplace.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_220.wav|100|It has been like that all year for me.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_113.wav|56|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_117.wav|88|It was an important part of the course.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_100.wav|76|They've just got to believe in themselves.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_390.wav|50|It was fit for royalty.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_239.wav|30|They follow him everywhere.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_048.wav|60|Is he conscious?
DUMMY2/p263/p263_355.wav|39|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
DUMMY2/p311/p311_194.wav|4|Nobody could survive on that.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_305.wav|51|He knew it would cost him millions.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_174.wav|46|I didn't mean to kill her.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_189.wav|78|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_043.wav|53|He too started on the subs seats.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_344.wav|100|So what happens next ?
DUMMY2/p302/p302_210.wav|30|I was surprised by his response.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_012.wav|61|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_394.wav|106|He ended up a headmaster.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_061.wav|2|We should have known.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_403.wav|24|The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_008.wav|54|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_252.wav|61|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_004.wav|45|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_184.wav|59|They are in the euro.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_060.wav|10|It was exactly four months away.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_225.wav|93|But it will be sorted out this week.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_221.wav|0|Women were mostly notable by their absence.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_303.wav|62|Destruction came from within.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_158.wav|54|We are asking the council to think again.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_069.wav|35|It is a job creation scheme.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_331.wav|52|Having a Scot play against us would not achieve that.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_085.wav|94|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_252.wav|66|Have we not had the rainy season already?
DUMMY2/p258/p258_312.wav|26|He will go a long way.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_194.wav|26|It's the same old story.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_191.wav|83|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_214.wav|7|Did he trip ?)
DUMMY2/p285/p285_098.wav|2|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_037.wav|77|But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_307.wav|49|We must not go down that road.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_152.wav|72|The report will be launched in Glasgow today.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_012.wav|45|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_230.wav|86|It is not the message alone.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_221.wav|26|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_335.wav|25|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_352.wav|42|It is only one night, after all.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_114.wav|94|It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_182.wav|57|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_458.wav|63|The boys are mentally focused.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_046.wav|100|It will concentrate on the Thames Valley.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_018.wav|80|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_174.wav|38|Do yourselves a favour.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_160.wav|8|How independent is that ?
DUMMY2/p256/p256_238.wav|90|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_005.wav|4|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_223.wav|15|It is true, but it is only part of the issue.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_341.wav|44|Dancing will help his ankles and his feet.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_214.wav|74|He was outstanding today - the best player on the park.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_079.wav|13|It was very full anyway.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_273.wav|50|I'd never run for them.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_036.wav|62|Now the show is for public consumption.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_077.wav|54|That would open the gates of hell.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_347.wav|98|She becomes a mother.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_362.wav|49|It feels like too much.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_314.wav|10|I will never change our policy on paying appearance money.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_298.wav|7|It is also very valuable.)
DUMMY2/p249/p249_341.wav|80|I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_069.wav|37|The partnership was set up during the summer.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_079.wav|77|That was a great performance by the team.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_016.wav|78|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_267.wav|47|We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_431.wav|56|They are not left wing.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_293.wav|81|And it's a goodbye from him.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_117.wav|106|Those people must be accountable.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_134.wav|46|This year it will be Billy Crystal.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_341.wav|57|They should take their mobile phones.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_031.wav|13|Three days later, he was killed.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_380.wav|15|We are not getting him back.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_204.wav|24|We are going through difficult times.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_059.wav|13|I was completely knackered.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_414.wav|77|YOU thought it was a headache.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_045.wav|82|We would certainly consider the proposals.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_073.wav|18|Several others were absent.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_402.wav|70|He got his degree.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_193.wav|17|It is too early to speculate.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_101.wav|87|Are you going to win ?
DUMMY2/p345/p345_348.wav|82|I just know it's a lot.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_318.wav|49|The actors are confident and polished.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_105.wav|34|There's always a solution, somewhere you can meet in the middle.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_316.wav|66|I thought he was part of the camera.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_218.wav|86|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_233.wav|16|The car was just there.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_349.wav|91|Connell was standing there, ordering her to get up.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_129.wav|81|She said she would not welcome the flowers.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_394.wav|16|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_159.wav|44|The inquiry had been going on for months.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_268.wav|29|Do I think about them often ?
DUMMY2/p311/p311_263.wav|4|Our thoughts and prayers are with her family.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_108.wav|27|We have an election in eight days.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_129.wav|1|The party will make up its own mind.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_319.wav|8|What happened in that game ?
DUMMY2/p255/p255_306.wav|31|The company yesterday refused to comment.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_060.wav|46|It is a very special city.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_392.wav|18|Gordon Brown did not inherit a mess.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_016.wav|45|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_244.wav|104|They are not suitable.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_096.wav|54|We must keep our feet on the ground.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_250.wav|4|It's time to say enough is enough.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_002.wav|39|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_379.wav|95|He was then replaced by Ross.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_295.wav|4|I can't believe we didn't win that game.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_019.wav|84|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_224.wav|7|Little is known about them.)
DUMMY2/p340/p340_296.wav|74|I thought the dancing was over.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_225.wav|42|It was more like a Labour Party rally.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_007.wav|2|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_283.wav|67|It was a privilege to work for him.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_216.wav|100|We have an election in eight days.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_083.wav|13|Among them is his beloved teacher.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_418.wav|27|That may be.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_220.wav|105|We played them off the pitch.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_071.wav|32|Why do it otherwise ?)
DUMMY2/p326/p326_098.wav|28|It was exactly four months away.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_296.wav|92|We're not really commenting on that.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_340.wav|36|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_024.wav|63|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_293.wav|22|We just want to get stuck in now.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_372.wav|98|His behaviour today has been disgusting.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_095.wav|98|I believe in trade unions.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_254.wav|12|People would say, He thinks he can do that as well.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_184.wav|31|And I saw the light!
DUMMY2/p265/p265_005.wav|73|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_390.wav|62|It is part and parcel of it.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_148.wav|36|We have a clean bill of health.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_247.wav|69|So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_409.wav|11|I certainly will not settle.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_311.wav|6|There is another side to it.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_181.wav|73|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_233.wav|46|It is a big time for me.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_421.wav|14|He seems to be used to the attention.)
DUMMY2/p245/p245_145.wav|59|It has to be now.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_338.wav|3|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_026.wav|42|We have gone on about him no end.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_255.wav|49|Then there's the problem of sympathy.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_447.wav|37|I stayed away from the defence.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_010.wav|97|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_274.wav|67|We're in shock.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_282.wav|87|A winter of discontent awaits.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_235.wav|40|We will treat it like a World Cup match.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_153.wav|101|We have a clean bill of health.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_342.wav|13|I had to win this race.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_159.wav|17|It's never the same problem.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_207.wav|47|She should not be blamed.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_245.wav|54|How could anyone take issue with that?
DUMMY2/p287/p287_191.wav|77|It is hard to tell.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_023.wav|9|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_214.wav|40|IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_080.wav|107|You, the British people, are the boss.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_242.wav|75|You have to do your research.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_307.wav|6|It's never happened before.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_039.wav|83|Indeed, he does.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_182.wav|105|What has caused the demise of singing?
DUMMY2/p339/p339_402.wav|18|The first appeared to be successful.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_101.wav|15|This is complete nonsense.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_407.wav|76|As, indeed, they would be.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_274.wav|89|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_299.wav|101|They had to learn to work from the consumer back.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_002.wav|86|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_149.wav|59|Nobody did in those days.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_345.wav|97|That never seemed likely.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_189.wav|84|We are very concerned about controller fatigue.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_061.wav|16|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_155.wav|5|We are on a four-year mission.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_251.wav|29|They were in the wrong place at the wrong time.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_292.wav|73|Last night was a key episode.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_090.wav|76|The Parliament will make its own decisions.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_330.wav|34|It was very well received.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_285.wav|61|Immediate action must be taken.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_380.wav|77|There is no deal as yet.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_172.wav|86|It became a book by itself.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_088.wav|34|I enjoyed my work in the Scottish Office.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_041.wav|100|I was released after six days.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_169.wav|29|Why change it ?
DUMMY2/p259/p259_234.wav|7|I am delighted for Simon.)
DUMMY2/p360/p360_033.wav|60|It's something which is very important to me.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_325.wav|92|We're very close to making it in Europe.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_257.wav|80|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_264.wav|62|After all, this is the start of the giving age.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_296.wav|58|There were so many characters among them.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_089.wav|81|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_233.wav|85|It doesn't look good for her.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_240.wav|97|For example they could be in school uniform.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_293.wav|3|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_104.wav|25|I see no need for change.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_325.wav|14|His only reply was a laugh.)
DUMMY2/p252/p252_221.wav|55|The labour side had developed in the North area.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_150.wav|50|We have a clean bill of health.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_410.wav|4|This will be no easy option.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_448.wav|7|No-one wanted to run it tonight.)
DUMMY2/p271/p271_193.wav|27|One was a lawyer.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_057.wav|53|Her husband had been waiting for her return.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_063.wav|13|Our approach will be different.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_002.wav|61|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_165.wav|25|Tell it like it was?
DUMMY2/p231/p231_070.wav|50|This is an exciting new venture.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_276.wav|95|The irony was not lost.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_107.wav|32|We deserve a significant rise.)
DUMMY2/p364/p364_055.wav|88|The president took offence.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_324.wav|67|We are very strongly behind the bid.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_292.wav|69|Nothing is safe.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_310.wav|28|We will meet again.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_327.wav|86|I'd like to take the plunge.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_251.wav|87|These days are long gone.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_404.wav|87|Reaction from Scottish business leaders was mixed.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_099.wav|38|They chose to side with terror.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_309.wav|88|We're talking to him.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_211.wav|94|Saddam Hussein is a devil.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_178.wav|105|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_097.wav|95|The trick is to try it.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_381.wav|92|I could go on, but none of these things is true.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_418.wav|76|Would they work together again?
DUMMY2/p247/p247_324.wav|14|I was brought up in a mining background.)
DUMMY2/p336/p336_396.wav|98|And then he laughs.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_301.wav|86|This is a war over our home.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_096.wav|31|Get to know him.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_132.wav|74|Who do you think will win?
DUMMY2/p280/p280_375.wav|52|Otherwise, we might as well hold it now.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_007.wav|67|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_424.wav|17|Both reports appeared in the British Medical Journal.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_216.wav|39|The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_305.wav|78|There was a hole in it.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_251.wav|80|Scotland has competed in its own right in cycling.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_147.wav|95|And I have some advice for my old friend.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_210.wav|12|The next time he saw her, she was a different person.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_086.wav|7|How are you, sir ?)
DUMMY2/p280/p280_328.wav|52|He is not exactly a pretty child.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_101.wav|7|I did not have a bet on myself.)
DUMMY2/p316/p316_355.wav|85|Today the Kremlin would be contacted in seconds.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_368.wav|74|Things are on track.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_135.wav|17|No date has been set for the appeal.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_336.wav|3|This could be a mistake.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_291.wav|51|There is great demand for human cloning.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_414.wav|4|It worked well in Monaco.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_181.wav|90|Nothing is safe.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_015.wav|21|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_147.wav|82|It plainly does not work.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_337.wav|102|Instead they were openly attempting to be helpful.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_144.wav|46|I'm thinking, what would be easier?
DUMMY2/p374/p374_193.wav|11|The winner will be announced by early summer.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_345.wav|6|One was taken to hospital.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_071.wav|15|We have to move forward from now on.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_431.wav|48|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_228.wav|38|This tour is critical for New Zealand rugby.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_417.wav|54|We've still got a say in this.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_012.wav|52|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_211.wav|20|Work has started.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_235.wav|39|He remains a main board director of Royal.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_203.wav|89|Twaddle is a case in point.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_050.wav|39|People were determined to change the Government in the last election.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_107.wav|23|They will now have to justify their position.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_162.wav|107|The red card was okay.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_210.wav|60|They tried to give her advice.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_241.wav|16|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_409.wav|85|Taxation should be simplified.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_330.wav|12|We should savour this, because it's unlikely ever to happen again.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_164.wav|55|Nato has left them with no other option.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_300.wav|107|The frustration was showing.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_100.wav|87|What happened in that game ?
DUMMY2/p272/p272_053.wav|69|Is a drug dealer?
DUMMY2/p307/p307_001.wav|22|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_196.wav|90|It is a case of taking a risk.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_399.wav|1|However, there are no plans for injecting rooms.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_325.wav|22|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_208.wav|88|I am really, really happy.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_332.wav|51|No, no, it's not what you think.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_214.wav|19|We are a party for people, not against people.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_053.wav|23|We felt at the moment, it was not possible.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_344.wav|73|He could face a jail sentence.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_071.wav|27|Try to save us.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_230.wav|31|During the communist time they were very privileged.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_366.wav|48|This would include the GM food industry.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_402.wav|65|They have quick front players, but so do we.)
DUMMY2/p227/p227_116.wav|29|It is just a tax on employment.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_177.wav|60|Was the punishment excessive?
DUMMY2/p276/p276_098.wav|106|It was exactly four months away.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_023.wav|15|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_114.wav|85|She has the biggest part.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_363.wav|31|I wanted to help the poor people in Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_272.wav|36|He looked like a schoolboy.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_033.wav|81|This is the window.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_080.wav|69|He was at home with his pals.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_264.wav|26|It is also very valuable.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_145.wav|77|This action reflects a slump in bookings.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_340.wav|1|It would have to be backdated.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_268.wav|64|It had been in place since last July.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_313.wav|99|Off with their heads.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_045.wav|44|Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_061.wav|82|The classes are taking place.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_091.wav|103|I cannot speak on behalf of the IRA.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_262.wav|25|The warning is timely.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_033.wav|83|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_230.wav|18|It has to be put in context.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_183.wav|15|He is appealing to women.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_021.wav|71|"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. "
DUMMY2/p256/p256_271.wav|90|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_247.wav|32|There were no reports of casualties.)
DUMMY2/p333/p333_260.wav|64|THE arrow was aimed at the heart.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_330.wav|102|She should savour this, because it's unlikely ever to happen again.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_118.wav|62|It's a double whammy.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_381.wav|28|Therein lies the problem.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_360.wav|49|There is no openness.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_015.wav|36|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_204.wav|89|A Grampian Police spokesman said.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_024.wav|37|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_389.wav|15|I am not a frustrated actor.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_262.wav|23|The Commons is too outdated.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_294.wav|27|This is a national crisis.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_353.wav|6|I only found out about it this morning.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_198.wav|20|Who will pay for this?
DUMMY2/p271/p271_030.wav|27|However, the following year the cancer returned.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_180.wav|32|Do I think about them often ?)
DUMMY2/p233/p233_381.wav|84|It's just outrageous.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_318.wav|91|However, civil rights campaigners welcomed the ruling.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_278.wav|44|He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_247.wav|42|They chose the latter.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_068.wav|57|And if he hadn't become a musician ?
DUMMY2/p287/p287_249.wav|77|By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_429.wav|106|Low pay is endemic in the National Health Service.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_218.wav|60|That's a big reduction.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_317.wav|93|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_261.wav|58|And we still have to pay his salary.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_333.wav|58|I have a bunch of veterans.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_210.wav|2|In each case they were a goal down.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_241.wav|66|They have admitted they cannot meet that outlay.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_056.wav|13|I find the whole affair disturbing.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_122.wav|10|There will be no shortage of quality applicants.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_192.wav|29|They were seriously after him.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_096.wav|72|We will look into it.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_085.wav|46|In just a fortnight, however, everything has changed.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_184.wav|63|I'm pretty happy with the way I played.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_030.wav|30|It is a very special city.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_383.wav|82|Is he going to look after them?
DUMMY2/p329/p329_326.wav|103|There was barely a handful of chances.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_133.wav|36|First meeting was next week.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_041.wav|27|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_293.wav|56|And they were being paid ?
DUMMY2/p255/p255_110.wav|31|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_154.wav|90|She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_397.wav|56|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_066.wav|87|Debate was impassioned and furious.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_134.wav|10|You've got to be vigilant.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_021.wav|55|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored bands increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_092.wav|26|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_341.wav|60|There will be no backing down.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_256.wav|61|It would appear that it has not been a problem.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_226.wav|13|I don't think that's very fair.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_175.wav|8|I would be very keen on a move to Italy.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_338.wav|105|The salary changes are long overdue.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_377.wav|67|Talks are progressing.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_158.wav|24|What do we want to do that for ?
DUMMY2/p312/p312_059.wav|62|The trust has no magic wand.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_017.wav|73|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_083.wav|91|Cars are great for going long distances.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_116.wav|10|Maybe this battle has been.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_049.wav|106|Overall it has been deeply frustrating and disappointing.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_413.wav|0|Such an attack is bizarre.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_316.wav|15|They should be so lucky.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_450.wav|100|You have to see the work.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_124.wav|31|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_071.wav|36|How are you, sir ?
DUMMY2/p334/p334_363.wav|38|Her mother said, She didn't look very well at all.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_423.wav|19|The whole nation will be delighted.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_101.wav|86|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_141.wav|83|She died at her home.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_375.wav|22|He has changed my life for ever.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_325.wav|11|It will never happen.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_013.wav|82|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_121.wav|96|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_050.wav|94|I was inspired by two things.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_306.wav|94|Right up until a week ago we thought they were very keen.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_165.wav|23|The rear of the plane was on fire.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_040.wav|16|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_025.wav|83|But it failed.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_322.wav|20|A review is under way.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_345.wav|51|With us, we just want them to respond.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_113.wav|90|It's not perfect.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_003.wav|0|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_296.wav|94|I feel really sorry for the Iraqi people.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_373.wav|99|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_251.wav|72|They have the cash to do that.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_409.wav|10|The next few months will tell.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_360.wav|69|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_003.wav|77|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_308.wav|6|It was a deeper deception.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_073.wav|13|We are just being flooded.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_265.wav|47|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_359.wav|48|William Hague delighted his party.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_364.wav|95|The airport was even different.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_269.wav|18|They have to live with the risk.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_252.wav|47|It's a source of deep concern.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_142.wav|29|It opens the door to the Champions League.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_320.wav|24|We would hope to make progress on that next year.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_417.wav|107|Jock Brown is appointed as general manager.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_212.wav|32|Today we must not repeat that mistake.)
DUMMY2/p225/p225_177.wav|101|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_278.wav|17|Well, when did he ever refuse?
DUMMY2/p295/p295_382.wav|92|That sort of thing is long gone.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_177.wav|57|We've made a couple of albums.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_337.wav|58|I can assure you, the new Augusta National is exactly that.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_205.wav|80|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_044.wav|33|Who are the democrats?
DUMMY2/p231/p231_122.wav|50|We should not be surprised.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_113.wav|38|This meeting is the path to salvation.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_083.wav|84|They were badly prepared for it.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_067.wav|95|This is the year of the Tiger.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_378.wav|75|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_258.wav|96|He said he intended to push for a judicial review.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_187.wav|43|I had a train to catch.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_030.wav|10|The director will be present.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_157.wav|34|I've never seen them down here.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_103.wav|15|The Israeli government is destroying the peace process.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_434.wav|89|Last year, it was won by Jack McConnell, the first minister.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_168.wav|19|This one is a special case.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_008.wav|31|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_242.wav|95|I had relied on him.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_103.wav|82|This is his personal life.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_050.wav|103|Thames Valley police decided not to prosecute.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_343.wav|83|Yet he left a few days later.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_200.wav|53|The police insisted that they were standard issue.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_063.wav|33|We are the gateway to justice.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_177.wav|52|It's just a different way of life.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_401.wav|33|I am very excited about this season.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_213.wav|69|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_028.wav|14|Because we do not need it.)
DUMMY2/p266/p266_187.wav|20|Our team is just so young.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_423.wav|79|That was only the start.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_046.wav|13|That was not due to me.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_075.wav|16|Is there a new way forward?
DUMMY2/p287/p287_091.wav|77|No, the equipment is extra.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_047.wav|22|Lara is very, very much a girl.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_114.wav|1|Some were close to tears.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_297.wav|97|It would then be up to the judge.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_031.wav|60|There are two problems.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_240.wav|66|Bill is a mentor.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_400.wav|102|Six other people were injured.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_231.wav|16|But it's a subtle process.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_162.wav|94|His death was a tragic accident.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_079.wav|94|Even the one she loved.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_304.wav|56|The songs are just so good.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_274.wav|94|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_206.wav|80|There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_233.wav|18|No, they have played well.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_145.wav|101|Why change it ?
DUMMY2/p286/p286_026.wav|63|We must convince the citizens.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_053.wav|1|I was never going to play against Scotland.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_353.wav|17|That is of no use.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_360.wav|54|They must act now to tighten the rules.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_348.wav|42|Surely it can do better than that?
DUMMY2/p298/p298_316.wav|68|Tony Blair, can you see her face?
DUMMY2/p323/p323_341.wav|34|I was loving that little girl.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_186.wav|22|The early evidence suggests he did not.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_399.wav|27|But, in fact, the reverse is true.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_220.wav|55|There is no doubt there's room for us.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_357.wav|74|So he was anxious to try something new.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_168.wav|8|The strong performance is expected to continue.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_207.wav|68|The line-up is a tasty one.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_105.wav|94|It's not perfect.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_321.wav|28|Family, if you like.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_068.wav|5|Then followed a bout of flu.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_041.wav|92|I'm sure he would love it.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_304.wav|80|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_157.wav|87|But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_133.wav|14|The answer was in space.)
DUMMY2/p308/p308_151.wav|107|Insurance will be covered by the receiving galleries.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_418.wav|7|My view has now completely changed.)
DUMMY2/p306/p306_166.wav|12|Running costs are not subsidised by public money.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_370.wav|25|Again, we were lucky.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_383.wav|98|We are looking very hard at ourselves.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_202.wav|77|Does the name matter ?
DUMMY2/p250/p250_280.wav|24|I rejected the idea of a separate residence.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_298.wav|102|My view has now completely changed.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_415.wav|37|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_188.wav|50|This is the time to use it.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_133.wav|72|This is a wonderful honour for me.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_002.wav|105|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_321.wav|72|And then we got off the plane.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_125.wav|55|He is at peace with himself.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_274.wav|28|However, within five minutes they were able to celebrate.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_398.wav|6|I'm really looking forward to seeing the fight.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_415.wav|107|She took them for a term.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_096.wav|8|It was some time before she found out he was safe.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_079.wav|51|I go home only once.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_229.wav|73|It's quite nice.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_227.wav|42|She looked so young.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_167.wav|5|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_242.wav|81|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_211.wav|9|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_071.wav|88|They made a huge impression on me.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_211.wav|89|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_358.wav|45|Here is a weather forecast for the weekend.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_112.wav|9|This is a scheme that has a lot of potential.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_076.wav|18|A review is under way.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_165.wav|9|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_295.wav|73|The minister is the engineer.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_088.wav|13|Ending a tenancy is a last resort.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_081.wav|3|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_314.wav|103|However, in October another partnership was announced.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_209.wav|70|It had all been arranged.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_096.wav|75|He refused to name the survivors.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_205.wav|102|We played them off the pitch.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_080.wav|24|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_179.wav|19|He's got a great chance of making it.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_297.wav|61|Mr Campbell received a phone call.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_332.wav|17|He wins the match with a passionate, committed, almost demented, display.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_183.wav|82|They had seven children.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_051.wav|18|It means it is difficult.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_019.wav|0|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_214.wav|35|We used to live with dignity in our country.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_022.wav|26|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_372.wav|9|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_229.wav|106|There was a fine line to tread.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_202.wav|17|I wanted, really, to deal with two opposite energies.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_061.wav|100|What do we do ?
DUMMY2/p307/p307_122.wav|22|One, the Acute Services Trust, will run the general hospital services.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_246.wav|50|His is a global perspective.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_115.wav|3|She is not a victim.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_357.wav|54|Now we need to keep our heads up.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_012.wav|87|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_057.wav|80|Already, he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_273.wav|22|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_248.wav|62|I was proud of our lads.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_065.wav|53|Indeed he has a lot of output.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_415.wav|89|Mentally, you have to be tough.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_175.wav|62|They want this research to continue.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_200.wav|64|Now it has been eclipsed.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_173.wav|79|Can he do it?
DUMMY2/p282/p282_200.wav|83|Who will pay for this?
DUMMY2/p345/p345_327.wav|82|Her body was found on Monday morning.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_243.wav|106|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_023.wav|106|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_080.wav|20|I first met him last summer.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_110.wav|70|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_056.wav|89|They were on holiday in Egypt.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_256.wav|51|It needs to be sorted out by Easter.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_353.wav|74|Our Great Depression is our lives.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_167.wav|99|We have a budget in March.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_471.wav|65|Each year they cut them down a bit.)
DUMMY2/p271/p271_180.wav|27|One season, they might do well.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_308.wav|13|But let's not get carried away.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_244.wav|101|What was the matter for concern ?
DUMMY2/p281/p281_114.wav|36|His is a success story by any standard.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_342.wav|94|Is there a new way forward?
DUMMY2/p329/p329_386.wav|103|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_226.wav|46|Our job is to change that.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_146.wav|20|That group reported just before Christmas.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_062.wav|19|They said they were only young men.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_336.wav|93|We agreed to disagree.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_293.wav|58|It was not a difficult decision, he said.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_079.wav|24|We had a court hearing in London yesterday.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_202.wav|104|It will determine whether an offence has occurred.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_022.wav|81|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_023.wav|68|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_070.wav|83|But I've won both ways.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_032.wav|57|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_327.wav|28|Part of Johnny was found some days after.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_148.wav|47|This latter point is hugely important.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_066.wav|76|He got his degree.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_303.wav|99|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_147.wav|30|I could feel the blood on my face.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_411.wav|27|Quality Meat Scotland was vigorous in its defence of the labelling.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_299.wav|73|We are a peaceful people.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_088.wav|85|I feel confident about the outcome.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_124.wav|96|That's all right then.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_105.wav|78|I had no intention of misleading anyone.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_166.wav|54|The home team also had their moments.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_139.wav|6|Changes need to be made.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_347.wav|27|I got a yellow card.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_402.wav|85|It was a great team effort.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_382.wav|63|It is not for any other purpose.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_138.wav|102|We were with him the whole time.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_254.wav|68|I learned a lot from her.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_179.wav|98|We've got a mixture of both.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_404.wav|13|What is the Barnett formula?
DUMMY2/p272/p272_176.wav|69|Tony had arrived.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_154.wav|105|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_319.wav|0|I would do away with the dress code.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_066.wav|71|"There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music."
DUMMY2/p307/p307_388.wav|22|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_357.wav|100|Her life is now back on track.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_320.wav|44|I am proud of those guys.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_416.wav|79|This was a very tragic accident.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_458.wav|37|I have worked as a stand-up there often.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_392.wav|39|We have to put pressure on Rangers.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_122.wav|0|My conscience is not clear.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_357.wav|42|With him are the symbols of his faith.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_217.wav|13|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_265.wav|11|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_156.wav|2|That includes the equipment?
DUMMY2/p314/p314_022.wav|51|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_234.wav|102|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_028.wav|79|These decisions are not simple.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_181.wav|56|Are you going to win ?
DUMMY2/p292/p292_126.wav|13|We are under no illusions about this.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_406.wav|64|After New Labour, we now have New Unionists.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_221.wav|27|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_115.wav|28|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_112.wav|67|He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_030.wav|6|His party never arrived.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_150.wav|105|He will emerge as a world leader.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_279.wav|58|It has, however, been a long time coming.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_106.wav|106|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_248.wav|46|What's it got to do with them, anyway?
DUMMY2/p362/p362_282.wav|15|I want my country to be a republic, not an empire.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_392.wav|60|It is a natural reaction.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_328.wav|28|We are the weakest link.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_097.wav|105|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_336.wav|58|The package has been properly costed.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_272.wav|24|I should think so, too.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_353.wav|35|Even the one she loved.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_099.wav|45|Two of the team became ill.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_106.wav|37|Talk of a crisis is absurd.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_258.wav|81|There's not much money in cycling.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_270.wav|102|The main thing is that they enjoy it.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_094.wav|96|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_193.wav|91|He scored one goal and was on fire.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_109.wav|100|And does it ?
DUMMY2/p274/p274_450.wav|32|We just thought it would be kept under the carpet.)
DUMMY2/p241/p241_032.wav|86|This is the window.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_159.wav|1|I'm really looking forward to it.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_119.wav|11|The quality of work is very impressive.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_255.wav|90|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_379.wav|52|He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_127.wav|94|Next season for every manager is a long time away.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_137.wav|13|I still think he will win.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_107.wav|85|It will have to ratify the deal.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_333.wav|91|They've been at it for five hours.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_379.wav|6|But is he?
DUMMY2/p258/p258_355.wav|26|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_081.wav|64|They wanted to show what they could do.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_302.wav|32|So the Government will be damaged.)
DUMMY2/p282/p282_317.wav|83|Our message was inclusive.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_023.wav|18|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_238.wav|56|We were well worth the win.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_164.wav|86|We have a budget in March.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_244.wav|39|I always felt that I was in control of the match.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_247.wav|39|I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_025.wav|73|Is this accurate?
DUMMY2/p249/p249_179.wav|80|Someone who cares
DUMMY2/p312/p312_341.wav|62|This time we may not be seeking volunteers.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_208.wav|98|So, where do we go from here?
DUMMY2/p227/p227_208.wav|29|However, it is not as simple as this.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_004.wav|34|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_171.wav|77|Says the Duke of York.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_324.wav|2|It's not long enough.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_065.wav|13|It's really good, as long as we play well.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_254.wav|0|It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_062.wav|94|Scotland had great assets.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_039.wav|38|I think it can count against you now.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_089.wav|25|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_131.wav|38|It was just an accident of birth.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_054.wav|2|That's the truth.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_125.wav|79|And if they fail?
DUMMY2/p259/p259_064.wav|7|It wasn't possible to relax.)
DUMMY2/p376/p376_068.wav|71|"It should be devolved."
DUMMY2/p230/p230_156.wav|35|You have to ask whether they have really thought through these issues.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_002.wav|30|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_080.wav|79|But who is it?
DUMMY2/p363/p363_019.wav|6|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_085.wav|55|LET there be light.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_212.wav|74|We have to put pressure on Rangers.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_138.wav|99|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_201.wav|63|We represent a wide range of society.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_282.wav|42|Mr Forrester reacted angrily.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_299.wav|3|We were well worth the win.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_009.wav|43|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_169.wav|4|O, Is there a lot of blood?
DUMMY2/p278/p278_321.wav|10|I first met him last summer.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_265.wav|38|It felt like my support system was leaving.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_330.wav|105|He says that he is no different from any other man.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_006.wav|11|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_191.wav|65|We tried four banks.)
DUMMY2/p317/p317_419.wav|97|Neither side can win this war.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_036.wav|66|That was no surprise to me.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_070.wav|107|But it was to no avail.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_034.wav|79|I am really ready for it now.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_363.wav|105|There were no casualties.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_178.wav|22|The big issue for us is the review.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_276.wav|84|It is the same in Sweden.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_294.wav|5|It was good.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_145.wav|90|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_190.wav|30|There was great support all round the route.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_412.wav|54|Such people do not exist.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_326.wav|78|The suggestion is the market is not instantly attracted.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_195.wav|50|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_156.wav|80|The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_328.wav|98|And it's difficult to argue.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_424.wav|65|Our performance wasn't perfect.)
DUMMY2/p334/p334_182.wav|38|Lord Johnston will give a decision later.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_282.wav|1|Except, this time, it seems, he really, really means it.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_336.wav|15|I am sure all schools would accept that.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_278.wav|74|We have worked well with them for years.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_149.wav|102|I feel my life to be at risk.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_066.wav|56|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_263.wav|78|The performance continues to improve.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_114.wav|18|We're not that bad.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_298.wav|60|He did it well.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_024.wav|16|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.It's nice to hear.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_261.wav|42|She was charged with perjury.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_176.wav|47|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_303.wav|4|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_126.wav|83|I'm so angry.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_445.wav|106|We accept the new rules.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_147.wav|8|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_349.wav|43|He's been the key to everything.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_045.wav|29|He was a home referee.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_382.wav|15|Both will be heard at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_362.wav|21|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_168.wav|90|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_400.wav|62|Do what you have to do.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_379.wav|10|This decision is a farce.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_075.wav|13|If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_380.wav|56|We will win the argument.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_014.wav|51|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_111.wav|4|There could be no dispute about our history.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_155.wav|63|The striker needed attention before he could resume.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_239.wav|103|It will be even more difficult tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_162.wav|53|That will reduce my chance of selection.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_239.wav|57|He claimed the government had lost the plot.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_291.wav|3|In many ways, that is as important.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_096.wav|30|Craig is still suffering seizures.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_445.wav|7|Such an attack is bizarre.)
DUMMY2/p233/p233_330.wav|84|The commitment was not long, and it was worth the risk.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_108.wav|94|It was quite rigorous.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_105.wav|47|We do not expect any surplus.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_047.wav|52|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
DUMMY2/p266/p266_293.wav|20|It could well be military.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_371.wav|55|He said legal action could be considered.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_302.wav|34|I first met him last summer.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_040.wav|17|Nothing is lost, everything is recycled.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_137.wav|31|I saw some terrible things.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_079.wav|29|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_196.wav|66|It also highlighted some local hero districts.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_340.wav|43|You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_269.wav|76|The conference is the first test.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_044.wav|48|It carried a double message.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_327.wav|22|Nowadays, it is workers united.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_332.wav|67|I'd like to take the plunge.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_258.wav|74|Thankfully it was cleared up.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_147.wav|100|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_169.wav|70|We have a budget in March.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_208.wav|81|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_135.wav|78|Football is a passion for many.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_326.wav|66|The palace said the Queen was deeply saddened.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_291.wav|47|Sunday's game was not a trial.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_237.wav|99|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_086.wav|59|It is a lifeline.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_016.wav|1|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_055.wav|51|It was developed in the Gulf War.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_197.wav|72|But who knows?
DUMMY2/p292/p292_014.wav|13|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_136.wav|12|All our thoughts and prayers are with them.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_216.wav|74|Everything happened so quickly.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_200.wav|90|I have a cold.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_071.wav|81|He was at home with his pals.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_119.wav|95|It's been a long wait.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_201.wav|17|That was the personal impulse.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_225.wav|66|Here are some possible solutions.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_153.wav|65|Their moment had come, or so they said.)
DUMMY2/p282/p282_220.wav|83|Clearly, the stakes are high.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_162.wav|83|Was this element always there?
DUMMY2/p340/p340_148.wav|74|They are working very well.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_160.wav|26|We try to keep it right.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_281.wav|22|This will secure the future of our industry.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_381.wav|103|Have you heard anything from Paramount?
DUMMY2/p306/p306_356.wav|12|No person was charged.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_020.wav|93|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_041.wav|19|But he is not using them.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_051.wav|66|We are going for it.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_235.wav|102|Everyone could see it apart from Kevin Keegan.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_154.wav|53|Three senior officials were dismissed last week.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_139.wav|19|Sub Not Used, McCulloch.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_255.wav|21|However, my position remains the same.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_332.wav|21|That should give me a chance.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_223.wav|61|The FBI could become involved.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_201.wav|69|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_099.wav|21|It may well have been.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_214.wav|32|Basically, they have to come up with the offer.)
DUMMY2/p330/p330_099.wav|1|There's nothing for the kids.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_266.wav|34|I was not happy about being left out.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_378.wav|93|It's been hard.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_356.wav|9|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_135.wav|104|It seemed to have direction.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_150.wav|44|It was fit for royalty.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_290.wav|81|Painful, but only because it's true.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_337.wav|38|With actors it is slightly different.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_199.wav|4|She was not hard done by.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_002.wav|90|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_249.wav|35|Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_233.wav|4|I came here this week to work.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_301.wav|12|He was then replaced by Ross.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_102.wav|26|She has been shot.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_124.wav|98|The whole thing was just unreal.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_205.wav|10|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_146.wav|9|It is like a football team.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_167.wav|92|These awards will deliver improvements on the ground.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_170.wav|76|There is a simmering anger out there.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_096.wav|89|They lived for their children.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_307.wav|37|Friday night was a pretty good night.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_366.wav|106|The business has expanded rapidly, however.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_061.wav|60|I can't believe she is dead.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_006.wav|50|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_059.wav|98|They enjoy playing the game.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_230.wav|96|I am immensely sad.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_150.wav|90|They have not been named.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_286.wav|41|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_124.wav|5|Twaddle is a case in point.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_164.wav|23|Darrell was, however, adamant.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_150.wav|32|The point is raised again that evening at the Assembly Rooms.)
DUMMY2/p293/p293_186.wav|23|Mrs Taylor is taking legal advice.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_201.wav|32|That might mean another delay.)
DUMMY2/p255/p255_140.wav|31|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_073.wav|37|And then there's the racial hassle.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_160.wav|32|The strong performance is expected to continue.)
DUMMY2/p293/p293_376.wav|23|It is not a road of life.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_347.wav|60|One was a lawyer.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_113.wav|103|It has been hijacked.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_184.wav|99|They receive a high profile in the media.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_378.wav|107|They've got three-quarters of the way.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_242.wav|35|It is possible to be too good.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_171.wav|104|We have a genuine budget in place.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_188.wav|22|I hope you miss the cut.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_046.wav|4|My heart is with the artist.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_381.wav|1|However, the second goal was about to be delivered.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_311.wav|97|He was lying face down in the water.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_312.wav|5|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_115.wav|95|We made a world record together.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_269.wav|42|The criteria have changed.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_333.wav|27|They should take their mobile phones.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_049.wav|63|We are certainly talking about many millions.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_285.wav|82|He's a joy to follow.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_356.wav|22|We are now setting about finding them.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_333.wav|74|It seemed so personal.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_009.wav|58|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_423.wav|11|That time has passed.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_332.wav|13|He became the focus of surrounding interest.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_320.wav|101|We have a good healthy debate.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_155.wav|81|He was asked to quit.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_305.wav|79|We are right at the heart of Europe.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_250.wav|106|I COULD tell that Alastair Wilkie was energised.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_238.wav|5|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_268.wav|74|Aberdeen were difficult to break down.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_226.wav|21|They were understanding and thoroughly deserved their win.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_231.wav|47|It is set in Paris.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_203.wav|3|We can take the city.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_307.wav|32|They have shown a great desire and attitude.)
DUMMY2/p307/p307_139.wav|22|I'm very puzzled by it.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_355.wav|69|He could make it.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_386.wav|78|An announcement is expected this week.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_004.wav|87|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_232.wav|3|It is the strength of the school.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_064.wav|79|But the law is very clear on this.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_184.wav|105|My main concern is that public health is not put at risk.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_406.wav|47|I reminded myself that we were not talking about a death.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_023.wav|0|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_229.wav|94|I have spoken to the skipper.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_300.wav|2|It could work.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_185.wav|53|I made my mind up before we came on tour.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_355.wav|40|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_017.wav|20|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_072.wav|107|I'm thinking, what would be easier?
DUMMY2/p292/p292_066.wav|13|We would certainly consider the proposals.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_346.wav|101|It wasn't a flight of fancy.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_185.wav|62|He will continue to provide support for them.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_379.wav|8|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
DUMMY2/p254/p254_079.wav|41|It came as a surprise because my job is to go backwards.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_400.wav|56|The results will take second place.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_318.wav|20|You may have a short memory.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_042.wav|0|He is too weak to move.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_359.wav|24|Is our children learning ?
DUMMY2/p243/p243_031.wav|53|Things fall a little flat elsewhere, however.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_110.wav|53|Some young girls also came by last night.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_172.wav|51|This is good news for the Western Isles.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_072.wav|61|The end result is precisely the same.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_041.wav|37|She became a heroine of my childhood.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_023.wav|40|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_275.wav|20|It was very fast.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_225.wav|19|This was not an easy meeting for me.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_040.wav|76|They hit me in the head.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_319.wav|23|Frankly, they have to crack down.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_032.wav|70|Help is needed.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_211.wav|81|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_183.wav|75|I feel like my game has come a long way.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_323.wav|61|It should be equal.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_251.wav|6|I don't feel like working.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_074.wav|60|That took two weeks.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_283.wav|82|The only problem was, they were on himself.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_275.wav|17|Top-up fees are not on the agenda.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_163.wav|72|It was nice to get a clean sheet.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_108.wav|16|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_103.wav|68|He went to see what he could learn.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_200.wav|63|I'm interested in interesting work.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_063.wav|38|Tomorrow night is the important game.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_017.wav|26|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_312.wav|84|We have got no money to go anywhere.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_063.wav|68|That is a mark of what you are.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_364.wav|54|It's a source of deep concern.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_261.wav|2|Souter will be back.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_114.wav|0|Why do it otherwise ?
DUMMY2/p247/p247_190.wav|14|The Royal Highland was no exception.)
DUMMY2/p271/p271_179.wav|27|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_047.wav|61|It is urgent.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_374.wav|77|They should take their mobile phones.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_063.wav|95|He also presented You Bet!
DUMMY2/p339/p339_302.wav|18|That is exactly right.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_363.wav|43|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_278.wav|99|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_368.wav|86|He put some colour into Scottish history.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_030.wav|59|They should be so lucky.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_182.wav|32|Did he trip ?)
DUMMY2/p336/p336_024.wav|98|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_170.wav|36|It's nice to be nice.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_055.wav|106|This represents a tough game for us.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_166.wav|37|YOU cannot blame the turnout.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_196.wav|88|I put the drawing down.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_318.wav|16|The show is at an end.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_158.wav|37|But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_294.wav|20|No Briton has ever won.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_237.wav|52|He has worked for several years in the United States.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_367.wav|7|Nobody said it was required.)
DUMMY2/p258/p258_069.wav|26|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_365.wav|70|By that time, however, it was already too late.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_098.wav|45|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_226.wav|51|That is not an easy thing.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_129.wav|70|It's not a U-turn.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_121.wav|16|We enjoyed it today.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_314.wav|43|I did not name it.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_241.wav|93|Of further privacy, he had no need.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_015.wav|27|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_064.wav|87|Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_168.wav|11|That prevented any recurrence of the problem.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_444.wav|75|I know the worry over Iraq.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_195.wav|22|Harold is a rarity.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_066.wav|9|He was popular.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_119.wav|99|Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_379.wav|41|Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_290.wav|76|Painful, but only because it's true.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_111.wav|52|Former Hamilton defender Colin Miller could return to the club today as manager.
