DUMMY2/p364/p364_101.wav|88|It is still holding good today.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_350.wav|65|I would be very keen on a move to Italy.)
DUMMY2/p286/p286_224.wav|63|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_231.wav|75|The course has helped a lot.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_422.wav|97|Appointments should be made on merit.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_184.wav|71|"The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday."
DUMMY2/p253/p253_080.wav|70|Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_403.wav|100|How do you take them away ?
DUMMY2/p234/p234_181.wav|3|He was asked to quit.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_167.wav|22|Shyness has rarely sold in boxing terms.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_110.wav|33|This is wrong, but it's what is believed.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_189.wav|57|Mr Marshall is expected to join the council of Europe.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_278.wav|76|Something was plainly wrong.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_042.wav|59|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_306.wav|15|I don't think that is good enough.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_130.wav|49|This is the high point of my career.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_342.wav|84|I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_117.wav|31|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_263.wav|26|Today we can say that a new era has begun.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_368.wav|0|They were to blame for the first two goals.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_132.wav|17|Britain may now be forced to listen.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_284.wav|90|The Government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_163.wav|65|There is no doubt there's room for us.)
DUMMY2/p287/p287_012.wav|77|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_391.wav|91|I had no qualms about it.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_253.wav|70|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_011.wav|60|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_228.wav|46|The damage has been done.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_409.wav|98|I just carry on with my work.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_259.wav|56|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_300.wav|6|How do you feel?
DUMMY2/p286/p286_152.wav|63|What do we want to do that for ?
DUMMY2/p226/p226_243.wav|43|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_280.wav|65|Sales will begin by the end of October.)
DUMMY2/p345/p345_237.wav|82|Rangers are my life.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_017.wav|17|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_275.wav|103|From a marketing standpoint, you can understand their concern.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_151.wav|48|Which isn't a bad idea.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_302.wav|13|As to rugby, well, no-one knows.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_336.wav|26|They haven't got a hope.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_380.wav|91|It was a job he loved.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_114.wav|2|In the current outbreak, the reverse is true.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_211.wav|3|The trading conditions are not good.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_144.wav|11|I see the extended family once a year.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_125.wav|48|They lived for their children.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_370.wav|26|I am a star.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_335.wav|95|I was there five months ago.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_355.wav|68|The boy is no longer with us.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_036.wav|22|Jacques Chirac, the French president, was surely in his sights.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_136.wav|101|But the Commission is on a collision course with the Government.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_106.wav|7|We haven't finished the complaints procedure.)
DUMMY2/p363/p363_266.wav|6|Two other men have recovered.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_274.wav|90|She has every confidence in his performance of his duties.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_297.wav|1|That was quite an interesting part.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_141.wav|64|The post will run for four years.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_203.wav|60|She would say he was still the best.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_007.wav|80|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_256.wav|47|I was happily surprised.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_212.wav|62|But my daughter has got nothing.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_200.wav|36|This market has been neglected by the whisky industry.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_102.wav|79|I welcome the decision.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_362.wav|100|At first, the youngster was not keen.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_043.wav|38|The offer of help is there for anyone.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_433.wav|39|Which may be the same thing.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_408.wav|33|If it's not, they didn't go far enough.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_295.wav|74|It shows the right amount of progress.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_220.wav|36|Does the name matter ?
DUMMY2/p316/p316_331.wav|85|But that is not an issue for now.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_101.wav|61|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_170.wav|52|That is a big risk at any price.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_243.wav|54|He added, It's not a racial problem.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_071.wav|70|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
DUMMY2/p363/p363_380.wav|6|We were very unhappy with the incident.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_340.wav|55|If we get the wrong candidate.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_189.wav|5|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_019.wav|41|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_345.wav|39|Tourists are only concerned with the quality of their experience.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_307.wav|30|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_028.wav|105|Because we do not need it.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_176.wav|102|It is very difficult to find a buyer.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_189.wav|82|We've seen that time and time again.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_390.wav|10|The team hadn't been picked.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_089.wav|56|It was a family tragedy.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_147.wav|25|I am just trying to do my job.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_175.wav|52|It didn't come as any great surprise.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_156.wav|89|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_069.wav|20|Then followed a bout of flu.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_180.wav|75|What do they want us to do ?
DUMMY2/p244/p244_397.wav|78|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_422.wav|89|Eriksson would have approved.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_057.wav|43|It's the big omission.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_188.wav|29|We've just had it confirmed.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_247.wav|51|The death toll included five children.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_317.wav|74|They want that school.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_286.wav|74|I have spoken to my brother.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_243.wav|39|The body follows the mind.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_113.wav|102|Look at them after three days of rain.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_194.wav|90|The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_371.wav|39|Nobody else was with me.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_063.wav|69|It is unique.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_085.wav|13|I am delighted for everyone in Airdrie.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_099.wav|4|It's like an extension of your body.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_454.wav|7|It is not an inquiry to clear the athletes.)
DUMMY2/p250/p250_157.wav|24|Why change it ?
DUMMY2/p236/p236_250.wav|75|That wasn't an outstanding performance from Celtic.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_463.wav|14|The Edinburgh audience was able to understand the dialogue.)
DUMMY2/p287/p287_157.wav|77|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_223.wav|67|I am delighted for Simon.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_213.wav|88|I am happy to be here.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_123.wav|67|I'm delighted about that.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_343.wav|37|Scottish consumer protection groups were generally receptive to the proposals.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_026.wav|21|I'll go to the races.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_181.wav|94|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_104.wav|7|They will remember this victory for a while.)
DUMMY2/p374/p374_369.wav|11|And we know that, because we know the hairdresser.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_068.wav|81|We should have known.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_440.wav|36|THE boy in The Sixth Sense is not alone.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_299.wav|29|She failed in her action.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_304.wav|75|He will address the nation this evening.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_111.wav|83|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_013.wav|67|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_322.wav|36|The letters are going out today.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_314.wav|102|It is just completely erased.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_112.wav|81|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_409.wav|38|The Master was by then just too old.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_333.wav|0|It makes a compelling display.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_329.wav|52|I thought the race was a little bit slow.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_345.wav|95|Like many companies, it is a problem.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_364.wav|56|They have broken that promise.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_273.wav|89|He looked very sharp.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_182.wav|97|Three penalties were given.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_149.wav|4|It's been such a waste of money.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_198.wav|80|We are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_219.wav|94|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_342.wav|22|He's a joy to follow.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_323.wav|78|But it is up again.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_236.wav|70|The minister is the engineer.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_357.wav|10|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_305.wav|85|It is believed that he had been stabbed.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_203.wav|92|It's like an extension of your body.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_154.wav|18|The hearing is expected to continue today.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_055.wav|24|The teacher would have approved.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_102.wav|87|You should try to have a laugh.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_431.wav|75|It was that bad, that low.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_266.wav|13|Have we not been here before?
DUMMY2/p234/p234_165.wav|3|Anyone can do the sums.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_233.wav|2|Wealth is relative.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_499.wav|75|In fact, we were all over the shop.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_125.wav|69|Who would have?
DUMMY2/p237/p237_153.wav|61|He will emerge as a world leader.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_079.wav|69|I had my suspicions.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_182.wav|71|"Miller was every bit as happy."
DUMMY2/p230/p230_237.wav|35|Must have been at the bar.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_370.wav|60|The package is a changing one.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_363.wav|92|You're not going to get hurt.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_151.wav|42|Clearly, the IRA has got away with murder.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_185.wav|10|It appears that it was just a genuine mistake.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_222.wav|64|You'll get on like a house on fire.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_016.wav|55|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_103.wav|39|I saw the whole thing.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_273.wav|10|Do I think about them often ?
DUMMY2/p226/p226_270.wav|43|We showed a lot of skill in the final quarter.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_329.wav|12|Three bystanders were killed.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_116.wav|62|I am not against a further inquiry.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_090.wav|7|Why do it otherwise ?)
DUMMY2/p258/p258_201.wav|26|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_355.wav|28|He's on the wrong side.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_013.wav|18|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_099.wav|58|It was a bit of a struggle today.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_451.wav|65|These days are past.)
DUMMY2/p305/p305_292.wav|54|Most of the public are behind me.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_232.wav|49|It sounds a bit of an own goal.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_081.wav|31|We have other options.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_051.wav|20|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_040.wav|5|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_180.wav|86|They know no other way.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_116.wav|64|Henry was strong and talented.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_025.wav|58|I just went for it over the weekend.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_368.wav|65|We've had some pretty bad times.)
DUMMY2/p245/p245_165.wav|59|What has caused the demise of singing?
DUMMY2/p374/p374_215.wav|11|I'm really proud of my young players.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_081.wav|12|His options are severely limited.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_290.wav|64|I have heard the stories from Scotland.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_138.wav|9|Is that it?
DUMMY2/p294/p294_175.wav|104|Family members are at her bedside.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_284.wav|47|It's like a high school play.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_425.wav|24|It is understood the timescale for the refurbishment has slipped.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_339.wav|99|It's the last thing on my mind.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_260.wav|31|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_232.wav|42|She added, The sheriff was obviously frustrated.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_386.wav|18|So far the weather has been very pleasant.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_391.wav|98|It left me with a sadness.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_173.wav|87|Is it in the right place ?
DUMMY2/p276/p276_282.wav|106|Sunday's game against Celtic is huge.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_263.wav|62|His arrival could be the making of them.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_247.wav|68|We're into that build-up now.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_263.wav|13|They loved it and it showed.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_272.wav|95|Is it in the right place ?
DUMMY2/p340/p340_013.wav|74|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_297.wav|78|How independent is that ?
DUMMY2/p336/p336_395.wav|98|He is a one-off.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_304.wav|85|I didn't feel good.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_159.wav|57|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_216.wav|34|Lack of pace is his big problem.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_074.wav|26|It is a matter of the utmost concern to the Allies.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_305.wav|88|I chose the former.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_284.wav|17|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_270.wav|92|Whether this return was too soon.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_242.wav|74|I'm still an amateur in that sense.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_113.wav|70|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_111.wav|75|The result is a vacuum.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_254.wav|10|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_127.wav|83|She really suffered for her art.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_059.wav|82|They were willing us to get a second.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_073.wav|91|Hopefully we can use this as a platform.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_187.wav|81|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_252.wav|76|The man became a reporter.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_260.wav|85|It was bound to happen, and it has happened.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_346.wav|16|This is a big advantage.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_339.wav|16|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_097.wav|45|It is a good day for the coalition.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_026.wav|27|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_394.wav|33|I am so, so, so lucky.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_139.wav|38|This is the New Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_058.wav|74|Why does it work?
DUMMY2/p258/p258_024.wav|26|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_463.wav|75|Not if you know the person.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_056.wav|40|We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_313.wav|50|I thought he did very well.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_201.wav|30|It was a lot of hard work, but it wasn't difficult.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_369.wav|55|Results of the survey are expected by the end of June.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_190.wav|15|We will win this tie.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_253.wav|68|Both will be heard at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_086.wav|36|The error appeared in a warrant.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_083.wav|8|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_057.wav|47|The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_193.wav|54|He needed seven hours of surgery.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_060.wav|7|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.)
DUMMY2/p267/p267_038.wav|0|This represents a tough game for us.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_158.wav|67|The home side didn't stand a chance.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_078.wav|10|It's so hard to shift.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_205.wav|73|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_178.wav|47|Mr Marshall is expected to join the council of Europe.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_245.wav|73|That could be in place by next year.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_027.wav|67|It's nice to hear.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_024.wav|8|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_275.wav|27|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_115.wav|7|New Year will be very busy.)
DUMMY2/p312/p312_168.wav|62|What's it for, after all?
DUMMY2/p283/p283_058.wav|95|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
DUMMY2/p347/p347_245.wav|46|Do not go into government buildings.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_017.wav|87|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_061.wav|23|This was dismissed as absolute nonsense.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_011.wav|12|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_171.wav|88|You will never replace the child.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_248.wav|96|A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_034.wav|65|We are opening an inquiry.)
DUMMY2/p271/p271_364.wav|27|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_042.wav|67|He did not know his daughter.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_200.wav|68|But, because of the wood, no-one had the experience.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_078.wav|32|I first met him last summer.)
DUMMY2/p238/p238_132.wav|37|Diversions were put in place.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_034.wav|20|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_320.wav|56|He will go a long way.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_165.wav|39|However, she did not report the matter to the police.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_102.wav|65|I feel confident about the outcome.)
DUMMY2/p303/p303_349.wav|44|I don't think the Saudis will lay down.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_205.wav|105|He is slightly confused.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_496.wav|75|They never gave up hope.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_359.wav|64|They were that poor.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_061.wav|80|Jobs could go.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_412.wav|6|It was not even this century.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_208.wav|26|He is slightly confused.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_294.wav|74|We are not collecting.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_357.wav|91|They were the best team, but unlucky in the end.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_012.wav|20|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_125.wav|63|The situation is not easy, but we will prevail.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_101.wav|69|It was clear.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_097.wav|91|He was married with a young child.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_003.wav|98|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_224.wav|4|But it's just great to have won.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_356.wav|85|It is time for concerted national action.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_155.wav|99|They were later discharged from hospital.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_031.wav|79|I decided it is going to be William.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_418.wav|37|We have no information on Iraq.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_295.wav|84|Like his acting, it was an accident.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_354.wav|92|Nine days later, he suffered another attack.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_354.wav|31|It benefits the whole family.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_092.wav|75|The vast bulk of its funds are run by Aberdeen.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_081.wav|50|On Saturday, it was much the same.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_237.wav|84|Broke the birdie record.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_109.wav|20|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_126.wav|89|There were no grounds for his action.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_366.wav|2|It seems a long time ago.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_089.wav|66|He will be sentenced tomorrow by Lord Dawson.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_088.wav|104|It's not very pretty, but it's effective.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_211.wav|84|A deadline is still essential.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_215.wav|30|Is this accurate?
DUMMY2/p247/p247_250.wav|14|I have never heard a rule that you could be too young.)
DUMMY2/p307/p307_083.wav|22|Cars are great for going long distances.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_233.wav|59|It would appear that it has not been a problem.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_317.wav|49|Dialogue is the key.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_307.wav|3|However, he lasted only five days before going on the run.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_289.wav|34|Certainly, there is much on the agenda.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_108.wav|105|They had to be cut from the wreckage.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_086.wav|101|In fact, he should never have been in the field.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_114.wav|87|Well, he is an artist.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_385.wav|7|I've always been a sensitive.)
DUMMY2/p316/p316_011.wav|85|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_110.wav|58|That, he claimed, was essential.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_208.wav|28|We're still hopeful of concluding the deal.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_295.wav|65|She doesn't know the half of it.)
DUMMY2/p333/p333_411.wav|64|It may mean more money, but we don't need the money.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_281.wav|45|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_097.wav|87|And does it ?
DUMMY2/p293/p293_166.wav|23|It is physical but it is also good.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_335.wav|66|He said he needed no more evidence.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_390.wav|0|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_249.wav|96|Jock Brown is appointed as general manager.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_383.wav|35|He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_204.wav|30|Have we not had the rainy season already?
DUMMY2/p351/p351_099.wav|33|They were unable to revive him.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_044.wav|4|I am content with the silver.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_068.wav|79|We are not going to back off.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_277.wav|55|If I didn't go for the world record, I'd feel guilty.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_294.wav|68|The Devil is the creator of weapons.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_297.wav|23|It was just another race, and yesterday is history.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_139.wav|53|The programme has been made with great care.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_242.wav|52|What do we want to do that for ?
DUMMY2/p294/p294_237.wav|104|He was overwhelmed by the response.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_175.wav|107|It is time to come into the limelight.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_006.wav|43|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_292.wav|106|However, he urged the trade to keep the faith.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_123.wav|36|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_392.wav|85|It will benefit a lot of people.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_206.wav|64|Before the games it was pretty open.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_274.wav|20|That goes back a long way.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_370.wav|68|Now that was a boxing movie.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_309.wav|21|A compromise is essential.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_270.wav|29|Did he trip ?
DUMMY2/p299/p299_063.wav|58|It was, for me, like a week in heaven.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_135.wav|35|I would relish the prospect.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_324.wav|6|He was in a mood.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_224.wav|43|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_254.wav|13|His game was complete.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_006.wav|89|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_195.wav|40|Yet the data is compelling.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_303.wav|32|The partnership was set up during the summer.)
DUMMY2/p264/p264_107.wav|65|I was born for this moment.)
DUMMY2/p302/p302_157.wav|30|Smaller parties have reason to be pleased.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_059.wav|70|My fitness was very poor.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_473.wav|100|War is not the action.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_046.wav|36|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_213.wav|81|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_119.wav|88|I will be trying to do better tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_286.wav|2|We are not going to forget.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_212.wav|72|Just don't go looking to be shocked.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_004.wav|91|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_139.wav|13|However, this idea is never developed.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_327.wav|61|The parents will have a great time, too.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_325.wav|73|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_144.wav|42|It's my nature.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_016.wav|43|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_336.wav|20|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_136.wav|37|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_020.wav|79|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_365.wav|106|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_096.wav|43|However, it did not end that way.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_138.wav|40|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_372.wav|11|I am delighted for everyone in Airdrie.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_433.wav|36|It is an absolute nonsense.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_334.wav|44|Hopefully, the whole of Scottish rugby was paying attention.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_301.wav|65|The direct effects on trade will be limited.)
DUMMY2/p251/p251_361.wav|9|I saw some good things.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_238.wav|87|Does that put pressure on us ?
DUMMY2/p228/p228_170.wav|57|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_075.wav|74|Would she remember the music?
DUMMY2/p277/p277_281.wav|89|This is a national crisis.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_165.wav|16|Again, we were lucky.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_154.wav|26|They are expected to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court today.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_144.wav|41|Three penalties were given.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_335.wav|58|He also was in debt to drug dealers.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_237.wav|9|But he failed to win the committee's support.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_360.wav|89|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_047.wav|104|This was no accident.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_176.wav|4|those who are preparing to give up.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_409.wav|69|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_113.wav|49|Few other services in Scotland are affected, the spokesman said.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_283.wav|87|But no party would win overall control of Scotland.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_010.wav|77|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_162.wav|9|We have to move forward.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_217.wav|39|The early goal was a shock to the system for Hearts.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_030.wav|50|That deal is a joke.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_060.wav|37|Well, he is an artist.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_053.wav|52|He said he still planned to go ahead with deep tax cuts.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_297.wav|47|The home was now under new management.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_017.wav|29|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_417.wav|37|This would discourage investment and job creation.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_141.wav|90|We want to keep the pound.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_134.wav|13|I did not understand the dynamics of Scotland.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_400.wav|104|Of course, it doesn't all come off.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_160.wav|106|That was the first time I worked with Richard.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_201.wav|4|I want the Commonwealth and European titles.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_309.wav|96|We are now looking at the degrees of injury.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_193.wav|16|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_391.wav|60|Sometimes we find a person.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_089.wav|23|A hard act to follow, but it is being followed.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_258.wav|8|I'm not making any specific attempt on the world record.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_235.wav|75|Basically, they have to come up with the offer.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_022.wav|82|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_159.wav|88|Mr Blair defended his wife.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_175.wav|37|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_413.wav|97|The parents will have a great time, too.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_220.wav|41|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_042.wav|48|Have I really come to this ?
DUMMY2/p361/p361_162.wav|79|This means a lot of hard decisions.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_427.wav|39|But we are severely limited in funds.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_087.wav|34|Who does he think will win?
DUMMY2/p374/p374_051.wav|11|We have a problem.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_417.wav|74|It is a good result.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_251.wav|78|I wouldn't even respond to that question.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_086.wav|48|Or so the theory goes.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_172.wav|29|One season, they might do well.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_391.wav|25|The orchestra was already increasing the scope of its ambitions.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_210.wav|71|"The FBI could become involved."
DUMMY2/p276/p276_355.wav|106|Employees may be taken on at Livingston.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_414.wav|14|After the match, do you ?)
DUMMY2/p245/p245_124.wav|59|He was in a great deal of pain.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_137.wav|41|It plans to return to this field.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_166.wav|89|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_152.wav|6|The progress has been steady.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_334.wav|70|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_250.wav|8|The irony was not lost.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_056.wav|33|We're all involved in deciding where it goes.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_150.wav|88|Do not listen to them.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_399.wav|29|How do you take them away ?
DUMMY2/p244/p244_223.wav|78|Because he was born in England.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_119.wav|79|Cost is a factor, but not the only one.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_148.wav|8|No-one from the Fire Brigades Union was available for comment yesterday.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_158.wav|102|Sussex Police refused to give any further details.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_075.wav|58|It does not stop at the border.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_163.wav|98|Everything has its place and purpose.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_174.wav|39|They are expected to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court today.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_154.wav|76|The salary changes are long overdue.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_305.wav|82|I didn't know she could do that.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_236.wav|62|It will take place in July.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_180.wav|42|We are committed to urgent action.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_438.wav|63|Which may be the same thing.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_056.wav|2|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_383.wav|0|They have not done so this season so far.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_246.wav|64|We were hopeful that it would be successful.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_312.wav|47|He was solid.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_298.wav|100|A senior party insider said.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_061.wav|88|No-one knows the numbers.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_177.wav|0|I have spoken to head office.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_405.wav|15|I'd never heard anything like it before.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_097.wav|58|He is a man who lives to work.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_291.wav|97|They refused to fire on their own countrymen.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_367.wav|97|That meant the search was unlawful.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_140.wav|41|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_077.wav|56|They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_283.wav|75|She always wanted her own way.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_185.wav|93|We want to help them through it.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_353.wav|4|Tyson said he had made a mistake.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_164.wav|50|He was in great spirits.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_151.wav|105|It opens the door to the Champions League.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_385.wav|17|However, there you have it, success has eluded them so far.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_360.wav|50|I've always been a sensitive.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_222.wav|0|You have to do your research.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_041.wav|71|"It is urgent."
DUMMY2/p298/p298_069.wav|68|Manager Neil Cooper revealed yesterday.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_337.wav|47|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_115.wav|69|I am just trying to do my job.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_039.wav|97|The study, carried out by the consumer magazine Which?
DUMMY2/p326/p326_041.wav|28|It would be a miracle.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_321.wav|22|The observer saw no evidence of fighting.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_057.wav|92|We recorded it at our own expense.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_233.wav|107|There is a tunnel after the tunnel.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_125.wav|7|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.)
DUMMY2/p286/p286_357.wav|63|Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_336.wav|50|I think it's about time.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_208.wav|41|I began to pray.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_437.wav|14|We've made a couple of albums.)
DUMMY2/p351/p351_259.wav|33|It was like being in prison.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_256.wav|82|You've got to fight to stay up.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_153.wav|23|Who would be out there, singing?
DUMMY2/p233/p233_199.wav|84|However, this idea is never developed.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_188.wav|49|We just want to get stuck in now.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_106.wav|55|And so it went on.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_045.wav|49|The prognosis is excellent.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_348.wav|75|The confidence isn't there now.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_280.wav|85|So, how did this happen?
DUMMY2/p283/p283_445.wav|95|THE boy in The Sixth Sense is not alone.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_186.wav|60|I certainly do not agree with that.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_051.wav|63|He also presented You Bet!
DUMMY2/p253/p253_214.wav|70|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_131.wav|54|On this form, they have a real chance of going up.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_188.wav|58|It worked, up to a point.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_099.wav|64|Life is about people, and how you feel about people.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_352.wav|86|The pressure is on Celtic in the main.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_083.wav|21|That was the easy election.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_175.wav|48|Mr Blair should be warned.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_410.wav|54|He has never even been to Ireland.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_399.wav|48|Both sides have to step back.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_083.wav|71|"They lived for their children."
DUMMY2/p264/p264_014.wav|65|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. )
DUMMY2/p334/p334_012.wav|38|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_416.wav|97|This was not the show for me.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_229.wav|96|What was the main difference ?
DUMMY2/p249/p249_203.wav|80|I wanted to put myself on the line.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_233.wav|1|I never made any offer to Mark.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_306.wav|90|Funding for the science centre has come from a number of sources.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_411.wav|11|It's very tragic and traumatic.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_232.wav|93|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_164.wav|97|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_022.wav|93|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_067.wav|99|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_402.wav|37|Venus rejects the very suggestion.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_080.wav|17|They seem to be backing off from that.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_360.wav|6|We're going to sleep.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_094.wav|78|It is not a story.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_423.wav|107|In fact, they should have scored three times.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_277.wav|80|He has a wealth of experience.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_326.wav|65|The change could come as soon as September.)
DUMMY2/p233/p233_260.wav|84|I was happily surprised.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_251.wav|76|Which, in effect, it is.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_346.wav|8|And does it ?
DUMMY2/p361/p361_181.wav|79|That's not the way to think.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_273.wav|19|There is no more money.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_288.wav|25|It's like a high school play.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_361.wav|33|Further details are expected later.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_014.wav|91|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_255.wav|48|Allen is strong in every shape and form.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_327.wav|92|The decision was left entirely to him.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_368.wav|7|It was tough to contain the excitement.)
DUMMY2/p231/p231_238.wav|50|The minister is the engineer.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_240.wav|9|However, no further action was taken by police.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_419.wav|32|The second goal was superb.)
DUMMY2/p314/p314_026.wav|51|He was born in London of Scottish parents.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_262.wav|30|It's not one for the purists.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_380.wav|95|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_104.wav|61|We want to get to the final, anyway.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_047.wav|35|I must take a seat.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_229.wav|83|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_343.wav|47|He's been the key to everything.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_344.wav|47|The boat was fantastic.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_363.wav|26|That would help.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_050.wav|68|I saw them not long after it happened.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_293.wav|12|As agreed, the prime minister was driven to Westminister Hall.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_011.wav|33|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_215.wav|103|The court has not decided.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_429.wav|56|A police spokeswoman said last night that the case was closed.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_222.wav|69|However, no further action was taken by police.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_110.wav|87|Instead, another depression came in.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_276.wav|61|It is also very valuable.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_173.wav|75|They could not match it.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_199.wav|44|The pressure is on President Bush to deliver.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_025.wav|105|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_105.wav|90|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_288.wav|47|Who did the recruiting?
DUMMY2/p232/p232_179.wav|96|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_268.wav|66|We don't have the credible evidence.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_182.wav|33|That's the way things are heading.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_431.wav|63|It's going to be epic.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_152.wav|97|T, Is there anything in the wound?
DUMMY2/p259/p259_241.wav|7|Anyway, the job will be part-time.)
DUMMY2/p286/p286_369.wav|63|Do not forget about Monaco.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_334.wav|34|It was not known to myself.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_272.wav|89|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_225.wav|58|Our biggest threat is the BBC.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_198.wav|12|Both of them have looked good.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_305.wav|93|There was no hint of scandal.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_229.wav|52|I want to see as much progress as possible.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_138.wav|60|That's the way they are.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_113.wav|78|He is not a dancer.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_212.wav|16|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_164.wav|76|Agents and coaches must be paid.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_224.wav|44|I was living with my mum.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_155.wav|96|This latter point is hugely important.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_320.wav|104|Johnson was pretty low.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_411.wav|51|He is very popular in the squad, in England, and abroad.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_134.wav|103|Is that too much to ask?
DUMMY2/p260/p260_192.wav|81|I have a cold.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_398.wav|91|What other retailer would do this?
DUMMY2/p230/p230_215.wav|35|The most exciting room is the final one of the show.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_068.wav|69|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_330.wav|22|It will also take evidence from consumers.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_314.wav|50|I'm not making any comment at all.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_337.wav|91|His English counterpart agreed.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_311.wav|17|That's what it's all about, isn't it?
DUMMY2/p270/p270_192.wav|8|You know the sort of thing.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_317.wav|91|I look for dancers who are also actors.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_184.wav|86|We did everything by the book.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_380.wav|63|It's as wide as a church in here.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_268.wav|102|Once they go away they won't come back.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_225.wav|101|It is good for our team.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_101.wav|59|That team is due to be announced this morning.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_407.wav|95|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_110.wav|67|I'm not depressed.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_093.wav|1|This will be great for the young lads.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_094.wav|50|You are like an animal.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_110.wav|24|They must be on commission.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_131.wav|26|It plans to return to this field.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_271.wav|81|They seem to get away with it.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_368.wav|58|Horses have some sense.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_422.wav|46|It may mean more money, but we don't need the money.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_498.wav|75|I was ready for this.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_363.wav|10|His views are hardly surprising.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_357.wav|43|I kept going for her.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_016.wav|91|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_253.wav|5|they fail to engage.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_422.wav|27|I've invented a village in East Lothian.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_089.wav|86|They have not done so this season so far.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_082.wav|88|No-one has spoken to me.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_122.wav|81|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_265.wav|28|But there are some problems.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_229.wav|40|He is in the queue.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_420.wav|34|The commission is not the only loser.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_142.wav|30|It will be the final push.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_139.wav|55|It should have its own network.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_139.wav|100|Several messages can be taken from the occasion.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_011.wav|53|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_193.wav|41|The conference is the first test.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_219.wav|91|What are you not good at?
DUMMY2/p233/p233_310.wav|84|This is the culture change in medicine.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_184.wav|41|However, this idea is never developed.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_274.wav|60|Neither had the public.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_328.wav|5|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_303.wav|79|Is it worth it?
DUMMY2/p297/p297_289.wav|42|I couldn't put my finger on it.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_095.wav|92|I had some time with Aston Villa.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_117.wav|19|They will be destroyed.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_057.wav|55|We wish to win, but not at any price.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_155.wav|68|Except, this time, it seems, he really, really means it.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_053.wav|81|My fitness was very poor.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_355.wav|51|The home was now under new management.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_060.wav|85|However, our players will fight for that.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_006.wav|107|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_203.wav|72|They will want to perform well.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_343.wav|73|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_178.wav|93|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_036.wav|13|PR will be just one of them.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_115.wav|83|It was the eighties.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_330.wav|14|The party lasted all night.)
DUMMY2/p232/p232_410.wav|96|I was in a position to challenge for this event and didn't.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_384.wav|40|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_095.wav|89|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_067.wav|38|Every school in Scotland should be excellent.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_058.wav|22|The encounter was to change his life.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_082.wav|13|I was in prison for a year.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_154.wav|4|We have the easy part.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_348.wav|92|This process of attrition is expected to continue.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_288.wav|7|It is probably in the culture.)
DUMMY2/p233/p233_114.wav|84|It was the eighties.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_453.wav|36|We're all paying for it.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_283.wav|106|I've come here for the jersey.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_217.wav|70|Then another one came.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_307.wav|9|This is a national crisis.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_351.wav|14|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.)
DUMMY2/p341/p341_026.wav|66|That's interesting to me.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_278.wav|56|They failed to reach agreement yesterday.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_110.wav|89|You should be.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_383.wav|25|Stewart will travel with some confidence.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_283.wav|69|Who did the recruiting?
DUMMY2/p278/p278_301.wav|10|So the Government will be damaged.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_275.wav|33|This is not a message from ministers.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_071.wav|37|Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_246.wav|81|There will be widespread support on all sides.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_287.wav|87|What form did that take ?
DUMMY2/p297/p297_389.wav|42|I hope the voters will respond.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_281.wav|34|We all like to see forgiveness and redemption.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_150.wav|71|"The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough."
DUMMY2/p286/p286_048.wav|63|Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_117.wav|1|The government was consulting interested parties, he added.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_115.wav|32|However, the problem is the timing.)
DUMMY2/p261/p261_287.wav|100|It has the potential to be another North Sea.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_179.wav|77|They all made the European Ryder Cup team.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_073.wav|8|She declined to give the reasons for the decision.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_311.wav|70|You may have a short memory.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_196.wav|48|Two years of building a business will go up in smoke.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_214.wav|57|We will give a formal response to the report in due course.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_001.wav|6|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_410.wav|87|It tells the story of a woman who has probably been abused.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_247.wav|26|It's a record label, not a form of music.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_283.wav|96|I am an estate agent.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_035.wav|6|I think it is wide open.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_388.wav|84|I was in jail for five years.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_413.wav|89|went on sale.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_321.wav|105|Three years ago he would have been.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_015.wav|3|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_352.wav|74|She is also claiming constructive and unfair dismissal.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_151.wav|45|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_380.wav|104|Visitors were also impressed.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_174.wav|43|It's quite a routine.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_069.wav|87|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_223.wav|31|The FBI could become involved.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_132.wav|31|It is also well received.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_171.wav|86|A helpline number is published at the end of this article.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_316.wav|0|He has left the company.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_104.wav|94|No date has been set for the appeal.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_251.wav|24|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_384.wav|87|Labour will almost certainly remain in control.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_333.wav|21|Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_050.wav|86|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_024.wav|82|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_213.wav|58|Scottish public finances emerge from this review enhanced.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_045.wav|37|This represents a tough game for us.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_341.wav|65|This deal is a great boost for the Borders.)
DUMMY2/p306/p306_221.wav|12|A world away from Rangers, you might say.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_340.wav|31|Look at the witnesses.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_286.wav|18|I made a mistake.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_316.wav|11|He had been a singer.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_134.wav|66|However, in Scotland this figure was four weeks.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_068.wav|15|How is he enjoying life as a senior?
DUMMY2/p297/p297_417.wav|42|This is his personal life.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_374.wav|40|You can cope with it.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_357.wav|23|We're very excited and challenged by the project.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_092.wav|33|Four had been brought down.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_039.wav|82|A killer is also on the loose.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_176.wav|89|Tony had arrived.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_056.wav|18|There are two things we have to do.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_356.wav|18|Could it be?
DUMMY2/p276/p276_096.wav|106|The coach is a man who is very ambitious.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_235.wav|104|We're talking about one or two years.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_241.wav|104|I couldn't have asked for better.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_201.wav|19|I'm just looking to take my chances.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_324.wav|35|We were on our way.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_083.wav|27|He is driven.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_293.wav|32|And Michael was just great.)
DUMMY2/p228/p228_247.wav|57|He's a lovely young man.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_362.wav|85|If he does not leave, he will be shot.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_073.wav|2|What has changed?
DUMMY2/p330/p330_359.wav|1|Our people should be immune.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_144.wav|16|Note the date.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_052.wav|32|The latter were not from Scotland.)
DUMMY2/p234/p234_246.wav|3|Is it in the right place ?
DUMMY2/p326/p326_350.wav|28|I'm really looking forward to it.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_223.wav|11|I wonder what they listen to?
DUMMY2/p334/p334_136.wav|38|By that time, however, it was already too late.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_362.wav|69|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_176.wav|9|It is not either national standards or local control.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_036.wav|56|This will save interest charges.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_382.wav|103|He was dead on arrival at the hospital.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_237.wav|86|We have spent the last couple of years with acting directors.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_149.wav|73|I've put my own money into this project.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_408.wav|8|Of course, it is nonsense.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_091.wav|78|However, he stressed that no decision had yet been made.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_157.wav|82|No, you couldn't make it up.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_085.wav|60|He became enchanted with the process.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_342.wav|73|There was a substantial explosion.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_215.wav|7|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.)
DUMMY2/p336/p336_247.wav|98|He has to pull back from the brink.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_179.wav|12|I came home by ambulance.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_382.wav|107|The move follows a review of the Singapore
DUMMY2/p284/p284_294.wav|16|The goals will come.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_233.wav|8|I wouldn't even respond to that question.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_133.wav|91|Both were later released after a check-up.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_258.wav|65|The group's increasing scale will help.)
DUMMY2/p333/p333_190.wav|64|The weekly average was three hours.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_238.wav|35|She died in middle age.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_226.wav|27|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_016.wav|12|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_158.wav|107|A hospital spokeswoman described his condition as stable.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_375.wav|36|There was a thing in front of the camera.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_326.wav|59|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_363.wav|57|I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_354.wav|57|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_130.wav|33|I might come back.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_200.wav|41|We will give a formal response to the report in due course.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_257.wav|76|Nor is it likely to do so.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_313.wav|34|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_045.wav|31|She looked so young.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_367.wav|65|It has helped focus attention on junior golf.)
DUMMY2/p233/p233_274.wav|84|He is a young man with a new deal.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_294.wav|65|If so, we want to hear from them.)
DUMMY2/p227/p227_328.wav|29|The party lasted all night.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_013.wav|16|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_128.wav|74|There may be some resistance.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_355.wav|50|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_174.wav|73|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_097.wav|6|She is still very poorly.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_326.wav|13|My whole life has changed.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_144.wav|91|This was not just incongruous.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_197.wav|53|What was the matter for concern ?
DUMMY2/p271/p271_365.wav|27|Their time has gone.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_129.wav|11|You're not going to get hurt.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_044.wav|75|But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_250.wav|78|Sadly, it could not be done.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_236.wav|6|I think it's more important to have fun.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_050.wav|1|There will be widespread support on all sides.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_215.wav|42|This club have been fair to me.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_145.wav|42|He was shocked by what he saw.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_338.wav|57|This is a friendly match ?
DUMMY2/p362/p362_155.wav|15|I asked to take it up to Glasgow.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_210.wav|35|We have an election in eight days.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_097.wav|53|Put simply, it goes something like this.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_269.wav|52|They always want to give a performance.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_137.wav|44|Otherwise it could have secured a cinema release.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_314.wav|35|I can hardly believe it.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_154.wav|23|It is very simple, no-one is forced to compete.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_030.wav|21|People don't feel safe, including me.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_202.wav|85|Nobody is pushing out to the right.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_050.wav|54|But don't expect an easy ride.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_242.wav|53|What do we want to do that for ?
DUMMY2/p304/p304_160.wav|72|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_273.wav|99|It's a way of life.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_162.wav|32|We came across the first set of bodies.)
DUMMY2/p257/p257_264.wav|105|We're in shock.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_201.wav|2|Today was first class.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_211.wav|52|This is a young squad and we're all supporters.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_378.wav|6|I have no evidence.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_117.wav|34|It's like, If he's all right, we will go with him.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_065.wav|33|His handling raises a wider issue.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_194.wav|2|It's a fact.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_010.wav|100|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_061.wav|17|There are just two tournaments remaining.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_187.wav|6|The prime minister will make the decision.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_254.wav|9|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_109.wav|17|Sergio was talking his chances down yesterday.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_417.wav|79|We are very, very confident.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_085.wav|88|He dismissed the action.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_358.wav|48|The wedding date has been set for Orlando in Florida in October.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_041.wav|72|However, they will only be found in the wild.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_405.wav|33|But is he?
DUMMY2/p249/p249_071.wav|80|It is like a river running by my home.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_027.wav|93|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_001.wav|74|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_256.wav|100|We want to play at the worlds.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_024.wav|45|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_077.wav|22|Their one weakness was running between the wickets.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_048.wav|21|He is trying really hard.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_174.wav|14|The strong pound also took its toll.)
DUMMY2/p347/p347_261.wav|46|It had been in place since last July.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_407.wav|15|Hopefully, it will be good enough.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_203.wav|103|I am aware that somebody made a threat.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_260.wav|32|Labour was too busy to respond.)
DUMMY2/p308/p308_179.wav|107|I will have to order its destruction.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_260.wav|5|There's not much money in cycling.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_107.wav|6|I am the head.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_120.wav|5|She really suffered for her art.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_042.wav|54|He also admitted possessing a firearm.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_293.wav|31|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_114.wav|15|He had returned to die.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_265.wav|52|His condition was described as serious last night.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_396.wav|89|The car was just there.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_145.wav|8|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_245.wav|66|What makes a house a home?
DUMMY2/p298/p298_007.wav|68|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_220.wav|27|That idea is rubbish.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_156.wav|87|The following are the principal provisions.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_208.wav|32|Which isn't a bad idea.)
DUMMY2/p273/p273_408.wav|56|There was an element of frustration.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_209.wav|85|It is not a financial issue.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_325.wav|21|Our thoughts are with her.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_125.wav|73|Is that it?
DUMMY2/p316/p316_206.wav|85|All of us in Scotland should be viligant.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_113.wav|48|We have thought about doing lots of things.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_156.wav|37|Hopefully, no-one will suffer too badly.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_154.wav|102|Does that put pressure on us?
DUMMY2/p376/p376_253.wav|71|"That is highly unfair."
DUMMY2/p231/p231_156.wav|50|It is a terrible tragedy.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_010.wav|52|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_006.wav|71|"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. "
DUMMY2/p284/p284_016.wav|16|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_183.wav|65|We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.)
DUMMY2/p329/p329_298.wav|103|This is not a faceless system.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_054.wav|17|They were not defeated.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_370.wav|35|We are really good friends.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_446.wav|100|It's hard to make these decisions at my age.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_248.wav|41|I was shocked.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_347.wav|12|The Israeli government is destroying the peace process.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_005.wav|68|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_407.wav|106|Its failure is no surprise.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_143.wav|10|Others are not so sure.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_044.wav|47|Hopefully, it will be built by next year.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_118.wav|80|They were behind the wheel.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_330.wav|92|That's always the case, isn't it?
DUMMY2/p330/p330_333.wav|1|There was pressure from elsewhere too.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_380.wav|76|They were outstanding and thoroughly deserved their win.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_086.wav|83|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_283.wav|20|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_172.wav|59|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_106.wav|52|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_208.wav|100|I think, therefore I am ?
DUMMY2/p361/p361_409.wav|79|Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_414.wav|26|Also, it is the season of goodwill.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_217.wav|12|I told you, you were doing it all wrong.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_206.wav|54|Surely, if anything, it would be the other way round.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_197.wav|37|His words were not audible.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_194.wav|83|Peace was won.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_206.wav|106|Sloppy answers are to be avoided.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_143.wav|79|They received no money under the merger.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_329.wav|65|We are a husband and wife team.)
DUMMY2/p248/p248_350.wav|99|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_322.wav|80|That's the law of the land.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_106.wav|105|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_091.wav|79|Where are they?
DUMMY2/p326/p326_188.wav|28|I want to be there by right.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_198.wav|14|It caused a lot of upset.)
DUMMY2/p335/p335_386.wav|49|Muslim leaders in Italy have denied the charge.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_287.wav|104|This could take a few days.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_133.wav|18|It happened again yesterday.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_042.wav|44|His charisma is all on the course.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_262.wav|84|It is also very valuable.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_114.wav|45|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_192.wav|65|Is there a waiting list?)
DUMMY2/p362/p362_106.wav|15|So is that it, then?
DUMMY2/p293/p293_041.wav|23|I would just like someone to confess.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_062.wav|68|Don't say you have not been warned.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_012.wav|36|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_435.wav|50|I never won a penny throughout my career.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_362.wav|56|But BA said the prediction was premature.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_084.wav|92|Mr Wilson has received no such request.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_057.wav|87|But it couldn't happen overnight.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_148.wav|15|It was that kind of match.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_358.wav|22|We must not go down that road.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_265.wav|1|It was tough, but we did have a lot of possession.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_311.wav|98|That is when we are really effective.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_246.wav|18|Now, that would impress the kids.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_281.wav|36|The demand is created by the supply.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_098.wav|30|That certainly brought me back down to earth.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_213.wav|50|We have an election in eight days.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_043.wav|37|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_408.wav|98|As if he would.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_287.wav|0|was everything done to save people ?
DUMMY2/p278/p278_095.wav|10|That time is not now, however.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_347.wav|66|This is entirely appropriate and overdue.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_380.wav|24|There is no deal as yet.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_264.wav|29|The baby deserves the credit.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_197.wav|6|I wanted to get on with it.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_413.wav|46|We are going through difficult times.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_244.wav|7|People should make their own decisions.)
DUMMY2/p238/p238_257.wav|37|It was a terrible combination of factors.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_080.wav|44|I was unconscious for two or three seconds.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_213.wav|92|He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_377.wav|24|Those people must be accountable.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_250.wav|59|It is nearly there.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_002.wav|66|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_349.wav|100|The Premier League has been a huge success.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_170.wav|75|That is not the case.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_136.wav|4|Parole isn't a decision for me.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_224.wav|64|It could not be too high.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_414.wav|27|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_280.wav|92|Look at the Liberal Democrats.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_138.wav|97|The captaincy will help that, too.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_323.wav|80|There was no time scale.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_028.wav|32|This is a central issue.)
DUMMY2/p229/p229_294.wav|67|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_320.wav|74|The last few weeks have been really bad.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_320.wav|47|Kids are terrible.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_056.wav|90|Sadly, it can't.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_050.wav|32|The outcome of their game isn't the important thing.)
DUMMY2/p279/p279_142.wav|25|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_397.wav|26|These guys are looking for business.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_166.wav|101|Like last month, it is simply too early to make a call.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_303.wav|67|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_387.wav|10|This remains the party's policy.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_214.wav|55|I want a free vote.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_100.wav|2|We have an election in eight days.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_248.wav|15|In saying that, you just have to get on with it.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_033.wav|30|I've taken to the hills.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_204.wav|3|Are you going to win ?
DUMMY2/p347/p347_182.wav|46|Moving from Manchester to London was upheaval enough.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_401.wav|54|In some cases, the nation should be grateful.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_368.wav|67|I am a star.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_145.wav|85|All will be revealed in due course.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_027.wav|12|This is not an amnesty.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_457.wav|106|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_380.wav|52|This is an audience determined to enjoy themselves.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_366.wav|83|It was a funny game.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_290.wav|103|We had no part in it.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_033.wav|0|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_248.wav|106|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_052.wav|19|What were they?
DUMMY2/p278/p278_225.wav|10|I'm just a regular person.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_073.wav|98|Any error is severely punished.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_143.wav|0|It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_065.wav|85|The problem is not confined to the UK.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_112.wav|61|Who would be right ?
DUMMY2/p241/p241_053.wav|86|However the drama was still not at an end.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_368.wav|102|Stewart will travel with some confidence.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_224.wav|62|We want to sort it out.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_351.wav|1|There was no sign that anything was amiss.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_060.wav|4|His third goal was superb.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_228.wav|82|But he is not hopeful.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_220.wav|2|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_036.wav|98|I want to make a vigorous defence.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_077.wav|79|I wouldn't give them a grade.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_324.wav|17|However, in October another partnership was announced.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_073.wav|88|A contractor was due to be appointed yesterday.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_240.wav|45|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_372.wav|13|The Cup has come home.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_108.wav|43|That time is not now, however.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_259.wav|45|This is a big club.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_243.wav|63|I have spoken to the skipper.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_061.wav|13|A killer is also on the loose.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_008.wav|99|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_131.wav|94|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_279.wav|77|Internet users will double over the next three years in the UK.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_029.wav|80|Because we do not need it.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_291.wav|56|Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_399.wav|11|I was influenced by all of these things.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_260.wav|35|In fact, we were all over the shop.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_104.wav|32|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.)
DUMMY2/p302/p302_069.wav|30|I hope we can put it behind us.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_074.wav|68|We are now in a safe place.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_111.wav|102|I'm not a diva.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_092.wav|43|It's just awful.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_043.wav|102|It has been a horrible, horrible time.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_436.wav|48|I also had a lot of injuries, which did not help me.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_238.wav|30|His silence on the issue is interesting.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_361.wav|19|Well, you can have a tree.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_410.wav|1|What does he want him to look like?
DUMMY2/p282/p282_062.wav|83|I expect a rapid response.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_367.wav|92|For us, that decision was hard to understand.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_353.wav|96|Like his acting, it was an accident.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_335.wav|37|He was admitted to hospital.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_032.wav|33|Thirty schools were closed in the Western Isles.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_235.wav|29|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_192.wav|99|All options are open.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_133.wav|2|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_131.wav|46|YOU thought it was a headache.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_131.wav|76|I'd love to be at the World Cup.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_294.wav|48|I saw them last week.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_228.wav|97|Seaman is not the goalkeeper of old.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_334.wav|33|He will go a long way.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_106.wav|57|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_318.wav|68|We have grown up in Britain.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_210.wav|87|The partnership was set up during the summer.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_342.wav|99|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_160.wav|100|We knew we had the goal we wanted.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_314.wav|107|Tonight's matches European Championship.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_053.wav|42|It was located on the remote control.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_093.wav|106|Funding needs to be long term.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_318.wav|99|I saw some good things.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_339.wav|81|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_074.wav|23|We've had our problems at the club.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_155.wav|93|My Dad is a hero.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_214.wav|54|The whole thing is utterly transparent.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_039.wav|107|All of us do.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_297.wav|80|What has altered?
DUMMY2/p345/p345_037.wav|82|I was completely knackered.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_339.wav|102|But their bodies were found at lunchtime yesterday.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_332.wav|43|I am so upset.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_359.wav|31|We are looking for perfection.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_088.wav|73|I saw the whole thing.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_007.wav|5|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_046.wav|32|Pulled a huge number of viewers.)
DUMMY2/p240/p240_149.wav|93|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_047.wav|43|We need to chat.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_321.wav|106|It caused a lot of upset.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_230.wav|84|We played them off the pitch.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_197.wav|27|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_202.wav|53|I've never had a year like this.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_034.wav|57|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_022.wav|11|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_013.wav|22|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_230.wav|23|We had no idea that this letter existed.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_100.wav|85|I kept it very simple.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_075.wav|36|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_274.wav|101|We have not reached the point of no return.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_371.wav|86|Well, the big day has arrived.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_086.wav|93|Someone who cares
DUMMY2/p246/p246_202.wav|5|Feel the heat?
DUMMY2/p270/p270_264.wav|8|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_281.wav|92|Surely it can't get any worse.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_230.wav|75|I had relied on him.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_158.wav|1|His only reply was a laugh.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_028.wav|18|It's a big mystery.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_366.wav|72|We talk about effective military action.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_072.wav|37|I had relied on him.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_238.wav|14|A small number of new jobs will also be created.)
DUMMY2/p284/p284_234.wav|16|The whole thing will be great.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_133.wav|55|Eight others have followed.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_300.wav|88|I really want to win in Glasgow.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_387.wav|106|The statement contained no surprises.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_388.wav|67|It has been a lovely family occasion.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_271.wav|56|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_100.wav|61|They were outside the circle.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_281.wav|85|It's all a part of letting it go.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_363.wav|20|This is a club on the rise.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_306.wav|52|Are you going to win ?
DUMMY2/p275/p275_110.wav|40|It was the eighties.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_410.wav|42|You have friends in the Liberal Democrats.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_368.wav|66|I don't have a new house.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_115.wav|77|Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_162.wav|46|Its effect on humans is not yet known.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_116.wav|86|I'm delighted about that.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_102.wav|66|He put some colour into Scottish history.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_074.wav|45|I've not thought about it.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_383.wav|102|Even then he was in the media spotlight.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_168.wav|94|I am now unemployed.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_133.wav|93|The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_201.wav|72|The same goes for McKenna.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_170.wav|81|As we worked.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_199.wav|28|Everyone knew where they were.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_094.wav|54|Alan Milburn, the health secretary, refused to comment.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_245.wav|104|Some days are different from others.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_154.wav|104|Therein lies the problem.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_298.wav|5|And huge, indeed, it is.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_224.wav|92|Why is he not fighting for the Union?
DUMMY2/p269/p269_331.wav|94|Henman has been warned.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_054.wav|58|I have been here for only three months.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_053.wav|48|I remember that day well.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_376.wav|21|He really has everything, including a beautiful swing.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_333.wav|55|But it won't help British farmers.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_066.wav|73|Is there a new way forward?
DUMMY2/p273/p273_159.wav|56|The jury is still out.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_265.wav|19|By this point the couple were approaching fast.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_047.wav|82|His record with England was not good.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_334.wav|62|However, she is female, and so.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_358.wav|23|The science is well known, the solution is simple.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_147.wav|42|We had a really good experience with David.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_166.wav|25|It is not too late to get on board.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_337.wav|48|Twaddle is a case in point.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_180.wav|11|However, the referee was not in the giving vein.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_341.wav|9|It could have gone either way.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_486.wav|24|He was certainly upbeat about his chances.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_170.wav|15|We've got to get back to normal.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_033.wav|15|The British government said she was coming home.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_422.wav|103|The country is in a state of chaos.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_047.wav|49|That, though, is the measure of the man.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_068.wav|68|Some people still think she should be English.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_176.wav|65|No-one wants to talk about death.)
DUMMY2/p323/p323_328.wav|34|The pair are no strangers to smashing records.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_236.wav|46|It is a cause for concern.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_218.wav|49|It is a court case.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_021.wav|82|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_303.wav|9|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_126.wav|34|I try not to expect anything.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_160.wav|107|Councillor Gordon has refused to stand down.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_169.wav|57|Eight months later, he was dead.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_238.wav|36|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_396.wav|36|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
DUMMY2/p265/p265_252.wav|73|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_431.wav|7|It is not over by any means.)
DUMMY2/p341/p341_094.wav|66|We are losing this war.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_436.wav|37|The only problem was, they were on himself.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_422.wav|38|It's not realistic because it's early days.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_234.wav|35|So far, the problems have occurred in the US.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_343.wav|67|These days are long gone.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_316.wav|10|You have asked for action.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_416.wav|50|There is some light in the tunnel.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_052.wav|58|That was the problem.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_136.wav|88|But he's a very quiet man.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_298.wav|30|It all seemed so easy.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_013.wav|39|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_154.wav|5|She had gone to the Catholic school.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_158.wav|18|The day may come, but not for a while.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_465.wav|24|Let that be their memorial.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_460.wav|48|Further savings would arise from common procurement and IT systems.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_313.wav|55|It was a total surprise.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_033.wav|42|Other forces were, however, at work.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_255.wav|34|Thankfully, for me, the matter is now closed.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_007.wav|20|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_107.wav|63|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_049.wav|54|Here is a tale of devotion to duty.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_128.wav|70|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_394.wav|20|They are good.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_382.wav|58|We believe the squad will stay together.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_141.wav|106|Cutting ticket prices would certainly help.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_149.wav|53|Is it in the right place ?
DUMMY2/p295/p295_206.wav|92|Hospitals and school building will go ahead.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_138.wav|68|It could have been a hammering by now.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_277.wav|42|It does not move, which is amazing.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_241.wav|67|We were a load of rubbish.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_373.wav|14|Neither woman has been named.)
DUMMY2/p360/p360_063.wav|60|But it would say that.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_053.wav|94|We have not given up hope.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_220.wav|29|There is no quick fix.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_164.wav|8|The woman was his wife.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_051.wav|13|Five officers were injured.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_126.wav|27|The people will come.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_218.wav|67|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_263.wav|60|It can take a long time.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_311.wav|91|Both sides have to step back.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_328.wav|14|We believe the world has too many refugees already.)
DUMMY2/p254/p254_105.wav|41|Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_078.wav|51|What did we learn?
DUMMY2/p275/p275_294.wav|40|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_375.wav|40|It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_389.wav|102|It is a temptation which should be resisted.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_296.wav|50|It's all designed to speed up the service.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_155.wav|97|It's all about money, money, money.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_055.wav|60|But here it is also very bad.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_206.wav|26|The aim is to have the reports online by this autumn.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_135.wav|36|We will try to find someone.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_301.wav|56|And that culture is everywhere In Dublin.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_205.wav|104|Our traditions and cultures remain the same.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_382.wav|96|Five members were disciplined.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_237.wav|5|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_414.wav|72|At the end of the day, one has to be careful.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_234.wav|32|It depends on Labour, not on us.)
DUMMY2/p262/p262_260.wav|45|The bottom line is that we had to get a win.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_260.wav|87|We have a budget in March.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_210.wav|10|I won't make an official complaint.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_328.wav|39|They come to enjoy themselves.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_355.wav|97|What's a boy to do?
DUMMY2/p280/p280_174.wav|52|The company hopes to top seven million passengers in its current financial year.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_369.wav|70|Colour was at the core of his life.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_272.wav|84|We showed a lot of skill in the final quarter.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_251.wav|47|I told you I was ill.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_120.wav|102|However, it very nearly all went wrong.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_096.wav|46|They don't take you to mass graves.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_100.wav|39|However, a decision should be made before the end of August.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_344.wav|106|The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_404.wav|26|Then , he laughs.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_217.wav|11|I had nothing to lose.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_019.wav|54|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_176.wav|20|Is Saddam a threat?
DUMMY2/p301/p301_107.wav|91|The little boy was playing football at lunchtime.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_230.wav|98|I wish him well for the future.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_180.wav|20|Almost the day after the election, the battle lines were drawn.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_376.wav|19|She died at her home.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_365.wav|107|Last night was a key episode.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_196.wav|80|I had a train to catch.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_264.wav|81|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_167.wav|50|It is simply not true.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_171.wav|7|It's never great to finish second.)
DUMMY2/p271/p271_034.wav|27|I feel I did not have enough time.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_069.wav|71|"Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_309.wav|33|Then you see it.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_005.wav|76|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_328.wav|7|And that culture is everywhere In Dublin.)
DUMMY2/p306/p306_205.wav|12|We played them off the pitch.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_194.wav|34|You could see he was thinking about it.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_080.wav|94|People must remain vigilant.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_065.wav|82|It would be a last resort.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_235.wav|92|It's about attitudes to change.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_111.wav|103|They agree to meet.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_436.wav|50|There will be no excuses on Wednesday.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_424.wav|48|The capital costs are modest.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_066.wav|97|Donald Dewar was passionate about his politics.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_309.wav|9|Who did the recruiting?
DUMMY2/p254/p254_123.wav|41|We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_397.wav|82|Almost overnight, he found his voice.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_400.wav|103|We have high hopes that this will work.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_228.wav|78|We want this place to work.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_208.wav|31|It's just awful.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_378.wav|67|They play together perfectly.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_291.wav|96|They were also beside themselves.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_175.wav|39|Eight months later, he was dead.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_194.wav|19|That will depend on the outcome of inquiries.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_099.wav|98|That statement has never been withdrawn.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_214.wav|76|We are a party for people, not against people.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_339.wav|77|The election is total confusion and chaos.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_203.wav|45|It's all about money, money, money.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_284.wav|40|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_329.wav|49|In Europe, it is always over two games.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_251.wav|86|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_104.wav|33|I didn't deserve to be sent off.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_176.wav|103|The show is small but perfectly formed.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_404.wav|91|He is very popular in the squad, in England, and abroad.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_174.wav|90|It is not either national standards or local control.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_322.wav|52|We will not simply hit these people.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_108.wav|104|That's not part of the deal.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_348.wav|105|He could face a jail sentence.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_206.wav|34|But they were unable to respond in time, officials have said.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_107.wav|0|There were no grounds for his action.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_142.wav|102|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_312.wav|9|The results are sometimes contentious.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_194.wav|57|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_065.wav|79|I thought it was quite a positive result.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_062.wav|81|It's that kind of place.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_155.wav|34|The encounter was to change his life.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_245.wav|7|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.)
DUMMY2/p269/p269_216.wav|94|I am delighted for Simon.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_308.wav|51|A counter reaction was.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_082.wav|4|Well, that's just a third district.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_060.wav|103|In short, the club was broke.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_212.wav|97|It's a production company.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_058.wav|91|The encounter was to change his life.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_077.wav|72|We are almost at that point, but not quite.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_162.wav|26|I lost my head.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_291.wav|41|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_389.wav|105|Whether the High Court will interfere with the sentence is another matter.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_185.wav|8|It appears that it was just a genuine mistake.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_022.wav|101|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_310.wav|97|However, there could be more bad weather to come.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_208.wav|50|I won't make an official complaint.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_383.wav|23|The penalty was the turning point.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_245.wav|30|Mr Miller is married with three children.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_333.wav|72|We must recognise that this outfit is unique.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_396.wav|18|It is a technique.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_359.wav|40|This is a club on the rise.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_212.wav|95|We are not making any comment.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_126.wav|90|There were no grounds for his action.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_025.wav|79|Something has to be done.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_054.wav|102|He was shocked by what he saw.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_197.wav|92|If they don't want to read it, they don't have to.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_019.wav|96|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_045.wav|61|It is so sad.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_118.wav|16|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_340.wav|70|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_051.wav|85|It is very unfair, and something should be done.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_144.wav|44|That end is enjoying life, as far as David is concerned.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_090.wav|105|Today I couldn't run on it.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_115.wav|13|I'm just going to do my best.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_458.wav|14|It might be useful to have something in black and white.)
DUMMY2/p335/p335_146.wav|49|Mummy believed in one thing above all.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_309.wav|86|Is there on his hands?
DUMMY2/p284/p284_172.wav|16|It is not either national standards or local control.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_161.wav|46|I never had a childhood.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_053.wav|36|I must take a seat.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_072.wav|100|The talks were announced yesterday by Brian Wilson, the foreign office minister.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_227.wav|68|It's been a long, long journey.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_003.wav|25|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_422.wav|32|This market has been neglected by the whisky industry.)
DUMMY2/p302/p302_079.wav|30|I was in jail for five years.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_192.wav|5|I do not own the vessel in question.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_145.wav|72|You have to think not.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_262.wav|53|There would be a north and south division.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_178.wav|68|You let a lot of people down.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_392.wav|95|You must have a government and a good civil service.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_318.wav|5|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_256.wav|79|They seem to be, anyway.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_167.wav|31|It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_033.wav|88|We're not either of those things.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_065.wav|105|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_108.wav|40|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_205.wav|67|Mr Kennedy is not a candidate for the Scottish Parliament.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_047.wav|80|He is too weak to move.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_349.wav|36|The idea was first mooted a year ago.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_422.wav|39|The Queen Mother is dead.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_104.wav|35|I was just appalled at the way they behaved.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_129.wav|9|It was the same at Twickenham.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_172.wav|90|It is too much for me.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_164.wav|70|I'd love to be like Peter.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_063.wav|50|What do we do ?
DUMMY2/p236/p236_416.wav|75|I never had a childhood.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_159.wav|31|There's a sense of excess in the novel.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_112.wav|41|That all hope is never lost.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_175.wav|20|One season, they might do well.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_300.wav|46|This has a number of benefits.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_343.wav|105|We are delighted at the response from potential employers.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_218.wav|36|You are a great player.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_139.wav|52|The programme has been made with great care.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_088.wav|32|The commission initiated the necessary changes in the financial regulation.)
DUMMY2/p292/p292_347.wav|13|The girls are ready to compete.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_144.wav|4|They failed to reach agreement yesterday.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_276.wav|19|There have been different reports from different people.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_261.wav|68|Things were not easy from the outset.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_245.wav|69|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_304.wav|66|It is a very resilient and deadly bacterium.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_411.wav|46|This is a one-year deal, but who knows?
DUMMY2/p232/p232_001.wav|96|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_160.wav|70|Life becomes a song.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_249.wav|24|A small number of new jobs will also be created.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_275.wav|71|"There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast."
DUMMY2/p347/p347_401.wav|46|Why should we even be asked to share?
DUMMY2/p237/p237_314.wav|61|I was concerned with the way they tried to justify his actions.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_331.wav|49|There's a tremendous amount of adventure.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_032.wav|7|The function of the clerk is to provide advice.)
DUMMY2/p343/p343_243.wav|21|Where are you taking her?
DUMMY2/p339/p339_152.wav|18|It was an amazing time.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_036.wav|2|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_192.wav|52|I am fighting the force of nature.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_168.wav|93|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_305.wav|32|Her body was found on Monday morning.)
DUMMY2/p330/p330_316.wav|1|For athletes in our current climate, their sport is their livelihood.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_217.wav|4|This was a lot of numbers.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_229.wav|69|But it's a subtle process.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_091.wav|96|It is a lifeline.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_354.wav|49|It took more than two years.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_327.wav|79|Every case is completely different.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_242.wav|47|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_251.wav|15|Such adjustments have been the salvation of United.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_207.wav|14|It gave no further details.)
DUMMY2/p311/p311_255.wav|4|The film has also been superbly designed.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_206.wav|104|The first eviction takes place on Sunday.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_322.wav|44|It is too early to speculate.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_358.wav|53|His style was direct and very human.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_248.wav|38|I'll always remember the horrible images.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_347.wav|46|It has made a difference.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_122.wav|98|In that case, the children were not missing.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_337.wav|101|But they have the sound.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_359.wav|7|The output price index in December was unchanged on November.)
DUMMY2/p251/p251_057.wav|9|What was the main difference?
DUMMY2/p376/p376_010.wav|71|"People look, but no one ever finds it. "
DUMMY2/p281/p281_384.wav|36|Our policy is very clear on this issue.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_262.wav|95|They have not been in touch with the club.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_116.wav|18|I feel strongly about it.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_249.wav|14|Others agreed with this view.)
DUMMY2/p265/p265_337.wav|73|The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_088.wav|31|However, it did not end that way.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_277.wav|76|It's an absolute disgrace.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_130.wav|0|That group reported just before Christmas.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_140.wav|34|Well, until recently he didn't think so.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_167.wav|107|But even without either, Glasgow will be outstanding.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_062.wav|38|Perhaps we should do the same.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_320.wav|64|We will just get on with it.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_336.wav|100|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_132.wav|97|I think it is wide open.

DUMMY2/p376/p376_262.wav|71|"Frankly, we should all have such problems."
DUMMY2/p245/p245_245.wav|59|This year I understood.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_055.wav|50|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_308.wav|49|It won't happen overnight, but things will get better.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_366.wav|64|People buy everything with cash.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_235.wav|74|It's hard to say.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_127.wav|91|We didn't enjoy the first game, but today they were excellent.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_284.wav|80|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
DUMMY2/p285/p285_251.wav|2|The concerns are the same.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_090.wav|39|Scottish rugby has been in a state of civil war.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_411.wav|4|They knew they shouldn't have been there.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_242.wav|45|A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_346.wav|11|That was about it.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_248.wav|64|It is a weakness, and not the only one.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_057.wav|102|England and Wales are likely to pull out.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_389.wav|66|Is this new report the answer?
DUMMY2/p234/p234_103.wav|3|Police said the family was helping with the search.

DUMMY2/p226/p226_188.wav|43|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_265.wav|70|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_028.wav|54|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_197.wav|101|Who was she ?
DUMMY2/p236/p236_013.wav|75|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_249.wav|20|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_041.wav|77|This will get their attention.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_259.wav|7|Half of young people had had contact with the police.)
DUMMY2/p293/p293_340.wav|23|I have great sympathy with these people.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_017.wav|102|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_221.wav|18|You cannot do that in a lobby.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_308.wav|55|We have achieved that.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_156.wav|23|It's something he has worked very hard on.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_273.wav|12|The board has rejected her proposals.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_336.wav|81|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_080.wav|103|We will see how he is after treatment.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_260.wav|91|That's the sort of game you want.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_062.wav|1|Many, many people don't know who he is.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_001.wav|38|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_328.wav|43|That's the law of the land.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_113.wav|105|It's a shame.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_405.wav|27|They recorded their debut album in New York.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_207.wav|53|I want an answer from the British Government.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_238.wav|62|This is a major step forward for carers.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_243.wav|57|You can feel at home in China.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_267.wav|8|It is probably in the culture.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_004.wav|99|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_233.wav|75|It had all been arranged.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_025.wav|35|It is on the internet.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_300.wav|19|So what's the shape, and what's the detail?
DUMMY2/p363/p363_283.wav|6|And the other winners are.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_219.wav|13|We're looking for unity in the council.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_223.wav|33|I was happily surprised.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_313.wav|57|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_230.wav|20|There is no excuse.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_184.wav|24|They could not match it.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_242.wav|11|It could now be up to the courts.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_284.wav|68|Alcohol and nicotine are now no-go areas.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_422.wav|65|We have some options there.)
DUMMY2/p317/p317_069.wav|97|How do you resurrect a dying town?
DUMMY2/p361/p361_017.wav|79|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_239.wav|87|Did it work ?
DUMMY2/p249/p249_119.wav|80|It was ugly.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_120.wav|38|He also received a medal of honour.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_061.wav|107|Martin Johnson, the England captain, was back, and commanding.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_415.wav|15|It raises the edge.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_183.wav|74|We are really good friends.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_337.wav|66|It is the logical extension of audio description.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_160.wav|92|We're in England for the time being.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_187.wav|85|It is not about the money, it is about everything.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_432.wav|27|I know the worry over Iraq.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_249.wav|56|We have no information on Iraq.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_323.wav|103|He wins the match with a passionate, committed, almost demented, display.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_268.wav|107|Harrowing is easy, after all.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_091.wav|49|The proposal was rejected.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_142.wav|96|I do not want to have a fight with Mr Hastings.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_151.wav|9|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_074.wav|104|This is the real thing now.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_408.wav|63|I was happy to be recognised by Mike Tyson.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_439.wav|75|I can tell you Labour is fighting to win.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_391.wav|39|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_210.wav|43|It's like a garage.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_082.wav|23|Our nation has been changed by this event.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_028.wav|4|I was totally wrong.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_225.wav|20|We were awful.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_361.wav|83|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_007.wav|56|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_258.wav|25|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_057.wav|76|We might be back next year.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_429.wav|105|It's a miracle.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_139.wav|91|I'm very puzzled by it.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_102.wav|12|Where is the anthrax?
DUMMY2/p249/p249_133.wav|80|She said she could not believe that they had run away.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_042.wav|6|There is a new confidence about the club.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_050.wav|26|That's the day job.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_260.wav|56|He took over our lives.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_441.wav|106|It's an option, but I can't really comment.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_032.wav|8|We have to find a way to put that right.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_259.wav|79|Or is he?
DUMMY2/p276/p276_273.wav|106|What was the matter for concern ?
DUMMY2/p305/p305_062.wav|54|That tells you something about them.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_331.wav|50|To beat the European champion is quite nice.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_203.wav|86|He's not perfect.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_416.wav|22|So now this series has had its day.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_081.wav|6|There is room for me.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_389.wav|107|The trouble is, though, that there is no simple solution.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_129.wav|69|She really suffered for her art.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_378.wav|23|It is three years at present.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_238.wav|40|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_099.wav|85|It's a sensible management decision.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_020.wav|58|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_089.wav|8|They must be on commission.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_185.wav|97|The group would never be the same again.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_326.wav|52|I feel as if I can hole everything now.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_153.wav|51|We like being the underdogs.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_249.wav|81|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_177.wav|73|Does this matter?
DUMMY2/p279/p279_374.wav|25|That's the name of the game, though.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_354.wav|79|It must not happen.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_179.wav|14|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.)
DUMMY2/p362/p362_080.wav|15|I found the course inspiring.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_213.wav|33|At the end of the day, one has to be careful.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_335.wav|24|It was nice to finish in style.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_503.wav|48|The world record is suspicious.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_153.wav|70|The weather forecast isn't good.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_120.wav|70|Who would be a referee?
DUMMY2/p297/p297_275.wav|42|How do you find the youngsters?
DUMMY2/p270/p270_201.wav|8|In France, the reverse is true.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_366.wav|27|It has only been rumours.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_301.wav|77|That is the general feeling.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_413.wav|95|I was Scottish on the basis of my family.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_166.wav|13|We want to replicate that success.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_233.wav|15|However, our players will fight for that.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_288.wav|88|It will not be today, though.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_421.wav|40|I know the worry over Iraq.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_212.wav|102|He was too good for me - too consistent.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_372.wav|94|It's a true story.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_183.wav|46|This area is perfect for children.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_217.wav|83|Then another one came.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_340.wav|34|It is a love affair.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_211.wav|82|Drugs are getting through.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_120.wav|54|He seemed to lose his focus.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_263.wav|5|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_384.wav|32|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.)
DUMMY2/p312/p312_302.wav|62|What makes a house a home?
DUMMY2/p284/p284_083.wav|16|By then, he was walking on water.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_090.wav|36|It was worth a photograph.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_301.wav|106|This championship is different from the other majors.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_364.wav|13|Everything was an effort.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_306.wav|35|Rugby is now just like football.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_233.wav|70|Of course I was tempted.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_360.wav|96|It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_366.wav|40|They have not done so this season so far.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_099.wav|28|The performance, for this listener, didn't come off.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_056.wav|52|They seem too much of a sure thing.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_367.wav|68|And a film maker was born.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_425.wav|14|It was submitted without their knowledge.)
DUMMY2/p228/p228_115.wav|57|The eye was badly closed on Sunday.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_349.wav|74|The improvement today was fantastic.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_247.wav|34|Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_092.wav|18|Quite a lot of people know that, actually.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_196.wav|91|Walk out the door and anything can happen.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_212.wav|23|I'm just gonna hit the shot.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_127.wav|67|It was my own fault and I lost a lot of belief.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_232.wav|59|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_127.wav|68|After that date, the numbers should stabilise or fall.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_127.wav|74|This is not the case.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_319.wav|80|Referees are easy targets.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_081.wav|9|War is not the action.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_203.wav|96|A deadline is still essential.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_349.wav|82|I saw one body.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_176.wav|83|As we worked.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_221.wav|56|That was a problem for me.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_097.wav|31|May not have been at fault?
DUMMY2/p323/p323_066.wav|34|The six others were injured.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_292.wav|56|Tony Blair said as little.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_280.wav|75|It has all been done in secret.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_284.wav|69|Bombing slaughter rejected
DUMMY2/p244/p244_110.wav|78|Then again, we could have.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_382.wav|52|The doctors say that he will be fine for the performance next week.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_233.wav|42|We need a visionary producer.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_278.wav|75|We have the moral high ground.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_122.wav|6|Sadly, it is not to be.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_019.wav|19|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_082.wav|84|However, a ruling will not come before next week.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_198.wav|63|The new owners wanted the club to go in a different direction.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_343.wav|46|Government must recognise the problems of Aberdeen.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_144.wav|5|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_284.wav|96|The record companies have gone through the floor.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_021.wav|4|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_054.wav|5|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_199.wav|34|It was an accounting error.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_161.wav|32|He was in great spirits.)
DUMMY2/p360/p360_043.wav|60|That has now gone.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_135.wav|101|We have seen a copy of the report.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_273.wav|14|Is our children learning ?)
DUMMY2/p314/p314_277.wav|51|There was no let-up for the minnows.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_163.wav|26|It is not too late to get on board.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_277.wav|38|Instead, it is back to the drawing board.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_296.wav|73|The letters are going out today.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_020.wav|53|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_086.wav|71|"This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit."
DUMMY2/p335/p335_290.wav|49|He did not oppose the divorce.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_107.wav|45|It's a shame.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_176.wav|46|In less than two months, the women have achieved a lot.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_337.wav|4|They would have been forgiven for doing so.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_019.wav|34|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_248.wav|87|This is absolutely not true.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_105.wav|19|The quality of work is very impressive.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_361.wav|79|I am very sorry to be here.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_289.wav|3|Are they free ?
DUMMY2/p347/p347_265.wav|46|Well, when did he ever refuse?
DUMMY2/p286/p286_464.wav|63|Failure to react to each one could mean a disaster.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_165.wav|48|This was a unique election.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_310.wav|3|Scotland won by six wickets.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_313.wav|33|Here, the fans have been fantastic.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_086.wav|85|Can you imagine a world without design?
DUMMY2/p293/p293_032.wav|23|We are satisfied with this outcome.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_206.wav|105|Her home is perhaps a couple of miles from the town centre.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_396.wav|47|My house was shaking at the time.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_142.wav|57|He was in a great deal of pain.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_143.wav|35|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_221.wav|79|It is a performance.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_071.wav|99|There was an e-mail.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_132.wav|0|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_399.wav|32|The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.)
DUMMY2/p276/p276_201.wav|106|Again he dismissed a merger with Halifax.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_378.wav|56|to have products for their needs.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_052.wav|54|Some US embassy staff have left the country.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_338.wav|18|This has been coming for weeks and weeks.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_403.wav|8|There's still no-one like him.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_022.wav|3|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_061.wav|62|It was a virus.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_204.wav|94|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_342.wav|43|Three years ago he would have been.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_262.wav|104|I thought he was terrific.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_077.wav|58|How can they say that?
DUMMY2/p249/p249_090.wav|80|When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_195.wav|59|I began to pray.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_359.wav|107|The discussions will surely not last too long.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_212.wav|79|I am a socialist.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_021.wav|39|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_021.wav|12|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_103.wav|17|In fact, that would be a distortion of the truth.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_027.wav|27|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_321.wav|34|My mother was getting on at me.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_278.wav|58|It was a long process, but we got there.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_033.wav|25|He took me on a tour of the wards.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_339.wav|91|He wasn't really doing anything, so he wanted out.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_365.wav|93|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_190.wav|26|I grew up listening to these people.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_310.wav|13|Surrender is not an appealing or realistic prospect.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_032.wav|18|Like his acting, it was an accident.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_192.wav|43|People will ask about us.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_114.wav|16|I did not see any reason to change the captain.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_224.wav|25|A career as a doctor is on hold.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_079.wav|56|That should be the subject matter of a public debate.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_098.wav|64|There was no option.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_197.wav|34|It was a good atmosphere.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_003.wav|9|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_049.wav|93|This represents a tough game for us.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_322.wav|93|The election is total confusion and chaos.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_262.wav|61|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_085.wav|58|Israel has done very little until now.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_140.wav|52|There was only one living room, you see.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_325.wav|43|I am very happy to be here.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_085.wav|15|It is not a road of life.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_412.wav|26|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_146.wav|12|They said to me, Why don't you get into acting, Tommy?
DUMMY2/p306/p306_261.wav|12|If it wasn't so pathetic, it would be funny.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_215.wav|73|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_022.wav|17|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_197.wav|25|It was typical.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_207.wav|80|The service from the other players was super.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_124.wav|105|That's all right then.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_227.wav|91|The team this year is going places.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_182.wav|72|These are terrible offences.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_051.wav|1|This was the classical period of Beethoven.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_089.wav|44|It was his twenty-first birthday on Monday.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_017.wav|66|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_077.wav|98|We couldn't afford it.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_139.wav|83|I don't know the full story.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_328.wav|61|It is a job creation scheme.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_053.wav|28|Labour was too busy to respond.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_305.wav|22|That it is a brand name.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_251.wav|31|It would appear that it has not been a problem.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_222.wav|53|We are still seeking that complete performance.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_136.wav|41|The whole thing of doing the movie was a risk.

DUMMY2/p252/p252_090.wav|55|There is no issue of national security involved here.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_175.wav|86|And I saw the light!
DUMMY2/p243/p243_179.wav|53|Nato has left them with no other option.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_252.wav|89|George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_156.wav|39|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_159.wav|96|We have to move forward.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_306.wav|4|That is the consistent approach of the Government.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_145.wav|11|Why is this?
DUMMY2/p347/p347_181.wav|46|In fact, they should have scored three times.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_154.wav|75|This action reflects a slump in bookings.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_183.wav|41|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_062.wav|5|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_124.wav|57|It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_121.wav|6|That takes a lot of courage.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_016.wav|28|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_090.wav|86|The city council is a major property owner in the area.

DUMMY2/p270/p270_277.wav|8|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_090.wav|25|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_232.wav|20|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_282.wav|8|Any error is severely punished.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_294.wav|30|Is something which we just don't do.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_309.wav|93|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_371.wav|38|January is a bad time of year.

DUMMY2/p270/p270_090.wav|8|He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_101.wav|40|He takes the job.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_115.wav|92|I haven't enjoyed the last couple of years.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_267.wav|105|One knows the feeling.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_338.wav|52|How are you, sir ?
DUMMY2/p284/p284_005.wav|16|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_413.wav|6|That was really tough.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_074.wav|90|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_025.wav|3|We are a service industry.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_343.wav|76|It's no less intriguing, however.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_036.wav|61|They're just different.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_071.wav|54|Nancy is not sure how she feels.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_293.wav|36|You have to expect this type of thing.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_368.wav|54|The Dow Jones is way up.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_201.wav|95|Does the name matter ?
DUMMY2/p243/p243_235.wav|53|You are not allowed to do that.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_148.wav|62|He is in a lot of pain, it's very distressing.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_385.wav|47|He is also keen to win the European order of merit.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_270.wav|76|That's what we're trying to achieve.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_056.wav|55|He was failed by his health authority.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_065.wav|78|That is all in the past.

DUMMY2/p303/p303_176.wav|44|A wide range of restrictions are in place.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_280.wav|17|It's good news and long overdue.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_026.wav|100|Meetings will also remain private.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_319.wav|14|His appeal is instantly understood.)
DUMMY2/p243/p243_141.wav|53|I am not under any new pressure.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_388.wav|10|They will fight for everything.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_332.wav|33|He also called in at another farm.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_432.wav|39|A new leader is unlikely to be chosen before September.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_195.wav|103|It is a scandal.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_387.wav|74|I didn't see it.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_142.wav|36|It opens the door to the Champions League.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_173.wav|37|The festivals will be about having fun.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_073.wav|25|He was popular.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_274.wav|38|You can't go back and change things.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_161.wav|90|A Labour insider said it was far too close to call.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_083.wav|85|Worse still, he might be singing Lady in Red.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_366.wav|46|With Pierre, you can never be sure.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_085.wav|82|I would have been shot dead in bed.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_297.wav|100|He ran into immediate problems with local people and police.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_109.wav|7|We needed financial backing to get it off the ground.)
DUMMY2/p262/p262_328.wav|45|Davis is very supportive, as a director.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_335.wav|55|Did it work ?
DUMMY2/p286/p286_394.wav|63|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
DUMMY2/p330/p330_349.wav|1|We are very very proud of Alain.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_261.wav|100|No production contract is yet in sight.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_001.wav|44|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_121.wav|19|It was a journey into a new life.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_322.wav|96|However, the groups denied the claims.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_084.wav|38|It was extremely cold.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_246.wav|28|I've been thinking about it for a year.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_283.wav|16|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_223.wav|102|She didn't tell us anything new.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_366.wav|20|He could make it.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_180.wav|92|Pity he couldn't produce a winning British team.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_099.wav|32|But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant.)
DUMMY2/p265/p265_234.wav|73|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_038.wav|55|That time may never be broken.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_322.wav|21|It is now being examined.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_133.wav|32|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.)
DUMMY2/p260/p260_076.wav|81|The party is up for it.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_387.wav|45|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_212.wav|80|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_021.wav|19|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_308.wav|32|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.)
DUMMY2/p272/p272_279.wav|69|Maloney is an engaging talent.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_229.wav|42|Don't you think it was a fine performance?
DUMMY2/p277/p277_414.wav|89|But we finished the show.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_358.wav|85|Souter will be back.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_018.wav|94|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_261.wav|16|This is a question of Islam.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_181.wav|19|I hope we do.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_117.wav|15|No person was charged.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_038.wav|2|It was clear.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_068.wav|49|I am delighted to hear this wonderful news.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_144.wav|63|The first half was depressing.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_209.wav|46|However, the great thing is that it doesn't matter.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_040.wav|88|I thought it was the only way out.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_216.wav|65|Henry should go now.)
DUMMY2/p362/p362_348.wav|15|They are a very good team.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_194.wav|77|They might be surprised by the response.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_088.wav|70|They lived for their children.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_360.wav|34|This is a critical time for football.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_017.wav|95|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_001.wav|21|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_132.wav|2|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_308.wav|36|The real issue is personal.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_293.wav|49|Connell was standing there, ordering her to get up.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_160.wav|79|That is the sensible outcome.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_047.wav|14|Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.)
DUMMY2/p239/p239_313.wav|48|Does the name matter ?
DUMMY2/p318/p318_219.wav|19|He's very, very lucky to be alive.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_178.wav|79|I was just aghast.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_310.wav|41|It is out there.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_268.wav|67|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_472.wav|7|Then came the farewell to Europe.)
DUMMY2/p287/p287_082.wav|77|He added that he felt undermined.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_363.wav|2|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_336.wav|5|I'm very lucky.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_190.wav|54|Tax is a matter for national governments.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_202.wav|48|Marconi is struggling against terrible market forces.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_049.wav|89|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_026.wav|77|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_015.wav|6|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_351.wav|77|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_193.wav|82|This is a very high price.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_089.wav|52|I feel I did not have enough time.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_163.wav|32|Overall, the labour market continued to tighten.)
DUMMY2/p339/p339_290.wav|18|And yet, there has been no great impact.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_071.wav|30|There is no sign of anyone being hurt.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_186.wav|3|Tony Blair has had a good conference.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_352.wav|68|My preference is for the single vaccines.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_220.wav|104|We are not a retailer, we provide a service.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_060.wav|30|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_311.wav|26|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_078.wav|74|Mr Masterton said he was very hopeful.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_096.wav|65|What do we want to do that for?)
DUMMY2/p277/p277_257.wav|89|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_142.wav|17|It was an ambush.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_103.wav|12|Housing is in very short supply.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_366.wav|66|Both parties can win, and Scotland can win as a result.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_057.wav|64|Alright, it was a defeat, but it felt like a victory.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_311.wav|9|For the moment, our position remains the same.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_344.wav|69|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_343.wav|59|It was forced to divert.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_095.wav|17|I feel very strongly about that.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_003.wav|4|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_287.wav|96|It happens from time to time.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_298.wav|43|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_356.wav|89|Four policemen were wounded.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_140.wav|7|I'm so grateful for that.)
DUMMY2/p243/p243_032.wav|53|Thomson and his family left court without comment.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_310.wav|24|You have to expect this type of thing.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_032.wav|80|He took me on a tour of the wards.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_055.wav|58|Everything else is second.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_238.wav|71|"In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify."
DUMMY2/p278/p278_343.wav|10|What are they for ?
DUMMY2/p265/p265_332.wav|73|The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_095.wav|44|The Premier League has been a huge success.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_291.wav|75|My body is a wreck.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_377.wav|29|It was forced to divert.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_031.wav|19|I thought it was quite good.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_328.wav|10|We believe the world has too many refugees already.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_412.wav|39|It looked like a river.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_269.wav|8|I'd never run for them.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_116.wav|27|It was the eighties.

DUMMY2/p287/p287_117.wav|77|They made such decisions in London.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_157.wav|40|The weather forecast isn't good.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_136.wav|66|He was happy, the BBC was happy, the listeners were happy.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_054.wav|97|I am going home to see my children.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_342.wav|15|They are in good spirits.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_024.wav|30|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_141.wav|40|Is that it?
DUMMY2/p256/p256_067.wav|90|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_332.wav|93|I am so upset.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_082.wav|14|It happens on an annual basis.)
DUMMY2/p295/p295_171.wav|92|The story was being repeated across Scotland.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_151.wav|103|His arguments were supported by Mr Bevan.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_216.wav|77|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_148.wav|1|There was nothing else to match it.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_199.wav|65|How do you take them away?)
DUMMY2/p333/p333_188.wav|64|That was a hard game to play in, very tough.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_111.wav|34|Football is very easy, you have to work for the team.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_165.wav|49|That nation is South Africa.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_017.wav|46|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_084.wav|0|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_050.wav|23|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_247.wav|20|There's the mix.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_215.wav|79|You can blame the defence.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_144.wav|89|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_218.wav|95|We represent a wide range of society.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_182.wav|96|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_109.wav|61|It is normal.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_109.wav|51|That is nearly four people every day.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_097.wav|50|We should recognise others have done a good job.
