DUMMY2/p329/p329_115.wav|103|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_027.wav|25|The main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_247.wav|80|There wasn't a goal.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_146.wav|4|They did not let him down.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_074.wav|32|I want the Commonwealth and European titles.)
DUMMY2/p307/p307_376.wav|22|The home was now under new management.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_176.wav|93|They know no other way.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_084.wav|82|All our futures will already have been decided.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_289.wav|50|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_037.wav|28|That was a stunning drive from Jon.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_071.wav|69|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_075.wav|54|It's been a terrible ordeal for Margaret.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_231.wav|83|We are so proud.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_147.wav|34|Do yourselves a favour.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_365.wav|82|Her life is now back on track.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_102.wav|3|It is much as it has been described.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_004.wav|49|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_320.wav|92|We were in different places, usually in cellars.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_147.wav|12|We need a new kind of theatre.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_148.wav|37|The tribunal said his conduct was wholly reprehensible.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_181.wav|26|We did everything by the book.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_342.wav|21|The Shadow Chancellor is always on holiday.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_051.wav|47|I was inspired by two things.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_353.wav|89|There was a substantial explosion.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_397.wav|23|What kind of person is he?
DUMMY2/p302/p302_299.wav|30|I really don't understand what is happening.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_218.wav|107|They could go no further forward.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_333.wav|44|In her opinion, the rich are different.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_269.wav|67|That decision is for the British Parliament and people.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_267.wav|35|I should think so, too.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_088.wav|39|A play is a set of actions.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_321.wav|65|We want immediate action.)
DUMMY2/p228/p228_332.wav|57|But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_245.wav|48|Do I think about them often ?
DUMMY2/p329/p329_289.wav|103|I have worked with him on projects.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_157.wav|58|I might have been sitting at home, with her out here.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_063.wav|54|The father was treated like a criminal, and why?
DUMMY2/p271/p271_209.wav|27|It was worth a photograph.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_252.wav|30|We could have got three medals.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_273.wav|51|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_296.wav|98|I can't believe we didn't win that game.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_232.wav|37|No-one from the Fire Brigades Union was available for comment yesterday.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_192.wav|20|I came home by ambulance.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_037.wav|47|That brought a wonderful marriage of bass and soprano.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_167.wav|35|It's nice to be nice.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_062.wav|29|They have to come up with a solution.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_379.wav|92|Surely the answer is yes.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_345.wav|22|Maybe we expected too much from the fixture.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_073.wav|47|It was chaotic.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_043.wav|22|Parts of the system are already overstretched.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_172.wav|66|In some cases, the nation should be grateful.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_348.wav|99|But nothing happened.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_035.wav|74|They were appalling, disgraceful.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_324.wav|76|The referee had a shocking game.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_228.wav|17|Things are moving together.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_246.wav|1|Mr Finnie, however, said his hands were tied.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_156.wav|20|We are looking for a good performance and a good result.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_181.wav|93|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_146.wav|69|She died at her home.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_043.wav|41|I was scared.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_204.wav|78|It is not an issue.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_268.wav|71|"The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline."
DUMMY2/p232/p232_169.wav|96|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_424.wav|95|Even if they come out playing a physical game, we can cope.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_355.wav|77|I'd like to take the plunge.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_061.wav|101|Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_056.wav|64|The performance was excellent.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_189.wav|88|We do know the reaction of the SAC.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_037.wav|65|It carried a double message.)
DUMMY2/p285/p285_268.wav|2|We're in shock.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_193.wav|12|You look at them and you understand.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_245.wav|70|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_291.wav|74|What will happen to them now?
DUMMY2/p282/p282_237.wav|83|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_433.wav|95|I would rather look at him.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_212.wav|82|He would have come into the house.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_200.wav|91|They tend to be easily influenced by others.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_172.wav|38|Three people were pronounced dead at the scene.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_104.wav|101|His is a success story by any standard.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_040.wav|41|It was clear.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_266.wav|86|It left me with a sadness.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_279.wav|55|Those three goals in five minutes changed the game.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_230.wav|10|I think, therefore I am ?
DUMMY2/p333/p333_421.wav|64|Three months or so later, they are returning.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_185.wav|104|It's a huge amount.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_387.wav|27|It is unusual.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_171.wav|57|We have to move forward.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_033.wav|93|This is the window.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_073.wav|16|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_365.wav|40|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_163.wav|38|The problem is the pitch.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_055.wav|42|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_284.wav|66|We've got a full house tonight.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_217.wav|106|Does the name matter ?
DUMMY2/p298/p298_041.wav|68|For one thing, he was growing far too quickly.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_109.wav|101|That might help a bit.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_270.wav|32|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.)
DUMMY2/p225/p225_045.wav|101|People were determined to change the Government in the last election.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_060.wav|5|Scotland had great assets.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_083.wav|32|Our mother is very worried.)
DUMMY2/p360/p360_083.wav|60|You will be very welcome.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_238.wav|31|At the time, he was a living legend.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_372.wav|74|I'm sorry if any offence has been caused.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_322.wav|24|The effect was almost magical.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_113.wav|16|It was the eighties.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_420.wav|72|That, though, was then.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_282.wav|39|It is a crisis of human rights, a crisis of leadership.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_080.wav|10|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_257.wav|75|I was just a kid.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_236.wav|104|I just have to accept that.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_390.wav|85|It changed my life.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_399.wav|65|But it is her picture.)
DUMMY2/p243/p243_119.wav|53|I left five minutes after he had finished his round.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_406.wav|14|But the foundations have been laid.)
DUMMY2/p265/p265_341.wav|73|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_341.wav|59|Sex offender programmes to be retained by public sector.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_446.wav|65|The three previous winners also came from Scotland.)
DUMMY2/p316/p316_386.wav|85|I couldn't get out of bed.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_381.wav|2|It is the old story.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_332.wav|59|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_310.wav|81|You should be.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_045.wav|50|I guess I was lucky, though.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_156.wav|70|My Dad is a hero.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_262.wav|42|With us, we just want them to respond.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_133.wav|29|They could use a boost.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_200.wav|59|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_395.wav|78|One-third of the places are already taken.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_244.wav|59|There will be widespread support on all sides.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_367.wav|60|They are not going away.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_106.wav|46|I know a lot of people who don't.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_288.wav|81|We are not going to forget.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_358.wav|39|Whether this return was too soon.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_246.wav|14|Half of young people had had contact with the police.)
DUMMY2/p301/p301_178.wav|91|The big issue for us is the review.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_061.wav|85|Everyone was very saddened.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_073.wav|55|None has ever been found.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_002.wav|85|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_398.wav|39|He has been in a nursing home for two years.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_129.wav|76|Raymond was always on the outside.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_150.wav|101|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_206.wav|9|A deadline is still essential.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_393.wav|20|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_210.wav|64|Early warnings could help, but it's a scary thought.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_203.wav|23|Nothing is ruled out.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_410.wav|107|There are simply no orders.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_038.wav|18|You go in there and do it.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_108.wav|20|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_182.wav|39|It's nice to be involved.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_300.wav|75|What are you not good at ?
DUMMY2/p274/p274_100.wav|32|Before the game we went for a pint.)
DUMMY2/p271/p271_024.wav|27|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_093.wav|100|But it is up again.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_105.wav|102|People just came on their own.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_234.wav|43|Stewart will travel with some confidence.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_344.wav|28|The then secretary was not amused.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_116.wav|93|Every woman deserves to live without this type of fear.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_154.wav|46|Christians in Pakistan are terrified.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_319.wav|87|The company hopes to repeat the process in France.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_009.wav|72|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_266.wav|24|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_378.wav|1|The Government faces a moral dilemma.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_444.wav|89|I was lost.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_347.wav|32|The business model is actually very exciting.)
DUMMY2/p261/p261_241.wav|100|No evidence that it was Osama bin Laden.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_149.wav|107|Well, it's not before time, is it?
DUMMY2/p270/p270_022.wav|8|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_037.wav|69|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_230.wav|45|But you think I'm going to argue with the big man?
DUMMY2/p334/p334_086.wav|38|We have the easy part.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_243.wav|22|His son is a local legend.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_180.wav|16|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_129.wav|72|Everyone can be bought.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_210.wav|55|If not, a deal could take many months.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_300.wav|101|I can hardly believe it.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_121.wav|61|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_226.wav|19|From our point of view, it is the right time.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_091.wav|68|There were unconfirmed reports that it was cannabis.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_286.wav|12|The law will take its course.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_142.wav|95|Last night, the row continued.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_036.wav|48|That can cost him a fortune.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_336.wav|7|Had this been common practice ?)
DUMMY2/p274/p274_457.wav|32|We're still the only ones in the High Street.)
DUMMY2/p363/p363_390.wav|6|You have to go for it.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_103.wav|93|They will want to perform well.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_185.wav|36|The referee had a good game.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_124.wav|41|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_194.wav|73|It's all about money, money, money.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_185.wav|58|It was that bad, that low.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_036.wav|12|He said he now intends to fly today.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_253.wav|53|Rangers then had a couple of good efforts.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_044.wav|60|Donald is genuine in trying to be inclusive.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_031.wav|52|Things fall a little flat elsewhere, however.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_303.wav|23|There will be no disruption to teaching.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_313.wav|91|They scored a goal, but we have to keep playing.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_032.wav|97|The country is in a state of chaos.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_004.wav|2|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_025.wav|38|A judicial review is also being considered.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_242.wav|73|There's the mix.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_138.wav|78|So what is the campaign about ?
DUMMY2/p336/p336_289.wav|98|It has become very confused.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_302.wav|31|He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_271.wav|29|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_010.wav|104|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_380.wav|68|They have their own audience in Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_183.wav|30|Smith has not let him down.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_010.wav|1|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_222.wav|40|We could easily be cut again.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_195.wav|62|I love this tournament.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_335.wav|47|She did not attend the courtroom.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_132.wav|50|Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_083.wav|42|Its first awards will do just that.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_320.wav|11|No one was listening.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_007.wav|71|"The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. "
DUMMY2/p266/p266_246.wav|20|It was a hit.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_324.wav|43|We are in the end game.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_320.wav|61|They were fantastic.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_232.wav|79|I will never see my son again.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_072.wav|99|Then followed a bout of flu.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_138.wav|17|What's the rush?
DUMMY2/p264/p264_381.wav|65|People could have a post box in the local post office.)
DUMMY2/p326/p326_393.wav|28|It is a temptation which should be resisted.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_279.wav|107|Scottish Women appear at Eden Court, Inverness, tonight.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_348.wav|62|We told them in June.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_315.wav|49|I feel sorry for the Reds.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_339.wav|70|She is free.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_273.wav|72|It was a very difficult period.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_189.wav|77|Last night was a key episode.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_207.wav|5|My neighbours are horrified.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_313.wav|95|He said he was sorry.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_301.wav|1|The eye was badly closed on Sunday.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_240.wav|62|Our commitment is to move forward.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_030.wav|63|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_077.wav|99|It is a time bomb.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_227.wav|66|Glasgow is going to be open for business.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_173.wav|60|Hopefully it will be a good day.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_259.wav|62|Who is he?
DUMMY2/p248/p248_078.wav|99|Today she has been released.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_089.wav|39|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_188.wav|20|O Neill has delivered.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_041.wav|29|He looks like an Afghan.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_356.wav|62|Bin Laden is believed to be left-handed.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_016.wav|85|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_146.wav|18|But it does not matter.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_196.wav|40|I came home by ambulance.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_259.wav|83|George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_231.wav|22|He said because people had invited him.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_296.wav|20|Spent three months alone at sea.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_049.wav|45|He had no enemies.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_239.wav|50|My future is in the marathon.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_357.wav|107|He spoke about the choices facing them, and their country.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_071.wav|100|Then followed a bout of flu.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_195.wav|44|Meanwhile, the action is spreading to Eastern Europe.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_296.wav|29|My body is a wreck.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_136.wav|72|That statement has never been withdrawn.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_242.wav|60|I'm very pleased with what we have achieved.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_222.wav|27|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_312.wav|106|She is currently the permanent secretary at the Department of Transport.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_145.wav|41|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_169.wav|97|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_322.wav|34|But it wasn't to be.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_039.wav|20|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_153.wav|39|But the Commission is on a collision course with the Government.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_367.wav|48|But the rally was short-lived.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_092.wav|46|Subs not used, McCulloch.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_262.wav|12|They failed in their duty to Mr Logan.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_277.wav|30|This is not, however, a General Election reshuffle.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_126.wav|81|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_267.wav|72|I can certainly see much better.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_352.wav|105|Then followed a bout of flu.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_002.wav|56|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_283.wav|64|It doesn't appear to be anything too serious.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_037.wav|62|That decision is now being appealed.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_216.wav|22|There are schoolboys in uniform.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_353.wav|34|At the same time it is a satire.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_274.wav|26|It is the same in Sweden.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_117.wav|2|We enjoyed it today.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_250.wav|6|The goals will come.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_209.wav|22|The prognosis is excellent.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_194.wav|74|I would be interested in another attempt.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_062.wav|26|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
DUMMY2/p261/p261_408.wav|100|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_027.wav|35|He has the courage of the unaware.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_041.wav|10|Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_002.wav|60|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_397.wav|51|It is a comforting fantasy - but it remains a fantasy.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_164.wav|9|Tell it like it was?
DUMMY2/p277/p277_329.wav|89|The package was expected to be launched within the next three months.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_111.wav|106|He's been active in Arabia.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_096.wav|20|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_197.wav|64|I didn't play well last year.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_059.wav|74|He would have been wrong.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_155.wav|53|Time may already have run out for this option.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_346.wav|62|Quite simply, no-one else is willing to do so.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_221.wav|3|However, Murray Johnstone is not on the menu.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_001.wav|7|Please call Stella.  )
DUMMY2/p257/p257_187.wav|105|Saturday is gone.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_010.wav|7|People look, but no one ever finds it. )
DUMMY2/p263/p263_258.wav|39|Three weeks later, he resigned.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_139.wav|24|This is a frightening development.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_384.wav|1|So people will come out with these things.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_384.wav|19|We have been preparing all year.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_289.wav|99|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_140.wav|32|The BBC was a disgrace.)
DUMMY2/p301/p301_274.wav|91|The pilot was making a visual approach.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_019.wav|45|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_051.wav|88|There will be no disruption in the schools.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_147.wav|101|Does the name matter ?
DUMMY2/p362/p362_129.wav|15|I feel it's time to make the switch.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_308.wav|8|The songs are just so good.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_367.wav|46|They believed it worked.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_303.wav|103|The damage from the fire was huge.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_355.wav|7|We want to play at the worlds.)
DUMMY2/p293/p293_157.wav|23|Horses have some sense.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_082.wav|0|The cut is excellent news for the consumer.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_341.wav|70|Tyson is overwhelmed.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_329.wav|67|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_187.wav|10|Says the Duke of York.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_236.wav|107|There is a club on the rise.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_468.wav|65|He dismissed the action.)
DUMMY2/p293/p293_152.wav|23|I think we have a very strong case.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_253.wav|58|There are so many artists working in Glasgow.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_473.wav|50|It was clear on Thursday.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_142.wav|76|It's typical of me.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_379.wav|15|The results are tragic.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_398.wav|51|The conclusion is enthralling.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_003.wav|70|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_293.wav|55|He is a good signing for Rangers.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_364.wav|4|Taxes may need to rise.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_074.wav|95|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_222.wav|46|Do not forget about Monaco.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_164.wav|61|I was in daily contact.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_105.wav|95|Why do it otherwise ?
DUMMY2/p336/p336_029.wav|98|Are we not men?
DUMMY2/p335/p335_003.wav|49|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_237.wav|46|Stalkers are capable of killing.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_096.wav|87|So what is the campaign about ?
DUMMY2/p307/p307_247.wav|22|He would just say it was terrible.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_142.wav|13|Now we look forward to it.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_083.wav|44|His parenthood is called into question.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_283.wav|68|Meanwhile, Rangers will continue to search for a striker.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_454.wav|37|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_328.wav|2|The outcome is not in doubt.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_096.wav|81|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_133.wav|86|It's not true.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_337.wav|60|A child is not a product.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_181.wav|31|The jury is still out.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_384.wav|55|No real attempt was made to get orders.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_396.wav|55|The new manager must make tough decisions.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_082.wav|107|PR for Westminster is their holy grail.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_078.wav|53|The key to the whole project will be environmental concern.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_241.wav|18|Are you going to win?
DUMMY2/p277/p277_331.wav|89|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_113.wav|24|Mr Wilson has received no such request.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_395.wav|36|Is there a waiting list ?
DUMMY2/p340/p340_152.wav|74|This is not quite right.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_121.wav|55|Her research is the second piece by Edinburgh University scientists highlighted recently.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_024.wav|74|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_394.wav|56|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
DUMMY2/p261/p261_154.wav|100|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_172.wav|77|Equally, he is grateful to have survived the cull.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_408.wav|4|Are you watching Liverpool?
DUMMY2/p364/p364_070.wav|88|They've got more time.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_037.wav|50|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_309.wav|80|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_391.wav|50|The response from them was good.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_157.wav|99|They should stop the bombing.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_374.wav|7|Finally came the moment of truth.)
DUMMY2/p318/p318_077.wav|19|He was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_176.wav|25|It is not either national standards or local control.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_089.wav|73|It was mayhem.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_409.wav|42|My heart is not so sure.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_171.wav|72|I've got three other ideas for the day.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_293.wav|57|Our task is to complete the picture.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_410.wav|77|That is the ultimate revenge.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_147.wav|40|He realises his mistake.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_196.wav|76|After that, though, we're still waiting to see.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_004.wav|65|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  )
DUMMY2/p255/p255_265.wav|31|They must play for each other.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_257.wav|42|This is his first movie.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_172.wav|40|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_249.wav|91|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_051.wav|71|"He looks like an Afghan."
DUMMY2/p262/p262_366.wav|45|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_339.wav|89|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_254.wav|69|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_439.wav|14|An alternative must be offered.)
DUMMY2/p285/p285_186.wav|2|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_247.wav|12|The performance, for this listener, didn't come off.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_328.wav|100|That could bring the peace process to a standstill.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_175.wav|46|It is a job creation scheme.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_413.wav|72|Which is worse?
DUMMY2/p304/p304_221.wav|72|Who would be a referee?
DUMMY2/p284/p284_140.wav|16|The idea is simple.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_252.wav|100|Nato was not a love affair.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_063.wav|81|They are real.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_278.wav|85|Footballers have also been targeted.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_106.wav|61|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_296.wav|16|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_174.wav|55|It was clearly not a battle.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_191.wav|16|They are ready.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_390.wav|52|His record on Government has always been highly effective.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_096.wav|44|The League of Nations was also his idea.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_340.wav|57|He's a genius.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_353.wav|97|It just came into my head that day.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_365.wav|1|The rear of the plane was on fire.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_411.wav|69|He got his degree.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_213.wav|17|He is very unlikely to feature against Ireland.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_138.wav|5|No-one in Downing Street can speak the language of the unions.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_095.wav|41|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_297.wav|10|This is a great opportunity for us.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_452.wav|63|No further details of expansion plans were given.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_338.wav|23|There may be some work in construction, but not enough.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_109.wav|44|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_303.wav|3|If so, it is a funny time to introduce it.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_396.wav|50|He put some colour into Scottish history.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_424.wav|11|It will be crucial.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_083.wav|78|What do we do ?
DUMMY2/p244/p244_420.wav|78|That might mean another delay.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_090.wav|81|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_396.wav|95|This is a club on the rise.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_007.wav|75|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_225.wav|94|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_019.wav|2|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_139.wav|46|He had reason to be pleased.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_010.wav|4|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_342.wav|55|They will now remain split up.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_231.wav|59|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_327.wav|75|This ruling is a farce.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_322.wav|103|Then we will face the Danish champions.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_078.wav|44|We just try to make great records.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_024.wav|46|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_342.wav|70|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_358.wav|101|The commitment was not long, and it was worth the risk.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_316.wav|5|The election is total confusion and chaos.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_178.wav|99|There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_044.wav|7|The boy is no longer with us.)
DUMMY2/p262/p262_299.wav|45|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_186.wav|69|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_350.wav|0|I have a moral dilemma.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_055.wav|31|My mother is a widow.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_237.wav|98|These were the dreams.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_323.wav|58|He's very young but he is growing up.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_256.wav|9|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_262.wav|16|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_267.wav|33|I feel pretty good.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_326.wav|37|Confidence among the allies began to slip.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_098.wav|51|I came up through the ranks.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_024.wav|1|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_074.wav|77|We did it for the jersey.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_215.wav|76|Bill Clinton always had an idea to sell.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_062.wav|85|He declined to give further details.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_002.wav|14|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  )
DUMMY2/p239/p239_158.wav|48|Our relationship has been very good.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_409.wav|20|Quality Meat Scotland was vigorous in its defence of the labelling.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_014.wav|67|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_330.wav|40|It's been hard.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_286.wav|14|It is also very valuable.)
DUMMY2/p280/p280_198.wav|52|But they had to be paid for.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_102.wav|80|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_041.wav|70|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_155.wav|75|Being involved at that level is like an addiction.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_337.wav|46|Eleven events are required.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_035.wav|55|He added that her comments were noted.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_133.wav|22|Both were later released after a check-up.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_323.wav|76|As if they ever stopped.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_368.wav|33|The pain is still acute.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_204.wav|23|We owe it to the public of Strathclyde.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_381.wav|49|You're not stopping people using sunbeds.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_057.wav|101|However, the City was in no doubt about the ultimate result.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_213.wav|5|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_180.wav|45|He will need that machine.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_115.wav|22|They hoped to remain in the Edinburgh area.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_219.wav|30|I don't know why you say goodbye.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_328.wav|76|It went on to become an annual event.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_239.wav|4|It's not a party, no, no.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_127.wav|15|Well, you don't have time.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_346.wav|5|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_141.wav|55|But this wasn't the full picture.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_403.wav|65|We will be putting in a written appeal tomorrow morning.)
DUMMY2/p252/p252_368.wav|55|They made such decisions in London.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_372.wav|41|Yesterday the company reported a further downturn in profits.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_418.wav|24|It is a large number.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_205.wav|77|I think, therefore I am ?
DUMMY2/p276/p276_464.wav|106|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_310.wav|59|It also provides a wealth of contrast within the movement.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_110.wav|61|Further protests are likely.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_161.wav|66|These matters are now behind us.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_175.wav|28|She didn't tell me anything the night before.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_295.wav|32|This is a great opportunity for us.)
DUMMY2/p280/p280_324.wav|52|It is not either national standards or local control.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_361.wav|96|I kept going for her.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_319.wav|25|The airport was even different.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_294.wav|73|You are the glory.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_139.wav|37|Brown also believes in Walker's innocence.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_135.wav|50|We must recognise that this outfit is unique.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_160.wav|74|Surely it can't get any worse.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_195.wav|68|Meanwhile, the action is spreading to Eastern Europe.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_054.wav|55|Schools will not want change.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_225.wav|67|The FBI could become involved.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_334.wav|40|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_137.wav|54|Paterson can afford to be generous.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_242.wav|29|I can't wait to meet him.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_082.wav|99|Nothing is yet confirmed.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_245.wav|11|It is just so sad.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_293.wav|83|One was a lawyer.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_475.wav|48|I am sorry, but I forgot.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_267.wav|85|This is the biggest surprise of my life.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_018.wav|59|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_337.wav|1|You let a lot of people down.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_041.wav|7|It carried a double message.)
DUMMY2/p252/p252_204.wav|55|Scotland will not vote for New Labour next time.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_373.wav|28|Since then, they have fallen by more than two thirds.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_284.wav|107|Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_228.wav|1|All these women were actors.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_372.wav|36|It's as wide as a church in here.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_336.wav|85|There will be no receivers.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_061.wav|91|That is why we want this decision reversed.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_176.wav|18|This was certainly not about money.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_365.wav|35|Alex Ferguson is the same.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_339.wav|74|It has been an extremely long haul.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_106.wav|73|I did not see any reason to change the captain.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_260.wav|54|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_256.wav|62|Promises were not kept.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_273.wav|21|Again, we were lucky.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_428.wav|8|The woman is basically off her head.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_218.wav|75|A deadline is still essential.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_421.wav|95|After the match, do you ?
DUMMY2/p274/p274_331.wav|32|She had gone to the Catholic school.)
DUMMY2/p318/p318_125.wav|19|I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_285.wav|28|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_230.wav|41|They tried to give her advice.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_048.wav|97|As far as we are concerned, he is innocent anyway.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_198.wav|76|This is a really serious issue.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_093.wav|104|But now it's back to golf.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_325.wav|65|They should try to get tickets.)
DUMMY2/p251/p251_109.wav|9|You had better believe it.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_378.wav|64|It's not just for classical music.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_171.wav|39|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_100.wav|38|Justice was not seen today.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_040.wav|54|It would show them a positive way forward.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_152.wav|15|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_113.wav|59|Next season for every manager is a long time away.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_060.wav|51|What happens next?
DUMMY2/p250/p250_052.wav|24|Planting is unlikely to start before next spring.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_312.wav|38|The public have been very supportive.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_015.wav|22|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_177.wav|84|The release attracted little attention.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_255.wav|5|Is that a serious question?
DUMMY2/p374/p374_220.wav|11|This is not a European Army.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_260.wav|90|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_019.wav|73|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_184.wav|22|I'm just asking them to improve their disciplines.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_185.wav|56|We've had an enjoyable adventure.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_054.wav|4|As a nation, we must become more active.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_240.wav|103|They were on holiday in Egypt.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_274.wav|43|She has every confidence in his performance of his duties.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_240.wav|89|There's the mix.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_213.wav|62|You can see their point.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_173.wav|1|These things are important for clubs like ourselves.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_016.wav|71|"The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. "
DUMMY2/p266/p266_355.wav|20|You must have a government and a good civil service.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_046.wav|47|Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_392.wav|78|How do you take them away ?
DUMMY2/p361/p361_021.wav|79|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_019.wav|91|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_139.wav|64|This year it will be Billy Crystal.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_070.wav|0|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_046.wav|93|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_062.wav|25|He had no enemies.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_189.wav|10|They need to look after themselves.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_117.wav|85|Or someone wants to say something different.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_348.wav|65|It looks at public interest issues.)
DUMMY2/p254/p254_098.wav|41|Global Scotland will be held at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_324.wav|57|There was no option.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_386.wav|35|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_364.wav|92|But no decision has been made.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_328.wav|12|Maybe it helps us.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_094.wav|67|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_257.wav|71|"They are never here."
DUMMY2/p301/p301_396.wav|91|It was early morning.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_016.wav|18|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_253.wav|0|His is a global perspective.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_267.wav|86|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_202.wav|83|Sadly, it can't.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_250.wav|45|I was shocked.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_307.wav|72|At Riverside, the rematch was totally different.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_458.wav|32|A fatal accident inquiry is ongoing.)
DUMMY2/p246/p246_117.wav|5|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_397.wav|42|We have understood the problems for some time.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_052.wav|48|The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_046.wav|61|There will be no shortage of quality applicants.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_317.wav|68|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_362.wav|77|This should include procedures for personal imports.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_290.wav|38|I want to keep him.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_369.wav|94|I expected these kind of questions.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_263.wav|35|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_013.wav|103|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_212.wav|64|We still don't know.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_041.wav|42|Fewer people are being killed in accidents.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_034.wav|80|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_141.wav|51|This is the high point of my career.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_132.wav|23|The firm was down and almost out.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_108.wav|77|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
DUMMY2/p236/p236_121.wav|75|He is a lovely man.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_316.wav|67|This is the culture change in medicine.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_034.wav|6|It's not an improvement for him.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_059.wav|45|And a film maker was born.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_333.wav|59|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_308.wav|79|That is a dangerous assumption.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_271.wav|78|But the government has so far failed to listen.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_326.wav|86|We agreed to disagree.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_266.wav|1|Over the last four years, we have been fairly consistent.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_244.wav|51|I don't have any answer for them.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_067.wav|9|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_150.wav|80|It is like a football team.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_147.wav|32|We have to speed up the process.)
DUMMY2/p247/p247_156.wav|14|Before it was an ordeal.)
DUMMY2/p345/p345_317.wav|82|It's always a dilemma.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_422.wav|40|The document argues that culture is at the heart of Scottish society.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_110.wav|19|I took the gun.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_393.wav|0|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_261.wav|35|You can feel at home in China.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_044.wav|13|The idea has potential for the future.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_201.wav|34|It has never been worthwhile.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_282.wav|70|She is an expert on medical ethics.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_107.wav|81|She reflects a bit.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_336.wav|91|Birthdays are wonderful and terrible things.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_406.wav|74|It is the end of an era.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_306.wav|7|It has the potential to be another North Sea.)
DUMMY2/p281/p281_109.wav|36|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
DUMMY2/p287/p287_166.wav|77|Was it the wife ?
DUMMY2/p247/p247_396.wav|14|It seems a long time ago.)
DUMMY2/p287/p287_187.wav|77|It caused a lot of upset.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_042.wav|45|The judge said.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_294.wav|37|We've had great things in the past.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_192.wav|69|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_364.wav|43|This is a club on the rise.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_264.wav|65|This term they are second bottom with three games left to play.)
DUMMY2/p363/p363_404.wav|6|She doesn't know where to begin.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_105.wav|62|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_126.wav|7|We did what we had to do.)
DUMMY2/p233/p233_336.wav|84|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_314.wav|45|The letters are going out today.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_282.wav|59|It goes back a long way.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_446.wav|106|He was due to retire in December.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_181.wav|27|As we worked.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_454.wav|75|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_060.wav|101|Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_202.wav|46|Before the games it was pretty open.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_296.wav|40|She is really magic.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_284.wav|50|Blair also had a penalty.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_318.wav|44|We have grown up in Britain.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_179.wav|23|Sadly, too, many of them are similar.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_366.wav|92|I decided not to renew the contract.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_029.wav|104|I was pregnant and very worried.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_056.wav|107|Henry was strong and talented.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_005.wav|65|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. )
DUMMY2/p243/p243_269.wav|53|They always want to give a performance.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_246.wav|105|We need to move away from the culture of long hours.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_321.wav|86|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_205.wav|22|He will emerge as a world leader.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_103.wav|59|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_206.wav|44|Most of them were one-year conscripts.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_128.wav|39|They've got to account for it.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_243.wav|28|It is just completely erased.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_022.wav|36|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_454.wav|106|They must play for each other.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_054.wav|61|It has been a horrible, horrible time.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_110.wav|38|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
DUMMY2/p302/p302_243.wav|30|I had a choice, and didn't have to do that.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_262.wav|47|This is a question of Islam.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_293.wav|17|This is not a Scottish problem.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_091.wav|59|They were outside the circle.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_126.wav|101|The squad is too small.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_161.wav|30|He will make an excellent chief inspector.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_355.wav|42|This should include procedures for personal imports.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_147.wav|63|They could use a boost.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_087.wav|30|Yesterday, one, from Aberdeen, was postponed.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_156.wav|41|The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_330.wav|69|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_169.wav|1|This is not a Scottish problem.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_229.wav|71|"Well, they were the unlucky ones."
DUMMY2/p361/p361_058.wav|79|This resulted in the following.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_080.wav|60|There was a definite prejudice.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_215.wav|65|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.)
DUMMY2/p274/p274_448.wav|32|The villagers were shot in the head at short range.)
DUMMY2/p245/p245_024.wav|59|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_034.wav|66|It's easy to see why.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_063.wav|86|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_115.wav|75|I can't even get into the A team.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_202.wav|28|The processing plant was closed yesterday.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_123.wav|60|Britain has never had it so good.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_324.wav|20|It's too horrible to think.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_286.wav|98|He had no problem with alcohol.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_145.wav|69|Who would be right?
DUMMY2/p255/p255_219.wav|31|His third goal was superb.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_092.wav|31|We could not get any possession.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_306.wav|43|We believe the world has too many refugees already.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_176.wav|42|It was like the old days.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_370.wav|31|They received a reply from their own managers.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_115.wav|90|They were behind the wheel.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_049.wav|81|Here's a clue.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_211.wav|69|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_164.wav|43|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_200.wav|101|It looked like a river.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_395.wav|47|The orchestra was already increasing the scope of its ambitions.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_264.wav|75|Clearly, the need for a personal loan is written in the stars.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_157.wav|90|He can do no wrong.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_382.wav|65|If we get a penalty next week I want to take it.)
DUMMY2/p253/p253_177.wav|70|We are the gateway to justice.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_213.wav|89|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_409.wav|54|Their expressions only reflected those of the audience.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_263.wav|30|She said he showed no remorse.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_007.wav|52|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_191.wav|42|Public safety is paramount.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_368.wav|94|We will be homeless.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_066.wav|94|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_144.wav|13|We've had an enjoyable adventure.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_284.wav|97|And that is not a bad idea.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_031.wav|71|"So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic."
DUMMY2/p247/p247_234.wav|14|Murray Financial has fallen at the first hurdle.)
DUMMY2/p360/p360_201.wav|60|I sincerely hope not.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_100.wav|63|The commission initiated the necessary changes in the financial regulation.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_050.wav|61|It is bizarre.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_043.wav|97|Had she enjoyed the experience?
DUMMY2/p230/p230_397.wav|35|Is there a waiting list ?
DUMMY2/p264/p264_127.wav|65|We have a team to reach the final.)
DUMMY2/p288/p288_173.wav|47|Tony had arrived.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_383.wav|39|The bank was now involved.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_283.wav|83|Who will perform?
DUMMY2/p293/p293_007.wav|23|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_337.wav|27|Who will do it?
DUMMY2/p361/p361_177.wav|79|However, it was a different story in the final.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_142.wav|74|I have a moral dilemma.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_165.wav|22|I'm aware that somebody made a threat.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_069.wav|65|This is far too high.)
DUMMY2/p312/p312_111.wav|62|It's so much more fun.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_012.wav|0|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_359.wav|74|It all happened so quickly.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_043.wav|56|Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_058.wav|59|It's a matter of balance.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_225.wav|8|Does that put pressure on us ?
DUMMY2/p376/p376_015.wav|71|"The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. "
DUMMY2/p287/p287_176.wav|77|He is believed to live in Britain.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_239.wav|95|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_006.wav|15|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_313.wav|38|We've got no plans with regard to recording, but who knows?
DUMMY2/p362/p362_200.wav|15|Who are the public?
DUMMY2/p267/p267_405.wav|0|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_058.wav|70|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_382.wav|54|Lambert will be playing against Belgium.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_129.wav|14|In addition, investor choice is reduced.)
DUMMY2/p299/p299_163.wav|58|Of course he is.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_309.wav|37|You were an easy target and therefore an easy sacrifice.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_227.wav|5|At the time, he was a living legend.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_332.wav|26|I'd like to take the plunge.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_267.wav|2|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_083.wav|101|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_222.wav|54|Then one night only three people turn up.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_093.wav|54|You've got it coming Kabul.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_302.wav|102|It had not been a terribly inspiring end, either.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_465.wav|106|We are having a look.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_032.wav|0|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_110.wav|6|It's harder, believe me.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_002.wav|18|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_328.wav|75|After some discussion they did.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_031.wav|93|We want to ensure that the process is entirely transparent.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_129.wav|88|They are unable to say anything.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_241.wav|73|It was a hit.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_161.wav|3|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_036.wav|29|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_014.wav|84|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_196.wav|100|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_307.wav|55|It's just an area of water.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_077.wav|102|You'd think there was a match on today.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_254.wav|2|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_016.wav|61|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_255.wav|71|"It is a crisis of human rights, a crisis of leadership."
DUMMY2/p278/p278_308.wav|10|He will address the nation this evening.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_272.wav|102|We have to sort it out ourselves.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_174.wav|29|The second aspect was the fear of failure.

DUMMY2/p374/p374_237.wav|11|That doesn't happen in Europe.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_387.wav|66|No-one has yet been charged.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_019.wav|85|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but the refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_107.wav|19|Pitt, of course, would play the lead singer.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_455.wav|63|We're still the only ones in the High Street.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_154.wav|97|We told them in June.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_207.wav|100|What are you not good at ?
DUMMY2/p271/p271_274.wav|27|The prison has been affected by unrest in the past.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_173.wav|85|He declined to provide a breakdown.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_200.wav|51|The painting was started, but finishing it was quite another matter.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_067.wav|32|How are you, sir ?)
DUMMY2/p313/p313_404.wav|76|I will never manage another Scottish club.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_303.wav|58|No decision on that was taken.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_421.wav|60|There was no happy ending.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_013.wav|89|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_326.wav|80|It could have gone either way.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_070.wav|20|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_323.wav|67|Cruelty is an accepted feature of conflict in the Balkans.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_212.wav|106|The Yugoslav army will still be there.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_020.wav|96|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_415.wav|27|But we finished the show.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_042.wav|37|We want to get back into the Champions League.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_018.wav|73|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_060.wav|82|No casualties were reported.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_107.wav|103|Scottish rugby has given me everything.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_188.wav|93|It is tough, but possible.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_253.wav|36|The pig industry is on its knees.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_172.wav|12|It was horrible, that musical apartheid.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_301.wav|44|This can only help us go forward.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_080.wav|42|We were short of athletes.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_035.wav|0|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_328.wav|38|He spoke about the choices facing them, and their country.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_132.wav|51|That's a huge amount.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_105.wav|15|Most of them were one-year conscripts.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_373.wav|93|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_158.wav|33|It is the voice of the survivors.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_127.wav|58|I've just got to build on this now.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_320.wav|57|My first concern is for the safety of the public.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_062.wav|88|You make the choice.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_231.wav|61|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_315.wav|98|But he made a mistake in picking it.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_393.wav|103|My father died in childbirth.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_145.wav|67|This represents a tough game for us.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_080.wav|32|The ethos of the school was outstanding.)
DUMMY2/p255/p255_245.wav|31|It is set in Paris.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_246.wav|60|Just one of those things, we suppose.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_337.wav|94|However, the groups denied the claims.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_008.wav|78|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_190.wav|81|Is that success?
DUMMY2/p345/p345_316.wav|82|The record companies have gone through the floor.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_315.wav|23|We will build upon the basic state pension.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_134.wav|90|Her home is perhaps a couple of miles from the town centre.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_354.wav|5|That would help.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_341.wav|96|Gaelic provision continued to be good.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_361.wav|85|It certainly gives you hope.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_371.wav|19|I see it as my job.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_411.wav|38|He added, We are not prepared for war.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_296.wav|83|They are wrong.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_321.wav|42|He was caught and fired.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_363.wav|63|We have very limited capacity.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_157.wav|12|You might even have seen him.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_332.wav|60|I don't think he played his best.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_109.wav|85|I was not a joiner.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_096.wav|25|It is an old family habit.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_037.wav|18|I don't think the action was a mistake.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_349.wav|64|But, at the same time, they made you think about life.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_315.wav|89|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_190.wav|85|Sure, he is the best player in the world.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_079.wav|11|He got his degree.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_248.wav|67|The problem in Norway is outside the National.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_212.wav|88|I can handle the pace.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_098.wav|80|Today I couldn't run on it.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_360.wav|31|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_196.wav|70|I came home by ambulance.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_283.wav|28|We will be homeless.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_136.wav|39|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_310.wav|22|Of further privacy, he had no need.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_057.wav|7|Let's hope that it does.)
DUMMY2/p240/p240_064.wav|93|Art is extra.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_023.wav|21|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_433.wav|14|Last weekend was extremely frustrating.)
DUMMY2/p288/p288_103.wav|47|It's in his blood.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_195.wav|33|I now know that from memory.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_357.wav|8|This decision is a farce.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_347.wav|49|Scottish life can be like this, too.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_077.wav|92|He said, My own position is quite simple.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_101.wav|31|Oil embargo endorsed.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_229.wav|17|I get to work with very good people.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_375.wav|53|Otherwise, we might as well hold it now.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_082.wav|6|That can only be a good thing.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_423.wav|89|I am extremely cautious.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_188.wav|79|This is positive and welcome.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_396.wav|11|However, there was hope, and glory too, for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_413.wav|49|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_228.wav|44|That will bring about a dramatic improvement.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_404.wav|1|She had travelled to Spain to give evidence.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_105.wav|5|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_369.wav|54|Now there is an even bigger target.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_039.wav|16|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_347.wav|39|The airport was even different.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_286.wav|56|The response from everyone was wonderful.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_394.wav|50|That's as good as it gets.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_326.wav|41|Finally, he paid for the movie.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_063.wav|74|Together, we can make a difference.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_244.wav|8|Corporate banking would be based in Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_130.wav|105|Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_003.wav|47|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_138.wav|35|I was caught out a little bit.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_370.wav|19|The hearing was fair.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_467.wav|50|Classes must be reduced by half.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_304.wav|2|It needs a team approach.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_009.wav|38|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_133.wav|59|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_096.wav|61|We could not get any possession.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_344.wav|25|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_008.wav|4|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_209.wav|77|I had relied on him.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_135.wav|98|Clearly, audiences are unsettled.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_250.wav|72|ALL IS busy but not much is happening.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_305.wav|11|There have been different reports from different people.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_182.wav|47|It is tough, but possible.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_040.wav|20|Dancing was her life.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_331.wav|67|He was then replaced by Ross.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_059.wav|19|It's back to how it used to be.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_264.wav|35|It is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_295.wav|105|The plot is minimal.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_275.wav|85|I am very confident about tomorrow night.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_245.wav|99|It is hard won.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_045.wav|12|They said construction work could begin within weeks.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_301.wav|4|He said he was sorry.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_166.wav|71|"I was in the train station overnight."
DUMMY2/p231/p231_108.wav|50|Before the game we went for a pint.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_242.wav|91|There are nine people here now.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_106.wav|68|The luxury has been well used.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_132.wav|54|Two charges of threatening crew members were dropped.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_471.wav|100|I'm very pleased for the club and for myself.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_153.wav|9|It is not normal practice.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_192.wav|44|I think we finished fifth.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_098.wav|24|So, did she meet him ?
DUMMY2/p304/p304_048.wav|72|We are waiting for advice on the film.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_193.wav|101|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_070.wav|86|The company yesterday refused to comment.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_021.wav|21|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_204.wav|41|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_284.wav|51|It was frightening, intense, and primal theatre.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_134.wav|39|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_375.wav|92|There is no point in looking any further.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_195.wav|104|It is misleading to compare the two.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_306.wav|10|I intended to look for another club on loan.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_124.wav|85|The two sets are different.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_183.wav|43|I have no sympathy with her at all.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_304.wav|65|I did so, making the positive case for Scottish New Labour.)
DUMMY2/p339/p339_057.wav|18|Are they going to work together again?
DUMMY2/p238/p238_433.wav|37|They are interior designers and architects.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_124.wav|94|Lady Thatcher was the only woman with full membership.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_212.wav|24|It gave no further details.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_275.wav|41|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_248.wav|2|It was a hit.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_254.wav|38|Check that he is dead.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_047.wav|83|You had better believe it.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_033.wav|82|It's a lot of pressure on me.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_308.wav|103|Clearly, that is important in nursing.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_149.wav|16|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_355.wav|58|This is normal for him now.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_248.wav|60|No one was injured.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_337.wav|99|Like his acting, it was an accident.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_019.wav|92|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_147.wav|72|They were due to have begun today.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_095.wav|33|Glasgow, however, did not get a mention.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_034.wav|54|We have high hopes that this will work.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_244.wav|90|He says that he is no different from any other man.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_291.wav|43|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_148.wav|50|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_346.wav|105|I felt really good until Friday.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_242.wav|67|The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_291.wav|21|I would rather say nothing at the moment.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_042.wav|96|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_119.wav|9|This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_191.wav|33|This was a great result for us, a big result.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_240.wav|43|She is well balanced.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_267.wav|70|One knows the feeling.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_449.wav|32|It is pretty bad news.)
DUMMY2/p252/p252_033.wav|55|Just look at his fashion sense.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_221.wav|67|She should not be blamed.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_115.wav|5|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_324.wav|33|They were impressive against France.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_018.wav|63|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_398.wav|34|I'm just asking them to improve their disciplines.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_354.wav|32|The pain is still acute.)
DUMMY2/p329/p329_129.wav|103|I didn't play well last year.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_330.wav|13|It does affect the staff and the prisoners.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_386.wav|105|He's already made history.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_097.wav|56|But the battle has only just begun.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_247.wav|65|Progress, however, is only achieved through hard work and heavy investment.)
DUMMY2/p340/p340_348.wav|74|I am an innocent man.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_131.wav|48|What are they for ?
DUMMY2/p263/p263_005.wav|39|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_011.wav|5|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_275.wav|10|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_046.wav|41|That period was a struggle.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_331.wav|58|His rival's are spoken with elan.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_079.wav|16|Today she has been released.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_151.wav|20|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_325.wav|12|It's good to start with Judith.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_292.wav|97|In my opinion it was a mistake, and never on purpose.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_139.wav|79|It has to find out what went wrong.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_060.wav|41|It is the whole package.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_132.wav|98|I just have no maternal instincts.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_222.wav|34|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_430.wav|36|Once again, they would be wrong.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_345.wav|32|Our season is not finished.)
DUMMY2/p270/p270_328.wav|8|Will have consequences for Scottish universities.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_262.wav|27|Is that a serious question?
DUMMY2/p274/p274_027.wav|32|Drugs are a serious problem.)
DUMMY2/p288/p288_213.wav|47|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_054.wav|75|The City welcomed the brighter outlook.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_117.wav|42|The singer's condition was not specified.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_114.wav|27|I am an actor.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_279.wav|35|There is a case to answer.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_385.wav|95|That can be good for us.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_071.wav|51|It's the most beautiful place on earth.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_354.wav|29|Whether this return was too soon.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_292.wav|35|It is a recipe for success.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_350.wav|52|I think the guilty ones speak for the whole lot of us.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_249.wav|103|We told them in August.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_280.wav|55|They bought the property four years ago.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_023.wav|52|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_404.wav|47|I would welcome a proper, public discussion on this issue.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_314.wav|7|It was at the Royal Concert Hall in Glasgow.)
DUMMY2/p336/p336_213.wav|98|Politics is a tough game.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_265.wav|75|You can feel at home in China.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_002.wav|93|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_259.wav|8|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_205.wav|78|They have to get that sorted.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_265.wav|57|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_370.wav|48|It didn't matter who was in their way.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_228.wav|36|I had relied on him.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_294.wav|26|Sunday's game was not a trial.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_028.wav|7|I am pretty careful with money.)
DUMMY2/p256/p256_184.wav|90|They receive a high profile in the media.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_242.wav|30|So we said, no, we're not going to do that.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_207.wav|91|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_213.wav|94|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_056.wav|65|So is that it, then?)
DUMMY2/p248/p248_320.wav|99|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_010.wav|106|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_323.wav|13|You do that because you want to win.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_221.wav|4|He denied that he was an absentee landlord.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_292.wav|37|Downing Street insisted, We have made clear that the deadline is absolute.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_247.wav|16|Is there on his hands?
DUMMY2/p238/p238_078.wav|37|No plans for projects are yet in place.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_205.wav|46|Singing has gone out of fashion.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_186.wav|59|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_168.wav|44|Can they be serious?
DUMMY2/p301/p301_288.wav|91|They had been together for about three years.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_028.wav|8|Allan Johnston was not match fit.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_025.wav|4|No sooner had we got it, than we wanted it different.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_325.wav|42|It's only tackling congestion.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_089.wav|10|We haven't finished the complaints procedure.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_101.wav|8|But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_209.wav|40|He knows a lot.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_123.wav|13|They will run a mile.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_350.wav|1|That is the consistent approach of the Government.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_310.wav|76|And we've beaten them before.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_322.wav|49|But he is revelling in the big stage.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_157.wav|73|They will do their own thing.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_361.wav|16|You must have a government and a good civil service.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_200.wav|35|We played them off the pitch.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_086.wav|30|She could easily have been killed.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_081.wav|21|Once they go away they won't come back.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_086.wav|29|This is a complex and detailed report.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_425.wav|39|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_186.wav|24|But the petrol station does not get the benefit.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_211.wav|106|Twaddle is a case in point.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_162.wav|81|They are not advertised.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_115.wav|2|It is rubbish.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_376.wav|32|Yesterday was a statement of intent.)
DUMMY2/p297/p297_184.wav|42|I think we've got the balance right.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_267.wav|100|I can't get a job.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_066.wav|106|He will need that machine.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_283.wav|32|There's not much money in cycling.)
DUMMY2/p268/p268_104.wav|87|He will be kept informed.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_170.wav|68|That, in our view, is an important decision.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_377.wav|1|We are waiting for them to calm down.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_193.wav|62|There was no question of him not impressing.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_022.wav|39|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_066.wav|62|Will you just put it away?
DUMMY2/p333/p333_074.wav|64|That would have killed the match.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_355.wav|11|But happily, the story is true.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_068.wav|78|He has not been dropped.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_059.wav|2|They are real.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_402.wav|64|There is a great potential on this river.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_374.wav|17|There may be some evidence to this effect.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_119.wav|15|He's a nice guy.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_167.wav|38|He looked very sharp.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_268.wav|41|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_229.wav|62|We're going to see more extreme weather.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_272.wav|17|The reason is the thought of Olympic gold.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_299.wav|76|The incident is being taken seriously.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_321.wav|59|It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_407.wav|51|The review has been conducted fairly.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_390.wav|23|All were within range of Israeli cities.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_254.wav|83|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_031.wav|63|She is employed on short-term contracts.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_125.wav|74|They said they were only young men.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_127.wav|101|It is a common problem.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_263.wav|48|Our position remains the same.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_088.wav|66|I still feel like a wee boy.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_280.wav|10|It does not work that way in Scottish football.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_193.wav|71|"The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address."
DUMMY2/p282/p282_156.wav|83|My Dad is a hero.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_099.wav|14|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.)
DUMMY2/p281/p281_206.wav|36|No details of the talks were given.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_107.wav|3|Everyone had to play the game.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_019.wav|74|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_078.wav|41|They never gave up hope.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_332.wav|42|The way ahead is not easy.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_165.wav|32|Further growth will be funded from cash flow.)
DUMMY2/p239/p239_302.wav|48|Mr McLeod said he believed a solution would be reached.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_307.wav|27|The court had a number of empty seats.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_019.wav|50|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_456.wav|37|Now it has doubled in size.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_025.wav|18|They missed the boat and everyone suffers.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_019.wav|10|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_104.wav|36|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_125.wav|93|I was furious.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_153.wav|57|It is not just about pay.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_169.wav|39|I would like to see the figures  for the second quarter.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_018.wav|20|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_330.wav|31|It could have gone either way.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_348.wav|3|The answer was in space.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_096.wav|88|Allison is not convinced.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_374.wav|32|It had been a magical moment.)
DUMMY2/p265/p265_044.wav|73|This is a club on the rise.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_381.wav|98|It is already making a difference.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_394.wav|25|He's already made history.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_333.wav|64|They did, too, but it didn't matter by then.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_235.wav|78|We have to win the group.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_182.wav|80|The jury is still out.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_099.wav|30|Glasgow deserved their win, but we made them look good.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_217.wav|59|I can't wait to meet him.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_153.wav|105|It became a book by itself.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_095.wav|99|Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_162.wav|70|Was this element always there?
DUMMY2/p232/p232_273.wav|96|He was also married with two children.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_049.wav|97|There is no mandate for a regime change.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_109.wav|77|So, did she meet him ?
DUMMY2/p261/p261_314.wav|100|His was a huge success story.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_408.wav|1|They offer a kind of narrative.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_052.wav|13|It was all for good reason as well.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_225.wav|95|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_185.wav|66|We've been there for seven years.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_363.wav|52|Such a policy is for long-term strength.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_307.wav|100|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_451.wav|89|There will be no repeat of that performance, that I can guarantee.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_147.wav|61|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_131.wav|49|That's the sort of game you want.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_039.wav|86|It is not for any other purpose.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_027.wav|61|I have a theory.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_009.wav|105|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_332.wav|31|I'd like to take the plunge.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_168.wav|36|Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_180.wav|56|What happened in that game ?
DUMMY2/p262/p262_169.wav|45|Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_167.wav|41|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_187.wav|36|Says the Duke of York.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_130.wav|2|Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_209.wav|7|And they were being paid ?)
DUMMY2/p360/p360_418.wav|60|There's no place to hide.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_148.wav|100|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_184.wav|98|It has been difficult for her to do, he says.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_242.wav|5|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_103.wav|69|But I was wrong.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_150.wav|7|The referee faces a massive job.)
DUMMY2/p238/p238_140.wav|37|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_245.wav|72|We want to learn lessons from that.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_055.wav|13|Ms Jackson was not at the meeting.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_140.wav|53|There was only one living room, you see.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_157.wav|62|Britain hasn't seen it in this way.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_151.wav|49|I'd say we should give it a week.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_032.wav|99|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_221.wav|50|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_289.wav|1|It's my delight on a shiny night.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_002.wav|92|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_023.wav|4|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_085.wav|79|And we have a singer.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_297.wav|36|It is a symbolic concert.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_262.wav|102|They failed in their duty to Mr Logan.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_370.wav|67|He could make it.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_276.wav|20|She failed in her action.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_169.wav|21|On reflection, it was really quite exciting.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_410.wav|75|He may have a point.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_312.wav|7|It seemed a logical expansion.)
DUMMY2/p300/p300_066.wav|102|He also does not get along with Christina.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_266.wav|88|This could be the case.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_355.wav|18|I thought to myself.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_352.wav|43|His contract was then not renewed.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_095.wav|73|We have an election in eight days.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_085.wav|17|This avalanche is just beginning.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_192.wav|4|It is all credit to them today.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_065.wav|72|If you can get away with it, you do it.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_187.wav|32|It could be done by experts and lawyers.)
DUMMY2/p227/p227_186.wav|29|They bought the property four years ago.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_321.wav|64|We are worried about casualties.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_007.wav|97|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_215.wav|2|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_275.wav|83|It's so awful.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_219.wav|98|I'm not interested in the job.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_058.wav|60|As for the warning, it was not needed.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_285.wav|4|Seaman is not a goalkeeper of old.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_130.wav|20|We work well together.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_089.wav|24|I think the industry needs a big idea to rebuild confidence.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_376.wav|84|Since then, he has played no active part in the company.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_069.wav|12|Therefore, it isn't getting the respect it deserves.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_302.wav|74|They are not left wing.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_374.wav|68|Today's ruling confirms that fact.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_139.wav|77|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_112.wav|68|Tell you the team he picked?
DUMMY2/p294/p294_116.wav|104|I want to make a vigorous defence.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_166.wav|53|It is no good thinking about Rangers at this time.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_299.wav|98|Relief was beyond belief.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_173.wav|64|Not everyone, however, was pleased with the proposed changes.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_206.wav|12|It was turning that way all across Europe.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_042.wav|33|What are the barriers?
DUMMY2/p347/p347_095.wav|46|We gave them the goal.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_346.wav|14|Do they think anyone else wants them ?)
DUMMY2/p330/p330_165.wav|1|At the time of watching, however, it is totally convincing.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_282.wav|97|For starters, many of the Scotland team didn't turn up.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_186.wav|25|It's a portrait of Glasgow, not the portrait.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_362.wav|0|I got a yellow card.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_145.wav|70|I was awful.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_202.wav|45|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_234.wav|45|It is a terrible loss.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_161.wav|91|There is no credible official announcement.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_243.wav|85|It's a scandal, a disgrace.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_269.wav|27|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_360.wav|51|There is no openness.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_052.wav|83|There is no reason at all.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_410.wav|106|Those overseas offices were great.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_155.wav|76|I, like an idiot, agreed.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_287.wav|14|There's not much money in cycling.)
DUMMY2/p243/p243_176.wav|53|Finally, we decided to put the whole speech in.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_291.wav|9|We're in shock.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_239.wav|63|Laura is an investment banker.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_208.wav|99|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_046.wav|83|It's the only thing.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_136.wav|86|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_193.wav|58|NOW it is official, Barry Ferguson is staying with Rangers.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_023.wav|5|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_349.wav|80|The decision is an absolute disgrace.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_320.wav|39|Like many companies, it is a problem.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_393.wav|82|I've never had problems with any football managers.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_186.wav|53|A great player has to win major championships.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_060.wav|27|I expect a rapid response.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_273.wav|43|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_012.wav|58|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_013.wav|107|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_391.wav|67|A council spokesman said it had been a constructive meeting.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_020.wav|91|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_309.wav|81|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_219.wav|64|If only we had known.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_058.wav|84|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_296.wav|84|Sunday's game was not a trial.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_229.wav|91|It took more than two years.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_221.wav|100|Construction is due to begin in February.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_025.wav|21|I've got a long way to go.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_014.wav|87|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_193.wav|99|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_043.wav|66|Ministers received the report with frosty reticence.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_042.wav|64|We've tried every other way.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_094.wav|85|There are no problems between us at all.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_468.wav|32|It recommended that they reject the proposed legislation.)
DUMMY2/p250/p250_265.wav|24|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_222.wav|93|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_381.wav|8|So is that it, then ?
DUMMY2/p302/p302_070.wav|30|But it was to no avail.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_115.wav|105|We do not expect any surplus.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_204.wav|44|Sometimes you get them, sometimes you don't.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_324.wav|83|However, they will only be found in the wild.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_111.wav|60|People were hitting the floor.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_062.wav|24|We have to keep our clients.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_283.wav|27|We are a grandmother.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_077.wav|91|Their one weakness was running between the wickets.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_266.wav|73|They seem to get away with it.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_069.wav|51|They knew they shouldn't have been there.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_301.wav|103|That is just a load of baloney.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_294.wav|79|No-one is a winner in this.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_006.wav|45|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_192.wav|105|Off I went.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_083.wav|61|He is driven.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_132.wav|47|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_452.wav|48|We didn't want any trouble.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_088.wav|100|It is high time to act.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_065.wav|1|We have to expand.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_328.wav|84|Who was the mystery MP ?
DUMMY2/p286/p286_084.wav|63|He has been a success this year.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_405.wav|37|Civic leaders yesterday praised the good behaviour of revellers across the country.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_422.wav|79|It's really part of our mission.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_338.wav|91|It was frightening, intense, and primal theatre.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_443.wav|27|There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_212.wav|65|Brian was last to join.)
DUMMY2/p294/p294_269.wav|104|It is a common condition in children.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_057.wav|4|It ended as it began, in confusion.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_279.wav|75|He took over our lives.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_284.wav|0|They failed to reach agreement yesterday.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_336.wav|41|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_121.wav|63|It is an impressive record.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_225.wav|77|I am not ready for Lennox Lewis.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_371.wav|21|I have to take some of the blame.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_035.wav|73|Indeed, he does.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_289.wav|35|In that moment, I was happy.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_158.wav|99|That's the name of the game, though.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_231.wav|60|We've got better players here.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_135.wav|61|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_261.wav|50|I can't get a job.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_067.wav|93|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_079.wav|57|I had my suspicions.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_033.wav|31|It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_023.wav|75|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_218.wav|73|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_152.wav|99|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_286.wav|54|In time, may prove a worthy successor to Billy Dodds.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_161.wav|45|We knew we had the goal we wanted.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_105.wav|89|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_048.wav|74|None of the pieces was commissioned.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_238.wav|61|Jim Leighton will play in the Scottish Cup final.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_141.wav|96|She died at her home.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_355.wav|3|However, a bid was never made.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_458.wav|106|It will take place in July.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_096.wav|56|We should recognise that others have done a good job.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_081.wav|93|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_306.wav|87|It caused a lot of upset.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_321.wav|3|You have to count on other people.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_166.wav|31|Eight months later, he was dead.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_348.wav|97|I am awaiting a reply.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_008.wav|9|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_101.wav|84|I had no intention of misleading anyone.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_103.wav|60|It is harder than you think.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_316.wav|77|The City welcomed the numbers.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_297.wav|11|I don't know them or anything.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_290.wav|46|Debbie Harry was cool.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_253.wav|78|Instead, he missed the lot.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_062.wav|62|The rest, of course, is history.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_030.wav|76|We have to put this behind us.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_151.wav|102|That would be poetic, wouldn't it?
DUMMY2/p301/p301_381.wav|91|It may encourage more people to prospect.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_209.wav|99|The aim is to have the reports online by this autumn.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_159.wav|90|These days are long gone.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_213.wav|97|No other vehicle was involved in the incident.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_107.wav|27|That would be unlawful.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_325.wav|102|It's good to start with Judith.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_134.wav|106|The excitement could hardly be contained.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_304.wav|48|That should give me a chance.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_325.wav|98|We don't have money to get to town.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_344.wav|5|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_015.wav|67|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_153.wav|77|They could not match it.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_167.wav|30|But even without either, Glasgow will be outstanding.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_259.wav|52|Policy making would become a role for ministers and their officials.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_014.wav|88|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_204.wav|54|It's a hidden problem.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_342.wav|57|It is not like working for a living.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_279.wav|39|They must show the commitment and the work to go with it.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_342.wav|86|I would miss him.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_091.wav|56|They like being on the front pages of the newspapers.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_311.wav|1|He will do very well.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_273.wav|69|He looked very sharp.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_384.wav|92|We all started running forward.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_358.wav|91|We must not go down that road.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_383.wav|78|For businesses, the benefits will be enormous.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_133.wav|76|I'm sorry to hear this news.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_354.wav|60|I would not do that.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_050.wav|84|The strategy is not without risk.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_163.wav|53|When Germany played there recently, the match took place in the new stadium.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_018.wav|48|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_161.wav|25|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_228.wav|26|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_013.wav|80|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_152.wav|105|They did very well.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_180.wav|58|It's not in my nature.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_140.wav|99|I was the last man to touch the ball.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_131.wav|77|Details will be published in The Herald in the coming weeks.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_370.wav|63|You did not see it.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_351.wav|47|A report is the first step in a criminal case in India.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_078.wav|24|Both sides have been hit by injury.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_224.wav|91|It had a gigantic effect.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_013.wav|2|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_172.wav|53|He said some things which were better left alone.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_380.wav|106|Market research indicates that this is not feasible.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_287.wav|83|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_395.wav|13|It is not true to Hollywood, nor The Player.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_149.wav|37|And they all have a vote.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_106.wav|99|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_076.wav|19|This was much worse.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_042.wav|7|You must always attempt to raise the bar.)
DUMMY2/p238/p238_451.wav|37|It has become a way of life.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_035.wav|86|He took me on a tour of the wards.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_039.wav|30|All of us do.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_093.wav|66|Debate was impassioned and furious.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_291.wav|104|There did not need to be a miracle.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_029.wav|20|There's a story, too.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_365.wav|11|My game is coming back.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_035.wav|13|You are in power.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_213.wav|48|People have been wonderful beyond belief.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_318.wav|28|We were very happy with our results, which were excellent.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_049.wav|60|But we are confident.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_328.wav|82|I am not against a further inquiry.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_388.wav|107|We've got to get it right.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_006.wav|77|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_102.wav|40|She reflects a bit.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_310.wav|77|You are a different people.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_409.wav|77|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_318.wav|9|He said she was mad.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_171.wav|83|You had to go and see him.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_287.wav|91|It's not unlike the millennium bug.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_375.wav|33|Our message is getting through.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_409.wav|95|Colour was at the core of his life.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_135.wav|34|Detectives are waiting to interview the men.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_299.wav|77|The rescue package is public money.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_202.wav|94|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_302.wav|69|We want to play at the worlds.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_327.wav|106|How independent is that ?
DUMMY2/p244/p244_227.wav|78|However, it is not as simple as this.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_021.wav|77|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_273.wav|81|His place in central defence was taken by John Anderson.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_278.wav|78|However, the matter is not going to end there.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_025.wav|33|It was by the numbers.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_286.wav|103|The manager is there to make these decisions.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_276.wav|71|"Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident."
DUMMY2/p256/p256_261.wav|90|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_062.wav|8|We have made a commitment to those people.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_349.wav|24|Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_291.wav|84|The attacker died in the crash.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_228.wav|30|But, by that time, of course, it is again.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_168.wav|72|It is a symbolic concert.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_092.wav|22|One film a year is, he says, his natural rhythm.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_236.wav|82|I didn't know where they were.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_386.wav|2|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_295.wav|66|They must act now to tighten the rules.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_193.wav|77|I was inspired by two things.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_221.wav|8|What was the matter for concern ?
DUMMY2/p256/p256_190.wav|90|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_387.wav|21|Because it's a secret.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_050.wav|45|We were surprised to see the photograph.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_163.wav|39|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_314.wav|41|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_385.wav|29|The salary changes are long overdue.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_091.wav|10|Thomson is expected to manage the business.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_372.wav|4|They really want to do it.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_018.wav|51|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_216.wav|75|The sanctions are about collective punishment.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_018.wav|78|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_101.wav|51|He was the deputy editor at the paper.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_054.wav|90|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_011.wav|46|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_051.wav|39|I would love to have him home.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_415.wav|46|What exactly is your job?
DUMMY2/p247/p247_107.wav|14|We haven't finished the complaints procedure.)
DUMMY2/p341/p341_236.wav|66|Nato would ensure they could return home, he said.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_311.wav|5|I'm not making any specific attempt on the world record.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_394.wav|24|I always knew she was funny.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_262.wav|97|There were no new cases yesterday.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_398.wav|19|He says it often enough.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_117.wav|72|This is not about revenge.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_250.wav|41|There's the mix.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_288.wav|29|You get a lot for your money.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_335.wav|40|He also insisted that no concession had been made to the French.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_038.wav|92|That means an extra two years.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_338.wav|53|How are you, sir ?
DUMMY2/p251/p251_097.wav|9|They were outside the circle.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_285.wav|103|Maybe this battle has been.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_355.wav|70|This is a club on the rise.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_125.wav|35|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_145.wav|12|Headteachers want their pupils to conform.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_033.wav|50|It carried a double message.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_020.wav|51|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_190.wav|10|I've always been like that.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_140.wav|64|No-one else is like Michael Jackson.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_163.wav|56|For example, I supported the government on Afghanistan and Kosovo.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_258.wav|13|That goes back a long way.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_039.wav|34|And it had two seats.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_058.wav|8|The outcome of their game isn't the important thing.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_259.wav|22|We would love for him to stay, but he's going home.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_376.wav|68|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_424.wav|33|I kept going for her.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_176.wav|33|I think we're going to make it.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_013.wav|100|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_008.wav|26|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_406.wav|95|That investment has now been secured.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_080.wav|51|I'm not going to answer that right now.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_161.wav|18|What were they told?
DUMMY2/p257/p257_208.wav|105|I am delighted for Simon.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_420.wav|13|You can cope with it.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_298.wav|90|I thought it was my only chance.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_437.wav|65|Special measures were needed.)
DUMMY2/p228/p228_162.wav|57|It was by the numbers.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_424.wav|16|He is to appeal.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_206.wav|70|Feel the heat?
DUMMY2/p362/p362_082.wav|15|It means the margin for error is tight.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_336.wav|101|I came into this world with nothing.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_095.wav|88|It was good to score the goal today.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_409.wav|18|What would you ask?
DUMMY2/p230/p230_033.wav|35|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_388.wav|35|The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_311.wav|38|The whole nation will be delighted.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_070.wav|59|Is there a new way forward?
DUMMY2/p287/p287_030.wav|77|Life was like a timetable.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_253.wav|91|JOHN Anderson, the former Scottish national coach, is still unearthing talent.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_131.wav|2|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_062.wav|107|He said it was the worst possible result.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_135.wav|103|I have so much respect for him.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_099.wav|54|I haven't enjoyed the last couple of years.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_142.wav|0|She had gone to the Catholic school.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_266.wav|92|The bombing has had a huge influence.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_287.wav|63|There's not much money in cycling.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_393.wav|69|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_131.wav|31|Our intentions are real.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_008.wav|11|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_288.wav|14|None of this work is guaranteed.)
DUMMY2/p347/p347_321.wav|46|However, the referee was not in the giving vein.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_022.wav|67|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_101.wav|6|I can't get it.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_350.wav|14|Is it worth it ?)
DUMMY2/p279/p279_333.wav|25|It will be very, very tight.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_246.wav|45|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_159.wav|49|He realises he has hit a glass ceiling.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_033.wav|4|She went home from school and never returned.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_358.wav|69|It's now down in black and white.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_023.wav|55|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_135.wav|85|It would be difficult to argue with that.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_107.wav|83|It was an adventure.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_128.wav|73|I don't know the full story.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_059.wav|58|He added, It's not a racial problem.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_079.wav|88|He wanted to talk to me about it.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_159.wav|66|That is in the very nature of farming.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_402.wav|97|Davis is very supportive, as a director.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_340.wav|60|I'm going to miss it.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_371.wav|66|You are a liar.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_248.wav|31|It has been declared.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_165.wav|90|We knew we had the goal we wanted.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_085.wav|90|It may well have been.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_291.wav|24|This could put pressure on UK inflation.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_077.wav|13|It is true, but it is only part of the issue.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_300.wav|28|So we shall remain vigilant, and keep the pressure on him.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_126.wav|0|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_032.wav|66|It has moved on in the last week.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_393.wav|22|McMaster had already seen the first part.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_129.wav|68|We have great team spirit.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_044.wav|99|That is a break with tradition.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_159.wav|50|What happened in that game ?
DUMMY2/p376/p376_173.wav|71|"First and foremost, the game is entirely different."
DUMMY2/p287/p287_238.wav|77|My future is in the marathon.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_213.wav|106|Some promoters made insulting offers.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_320.wav|12|Confidence among the allies began to slip.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_254.wav|99|We run within the law.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_155.wav|62|If you have to pay for treatment, you pay for treatment.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_144.wav|36|I was caught out a little bit.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_066.wav|103|Apart from that, they would not be making any comment.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_125.wav|104|We have very real concerns about it.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_416.wav|51|I am in a very difficult position.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_110.wav|3|We are currently working on the details.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_354.wav|66|The workers said they were treated like animals.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_069.wav|0|Her body was found on Monday morning.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_233.wav|25|Broke the birdie record.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_159.wav|77|The Hibs manager is no fool.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_157.wav|61|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_246.wav|26|It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_123.wav|82|At the moment, the success in Germany is good.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_199.wav|70|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_218.wav|87|That group reported just before Christmas.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_223.wav|93|That has been the easy part.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_366.wav|49|There was some merit in that.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_432.wav|95|He is on the wrong side.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_168.wav|100|What happened in that game ?
DUMMY2/p293/p293_200.wav|23|I always savour the company of The Voice.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_042.wav|77|Must be prepared to use it.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_336.wav|89|The performance was excellent.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_138.wav|57|We had a reunion last week.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_387.wav|62|Scotland needs to hear it, too.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_304.wav|30|The snipers are also out.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_227.wav|54|There have been a lot of lessons learned.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_091.wav|75|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_261.wav|4|I want to go now.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_027.wav|98|It is deeply worrying.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_404.wav|92|Scotland, is an increasing concern for young people.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_012.wav|54|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_148.wav|3|It is expected to last a week.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_358.wav|59|He's very explosive.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_162.wav|41|He's a nice guy.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_272.wav|96|He is a young man with a new deal.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_273.wav|93|Have a look at our accounts.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_310.wav|17|The damage from the fire was huge.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_094.wav|11|This was much worse.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_163.wav|16|Seven people were later detained by police.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_151.wav|88|It was too soon.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_176.wav|10|Why change it ?
DUMMY2/p247/p247_442.wav|14|Their condition is described as satisfactory.)
DUMMY2/p268/p268_190.wav|87|Sloppy answers are to be avoided.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_378.wav|95|He had no previous convictions.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_136.wav|2|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_148.wav|91|The fellowship is much more than a commission, he said.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_337.wav|34|He wasn't really doing anything, so he wanted out.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_337.wav|49|It is so damaging.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_018.wav|0|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_134.wav|48|Maybe he has been away from British football for too long.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_306.wav|107|We're determined to establish the facts.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_236.wav|64|It is a big time for me.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_067.wav|26|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_114.wav|78|We had planned to sell the property for some time.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_254.wav|72|And that includes the Barnett formula.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_121.wav|97|Now we need to keep our heads up.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_380.wav|8|How are you, sir ?
DUMMY2/p301/p301_335.wav|91|There was no let-up for the minnows.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_367.wav|9|He has seen the past.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_111.wav|88|I know the worry over Iraq.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_169.wav|73|They know no other way.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_035.wav|47|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_093.wav|98|When is it ever anything else?
DUMMY2/p318/p318_206.wav|19|A contractor was due to be appointed yesterday.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_344.wav|62|That's the most important thing for me.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_186.wav|33|We are still paying the price for that.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_026.wav|7|Smoking is also very important.)
DUMMY2/p227/p227_092.wav|29|For once, you should believe the hype.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_283.wav|78|If so, it is a funny time to introduce it.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_193.wav|7|You know the sort of thing.)
DUMMY2/p266/p266_361.wav|20|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_140.wav|15|She was very different.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_228.wav|72|I don't think it is vital.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_216.wav|81|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_264.wav|63|Defensive stocks attracted some interest.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_318.wav|35|They are not left wing.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_264.wav|91|It's the same old story.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_300.wav|27|Nothing is safe.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_392.wav|0|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_339.wav|55|Because I think it's there.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_411.wav|18|Where do we spend it?
DUMMY2/p244/p244_319.wav|78|Look at the potential of this club.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_352.wav|64|The feeling is awesome.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_347.wav|37|I'm very relieved that I have finally won.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_223.wav|99|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_422.wav|56|My aim is a top six finish.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_379.wav|27|It has been a lovely family occasion.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_155.wav|14|That is the ultimate revenge.)
DUMMY2/p374/p374_307.wav|11|But that's another story for another day.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_015.wav|42|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_369.wav|40|I am a wealthy person.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_326.wav|61|In the old days, it was easy.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_361.wav|22|And that match was played in June.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_033.wav|78|It is on the internet.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_050.wav|37|The whole thing was filmed in Hollywood.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_362.wav|13|You can't give in to the vandals.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_351.wav|21|As a nation, we must become more active.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_334.wav|91|There is no answer to it.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_138.wav|74|I was invited to work in Germany.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_100.wav|72|Did you get the script?
DUMMY2/p316/p316_221.wav|85|My attitude is exactly the same as before.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_096.wav|6|Where will the money come from?
DUMMY2/p310/p310_164.wav|17|And really, the songs are the key thing.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_130.wav|38|I'm sure everyone will be delighted for them.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_108.wav|22|Industry leaders reacted angrily.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_287.wav|33|I've not said anything to them, they know.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_113.wav|1|Don't say you have not been warned.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_151.wav|93|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_222.wav|10|His injury was completely random.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_341.wav|99|I'd like to take the plunge.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_014.wav|8|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_215.wav|8|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_314.wav|62|You have friends in the Liberal Democrats.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_193.wav|47|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_162.wav|18|More cases are expected.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_007.wav|93|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_175.wav|63|Further growth will be funded from cash flow.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_419.wav|74|I'll never think of myself as a star.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_241.wav|58|Even for a British Open, this is different.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_176.wav|16|Almost the day after the election, the battle lines were drawn.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_233.wav|104|We have seen the future, and it is different.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_294.wav|38|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_194.wav|71|"We've had an enjoyable adventure."
DUMMY2/p234/p234_106.wav|3|In fact, he should never have been in the field.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_387.wav|91|They want to avoid a flashpoint.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_206.wav|4|This has been a shock.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_206.wav|2|Twaddle is a case in point.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_302.wav|7|He raised the profile of the European Tour to the sky.)
DUMMY2/p256/p256_231.wav|90|My wife and family are the support system.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_085.wav|21|We should keep this recent assault in perspective.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_190.wav|4|Glasgow is a tour de force.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_368.wav|38|As a nation, we must become more active.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_127.wav|61|I'm so angry.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_271.wav|63|No production contract is yet in sight.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_070.wav|27|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_273.wav|78|I am still waiting for a reply.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_233.wav|47|I haven't made the donation yet.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_163.wav|90|We have to move forward.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_314.wav|39|Clydesdale Bank declined to comment.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_339.wav|57|I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_294.wav|49|He is also a great finisher.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_009.wav|90|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_047.wav|102|But the law is very clear on this.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_024.wav|21|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_229.wav|74|I really didn't think he would.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_136.wav|96|They took a risk.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_127.wav|8|Sentencing is due to take place tomorrow morning.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_217.wav|5|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_353.wav|92|They are a perfectly good thing in principle.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_285.wav|43|It was a virus.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_074.wav|84|We were under a bit of pressure.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_054.wav|81|Sadly, it can't.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_327.wav|13|They always seem to produce.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_292.wav|79|It was considered to be topical.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_405.wav|24|I was conceived in Aberdeen.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_387.wav|72|But it's a subtle process.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_059.wav|9|It's a real challenge.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_433.wav|100|It succeeds in a direct and convincing manner.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_373.wav|79|I just hope it's not tonight against us.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_257.wav|5|I could have got out a long time ago.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_154.wav|87|That's what happened against Ayr.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_201.wav|55|What was the matter for concern ?
DUMMY2/p281/p281_274.wav|36|He took over our lives.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_272.wav|29|I should think so, too.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_304.wav|106|Each case is treated on merit.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_062.wav|44|Don't say you have not been warned.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_140.wav|92|Seven people were later detained by police.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_140.wav|72|And yet his legacy is doubtful.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_103.wav|105|We have every respect for Michelle.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_093.wav|71|"Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom."
DUMMY2/p323/p323_116.wav|34|No passengers were on board.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_125.wav|27|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_336.wav|78|It is a sensitive issue.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_162.wav|102|Laura is an investment banker.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_144.wav|45|Mr Blair had done well.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_333.wav|29|It is so easy to be negative.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_421.wav|75|He will be judged by his actions.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_069.wav|2|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_171.wav|79|We can't go on like this.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_012.wav|59|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_290.wav|67|The orchestra is quite good, but the hall is terrible.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_333.wav|79|He has a point.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_292.wav|19|Colonel, About this committee that is coming.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_421.wav|72|People should not become complacent.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_260.wav|97|It puts the thought out, for other people to think about.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_416.wav|56|This market has been neglected by the whisky industry.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_354.wav|2|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_121.wav|52|They have no real friends in the region.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_302.wav|28|The Israeli government is destroying the peace process.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_035.wav|3|History is in the making.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_222.wav|19|If not, he should go home.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_283.wav|0|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_037.wav|35|The boy is no longer with us.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_195.wav|82|I never want to have any children.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_057.wav|49|They were later discharged from hospital.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_056.wav|94|We are a grandmother.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_236.wav|63|He must get to know himself.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_353.wav|5|Hartley should know.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_077.wav|8|It makes for an interesting conference.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_059.wav|32|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.)
DUMMY2/p310/p310_086.wav|17|Journalists should make him.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_345.wav|13|Donald was his friend.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_337.wav|104|That period was a struggle.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_199.wav|12|I like footballers who play well.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_384.wav|68|She admitted the theft of letters and deception.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_218.wav|23|The salary changes are long overdue.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_133.wav|103|If Glasgow is so interested, they have the right to bid.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_214.wav|15|It is a worry.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_370.wav|0|You must have a government and a good civil service.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_193.wav|75|Says the Duke of York.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_251.wav|106|That view has not altered.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_369.wav|35|They have broken the promise.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_285.wav|14|Many farmers cannot even agree within their own families.)
DUMMY2/p276/p276_166.wav|106|It is a good lifestyle.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_183.wav|80|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_438.wav|100|The trial will open today.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_292.wav|2|He was at home with his pals.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_288.wav|31|So I did.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_165.wav|53|But the game is still wide open.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_209.wav|72|You cannot understand it until you experience it.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_279.wav|25|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_198.wav|1|She died in hospital two hours later.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_109.wav|3|It is not affected by the sale.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_266.wav|27|Blood samples were taken.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_090.wav|19|The Parliament will make its own decisions.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_075.wav|5|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_363.wav|0|I am considered a teenager.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_376.wav|65|He was always Scottish Labour, or simply Labour.)
DUMMY2/p250/p250_329.wav|24|The takeover comes as no surprise.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_110.wav|23|So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_055.wav|37|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
DUMMY2/p293/p293_312.wav|23|The British public is nothing if not fickle.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_022.wav|103|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_378.wav|37|It was really quite amazing.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_321.wav|38|I welcome this new service.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_202.wav|71|"It was worth a photograph."
DUMMY2/p363/p363_278.wav|6|I have a problem with these things.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_237.wav|88|I am very encouraged by this poll.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_298.wav|85|I think it's difficult for Bonnie.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_371.wav|94|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_067.wav|11|They won the trophy in the Hoops.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_015.wav|62|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_162.wav|35|Had I heard ?
DUMMY2/p227/p227_320.wav|29|In that case, the children were not missing.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_397.wav|94|I suspect the latter.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_031.wav|34|Its role is not to interfere.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_503.wav|75|Lord Sainsbury is not a newcomer.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_094.wav|36|The conclusion is the same.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_180.wav|2|His name was unknown.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_266.wav|41|This is a question of Islam.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_043.wav|57|It is urgent.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_005.wav|22|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_386.wav|96|That left a bad taste in my mouth.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_249.wav|60|We have had our debate.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_137.wav|98|There is nothing like this back home.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_390.wav|65|It is the same with Barry.)
DUMMY2/p226/p226_095.wav|43|That will come after the game on Saturday.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_065.wav|106|This trend is likely to strengthen.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_091.wav|22|People love to see this stuff.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_022.wav|87|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_401.wav|24|The hope is that the outcome will be equally successful.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_311.wav|35|And we can do it.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_305.wav|65|Only one got through.)
DUMMY2/p286/p286_128.wav|63|It isn't a happy memory.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_252.wav|36|The irony was not lost.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_166.wav|19|Obviously, a lot has changed for me since then.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_416.wav|13|A venue was found.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_152.wav|69|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_096.wav|3|I had a bit in hand.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_026.wav|58|I managed to take her completely by surprise.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_175.wav|105|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_339.wav|48|My daughter is an adult.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_378.wav|47|It is a large number.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_033.wav|47|I think a move would create a lot of interest.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_180.wav|52|I am secure in my own position.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_151.wav|7|His second goal was equally impressive.)
DUMMY2/p252/p252_179.wav|55|I knew Donald Dewar.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_287.wav|101|She said the charity would continue to monitor the case.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_192.wav|83|We speak about the performance.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_413.wav|54|We suspect he was pleased.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_297.wav|5|No Briton has ever won.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_028.wav|15|I feel really good.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_301.wav|63|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_364.wav|31|Not so, it seems.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_358.wav|46|Smith has not let him down.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_179.wav|51|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_136.wav|33|However, everyone should do it once in their life.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_037.wav|43|It is a matter of the utmost concern to the Allies.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_295.wav|3|He was good, but not that good.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_033.wav|54|We had a reunion last week.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_273.wav|52|I think I was about four years old.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_180.wav|30|I foolishly had done nothing about it.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_204.wav|26|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_324.wav|53|It is not either national standards or local control.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_024.wav|87|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_076.wav|29|There may be reasons for it.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_227.wav|70|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_087.wav|98|On that they agree.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_394.wav|4|They haven't run away.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_087.wav|50|It is an old family habit.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_377.wav|56|In due course the deal was done.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_039.wav|68|We gave everything we had.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_310.wav|72|We understand the changes in the world.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_332.wav|58|The table was compiled by the Daily Telegraph.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_258.wav|49|I watched a game.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_328.wav|105|I'm very lucky.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_235.wav|90|It's a lovely, lovely film.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_224.wav|89|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_110.wav|69|You should be.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_385.wav|76|We could learn a lot from them.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_274.wav|34|The way they play, it is hard to score against them.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_342.wav|97|They were average apart, together superb.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_456.wav|50|They have to be met.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_309.wav|1|We all work for nothing.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_123.wav|63|I have learned from him.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_377.wav|6|It is a memorial.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_251.wav|42|It's there for people to look at.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_188.wav|66|He admitted there were two aspects of fear.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_325.wav|62|This is complete nonsense.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_351.wav|97|Mind you, he hasn't been back for ages.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_196.wav|102|The FBI could become involved.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_144.wav|103|The other children were severely mentally impaired.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_084.wav|96|I will miss him.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_014.wav|0|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_217.wav|20|Saturday is gone.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_098.wav|95|Little is known about them.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_065.wav|42|It's not only my respect for them.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_139.wav|54|They do the work, you know.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_214.wav|105|His death was a tragic accident.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_073.wav|12|The Prime Minister was very honest and sincere.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_188.wav|98|New Labour are running scared.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_172.wav|102|It was horrible, that musical apartheid.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_122.wav|14|However, the problem is timing.)
DUMMY2/p248/p248_293.wav|99|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_314.wav|37|Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_383.wav|50|Is it worth it ?
DUMMY2/p333/p333_065.wav|64|This is only the start of my season.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_148.wav|94|He is severe.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_026.wav|50|I'd just like to play.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_125.wav|31|Next season for every manager is a long time away.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_061.wav|93|The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_421.wav|49|But who gets on the tube?
DUMMY2/p286/p286_255.wav|63|That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_288.wav|0|What was the matter for concern ?
DUMMY2/p334/p334_336.wav|38|So just what is her enduring appeal?
DUMMY2/p312/p312_019.wav|62|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_081.wav|4|You just have to adjust.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_042.wav|97|Ten years on, that advice is beginning to pay dividends.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_258.wav|76|Or so everyone believed.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_381.wav|82|McMaster had already seen the first part.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_262.wav|28|Our place as artists is to ask questions.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_299.wav|84|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_091.wav|97|We could not compete with Rangers.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_291.wav|39|I was first in the door.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_320.wav|0|He declined to reveal the offer price which was accepted.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_406.wav|20|They were kept there for a summer.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_206.wav|16|It's not ideal.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_232.wav|30|This is her first senior Scottish selection.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_166.wav|102|Running costs are not subsidised by public money.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_003.wav|107|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_386.wav|21|They will have five minutes to decide.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_346.wav|48|I just felt that I was broken down.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_365.wav|56|That is a crazy situation.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_049.wav|92|Colin is free to speak with other teams.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_353.wav|47|It's good to start with Judith.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_316.wav|99|I think I was recorded with a video camera.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_238.wav|2|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_036.wav|53|Each brand was owned by a different family.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_230.wav|64|She will also get a pay rise.
