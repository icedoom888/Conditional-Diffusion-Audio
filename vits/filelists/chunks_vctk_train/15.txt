DUMMY2/p269/p269_009.wav|94|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_231.wav|63|And they haven't taken the foot off the gas.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_263.wav|29|The calls were last night rejected by the US and the UK.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_401.wav|13|Could they perhaps be related?
DUMMY2/p250/p250_482.wav|24|That was the first time I worked with Richard.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_328.wav|33|It's my initial background.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_039.wav|73|It's the only thing.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_092.wav|94|The name on the passport and other details have not been disclosed.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_206.wav|100|how do you get it back ?
DUMMY2/p305/p305_376.wav|54|I thought he was part of the camera.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_129.wav|13|He is adamant that he is innocent.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_212.wav|4|But who will buy it?
DUMMY2/p283/p283_240.wav|95|I rejected the idea of a separate residence.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_101.wav|46|We do not get that impression now.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_022.wav|66|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_108.wav|33|The driver was unhurt.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_100.wav|62|The plot is minimal.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_010.wav|98|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_052.wav|94|It's very odd.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_263.wav|34|It is having a big impact.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_090.wav|72|They've got their own agenda.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_314.wav|76|But they had to be paid for.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_177.wav|45|Jacques Chirac, the French president, was surely in his sights.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_027.wav|103|It's not a solo.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_338.wav|32|It is a court case.)
DUMMY2/p345/p345_169.wav|82|Other forces were, however, at work.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_385.wav|20|Since then, he has played no active part in the company.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_131.wav|20|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_298.wav|1|Breaking new ground is also very rewarding.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_169.wav|46|It was large enough to fit the wall.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_170.wav|53|That is a big risk at any price.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_331.wav|76|Everyone's too upset to comment.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_031.wav|21|Survival is our aim.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_311.wav|28|It's a record label, not a form of music.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_280.wav|48|Even more harrowing, though, was the reception from her husband and manager.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_402.wav|100|We operate as a Scottish company.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_379.wav|53|He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_198.wav|43|Is that it?
DUMMY2/p250/p250_118.wav|24|The palace said the Queen was deeply saddened.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_235.wav|72|But there is a possible place.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_005.wav|69|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_220.wav|6|Ours is on for two days.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_167.wav|17|Northern Ireland is a society divided by religion.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_183.wav|1|Euro The single currency is a fact.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_280.wav|25|They expect the minister to ensure that commitment is honoured.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_137.wav|104|It was different in the endurance events.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_255.wav|18|Why is this?
DUMMY2/p376/p376_075.wav|71|"It is a job creation scheme."
DUMMY2/p364/p364_200.wav|88|Police have refused to name the couple involved.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_152.wav|104|It's a wonderful piece of water.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_199.wav|61|The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_152.wav|62|I only wanted to give her a fright.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_347.wav|43|It was his conclusion that they were generally in good condition.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_336.wav|105|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_033.wav|1|And it had two seats.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_044.wav|70|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_404.wav|37|Everything has its place and purpose.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_294.wav|15|All is now forgiven.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_222.wav|20|I will win.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_197.wav|26|Ferguson should take note.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_187.wav|23|Of course we know them, from their work in the theatre.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_124.wav|16|I can't even get into the A team.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_187.wav|3|As, indeed, they would be.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_037.wav|75|It carried a double message.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_291.wav|5|It was a virus.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_189.wav|86|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_109.wav|73|Who would be a referee?
DUMMY2/p262/p262_204.wav|45|There was no rescue.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_191.wav|80|It is not fair.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_129.wav|21|If so, they were wrong.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_052.wav|77|I expect a rapid response.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_340.wav|49|I'm the one who has to suffer.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_218.wav|8|From there, they can go anywhere.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_226.wav|7|It was worth a photograph.)
DUMMY2/p259/p259_455.wav|7|Nobody has told the story.)
DUMMY2/p306/p306_309.wav|12|With him are the symbols of his faith.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_126.wav|103|That's why the young musicians have joined.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_106.wav|97|We have got the school holidays on.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_298.wav|35|It is a symbolic concert.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_415.wav|24|It's too close to call.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_207.wav|65|Both leaders were joined by senior party figures.)
DUMMY2/p303/p303_193.wav|44|It was not a foul.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_196.wav|28|It's not even finished.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_300.wav|50|But it is up again.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_026.wav|33|I don't think they can complain about that.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_032.wav|12|The music industry hasn't changed at all.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_321.wav|92|Thirteen people will be made redundant.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_356.wav|105|He knew his job inside out.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_253.wav|67|It is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_337.wav|19|I disagree entirely with the decision.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_341.wav|31|Nobody else was with me.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_093.wav|12|But the relief was short-lived.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_219.wav|24|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_295.wav|98|Even then it might be difficult.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_049.wav|53|Has the conflict started ?
DUMMY2/p299/p299_228.wav|58|This must be really short of ideas.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_125.wav|20|I'm so angry.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_168.wav|77|What do we want to do that for ?
DUMMY2/p238/p238_394.wav|37|He was dead on arrival at hospital.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_291.wav|89|I was brought up in a mining background.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_099.wav|103|This kind of problem arises everywhere.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_214.wav|34|His female companion was being treated for shock.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_274.wav|57|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_294.wav|94|It's like a high school play.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_356.wav|77|Appointments should be made on merit.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_020.wav|64|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_308.wav|46|A hospital spokeswoman described his condition as stable.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_302.wav|8|He was overwhelmed by the response.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_268.wav|34|It is a very beautiful city.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_003.wav|14|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  )
DUMMY2/p258/p258_413.wav|26|Domestic Disturbance is currently on general release.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_298.wav|104|Who will provide the wine?
DUMMY2/p264/p264_157.wav|65|Now it was Britain's turn.)
DUMMY2/p305/p305_195.wav|54|It just came into my head that day.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_137.wav|0|I was caught out a little bit.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_292.wav|88|I was the willing journeyman.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_247.wav|40|It was a hit.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_306.wav|99|It's about my time as a guitarist.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_270.wav|61|Special measures were needed.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_054.wav|54|We see little sign of improvement.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_211.wav|26|It had all been arranged.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_161.wav|8|What form did that take ?
DUMMY2/p280/p280_402.wav|52|Every blood test on sheep in Scotland has been completely clear.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_392.wav|26|However, it's good to turn the page.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_337.wav|40|We are the gateway to justice.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_362.wav|15|The same goes for Russia.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_416.wav|39|I'm pleased about one thing.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_060.wav|42|The tribunal continues today.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_353.wav|1|Head injuries are the leading cause of death.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_118.wav|18|We have to put this behind us.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_009.wav|101|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_100.wav|60|I have never considered it.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_383.wav|29|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_304.wav|19|I am not a fan of books.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_132.wav|52|He said a review of the planning process should encourage fresh thinking.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_278.wav|0|It is set in Paris.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_282.wav|66|I have been totally taken aback by this.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_147.wav|33|It was a discussion paper.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_246.wav|29|She died in middle age.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_355.wav|49|There is access for disabled people.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_210.wav|83|IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_352.wav|49|We were a shambles at the back.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_170.wav|84|I will tell you.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_217.wav|95|I will work on her.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_178.wav|66|They recorded their debut album in New York.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_004.wav|103|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_273.wav|67|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_357.wav|34|Yet the survey has been cautious.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_239.wav|42|Europe is not a threat to Britain.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_178.wav|52|Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_116.wav|99|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_046.wav|24|How are you, sir ?
DUMMY2/p230/p230_164.wav|35|Our position remains the same.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_183.wav|73|It is a farce.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_009.wav|36|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_112.wav|51|It is a pity, but you can't have everything.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_156.wav|51|Racism has no place in any sport.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_013.wav|21|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_351.wav|96|Everything was an effort.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_310.wav|43|It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_231.wav|73|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_341.wav|102|We won't let you down.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_373.wav|6|Only two things are certain.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_094.wav|14|They lived for their children.)
DUMMY2/p238/p238_425.wav|37|We decided we would go for a specialist inside centre.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_347.wav|94|You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_266.wav|98|The kids are paying the price.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_008.wav|22|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_057.wav|71|"Sadly, it can't."
DUMMY2/p279/p279_143.wav|25|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_340.wav|28|Self control is just one instalment.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_200.wav|70|Who will pay for this?
DUMMY2/p252/p252_154.wav|55|What are you not good at ?
DUMMY2/p305/p305_005.wav|54|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_053.wav|44|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_136.wav|28|Mr Campbell received a phone call.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_435.wav|100|He is on the wrong side.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_105.wav|100|Why do it otherwise ?
DUMMY2/p341/p341_346.wav|66|Barry will be able to handle this.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_057.wav|104|I am not here to get even.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_329.wav|44|I feel sorry for the Reds.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_079.wav|80|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_303.wav|29|We have to be very, very careful.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_393.wav|18|It is good football in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_183.wav|40|The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_099.wav|48|We will pay their bills.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_184.wav|16|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_094.wav|9|If you could find it.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_263.wav|14|He has also cut a record.)
DUMMY2/p273/p273_090.wav|56|It's not a holiday time for football players.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_009.wav|56|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_290.wav|54|Thousands of homes were left without power supplies.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_232.wav|58|What makes a house a home?
DUMMY2/p248/p248_366.wav|99|It is legally binding.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_276.wav|92|Manchester United are the classic example.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_262.wav|85|What are you waiting for?
DUMMY2/p263/p263_354.wav|39|How do you take them away ?
DUMMY2/p274/p274_012.wav|32|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbows in various ways. )
DUMMY2/p313/p313_158.wav|76|Who was on the panel?
DUMMY2/p312/p312_246.wav|62|You make the choice.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_063.wav|43|It's a real challenge.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_106.wav|86|I'm not depressed.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_170.wav|89|Again, we were lucky.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_302.wav|21|There is no point of looking any further.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_189.wav|26|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_251.wav|16|Chelsea was a great club.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_102.wav|77|There's still plenty time left.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_062.wav|35|Robin Williams is very subdued.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_020.wav|74|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_221.wav|32|The red card was okay.)
DUMMY2/p282/p282_342.wav|83|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_103.wav|102|Housing is in very short supply.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_112.wav|104|My ambition is to tell a good story.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_156.wav|8|We will turn the corner.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_305.wav|52|What happened in that game ?
DUMMY2/p244/p244_095.wav|78|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_260.wav|80|He raised the profile of the European Tour to the sky.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_071.wav|61|Try to save us.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_113.wav|84|The picture is the same across Scotland.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_220.wav|91|All the lads are totally focused on that.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_128.wav|106|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_288.wav|22|They had been together for about three years.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_139.wav|28|His expulsion would not solve the problem.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_334.wav|41|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_191.wav|26|The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_380.wav|22|It was a job he loved.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_226.wav|69|There is no excuse.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_132.wav|81|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_048.wav|94|He had no enemies.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_166.wav|97|That is a lot of writing.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_174.wav|23|The people here are quite reserved.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_107.wav|1|I'm astonished the men were not injured.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_305.wav|84|They should be swept away.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_032.wav|82|I am prepared to step down.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_302.wav|2|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_339.wav|63|The advisers had some discussions but no conclusion was reached.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_213.wav|42|The boys are very confident.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_346.wav|45|I could hardly move for the next couple of days.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_278.wav|84|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_432.wav|32|The trial will open today.)
DUMMY2/p279/p279_395.wav|25|So I did.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_270.wav|15|We are moving on.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_086.wav|4|My wife and family are the support system.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_286.wav|67|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_012.wav|70|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_101.wav|19|This is my personal assessment.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_262.wav|56|I'd never run for them.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_127.wav|43|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_137.wav|82|That's not fair to the supporters.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_361.wav|89|They have not done so this season so far.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_080.wav|0|It's so hard to shift.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_234.wav|11|They want it to work.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_057.wav|103|It is the end of an era.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_307.wav|0|It is a potential danger.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_102.wav|105|Tomorrow he will make a keynote speech on Europe.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_026.wav|106|How are you, sir ?
DUMMY2/p239/p239_119.wav|48|The Festival is prepared to help.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_079.wav|58|John Reid, the Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday appealed for restraint.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_294.wav|36|They seem to get away with it.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_010.wav|78|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_203.wav|66|Their expressions only reflected those of the audience.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_270.wav|68|His treatment has been quite atrocious.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_004.wav|88|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_112.wav|37|Harrowing is easy, after all.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_150.wav|104|It's a great idea.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_355.wav|48|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
DUMMY2/p339/p339_244.wav|18|They have to come up with a solution.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_277.wav|4|There's a lot of hysteria.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_414.wav|56|I would like to continue to develop.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_402.wav|26|It is full-scale.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_241.wav|46|Altman has every right to be bitter.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_015.wav|51|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_087.wav|54|For now, though, my future is with Rangers.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_097.wav|94|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_031.wav|77|This is a central issue.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_171.wav|95|We have a clean bill of health.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_213.wav|37|He has many offers from the English Premiership.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_006.wav|42|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_032.wav|14|It is not for any other purpose.)
DUMMY2/p341/p341_270.wav|66|I'm just doing artwork.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_021.wav|32|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. )
DUMMY2/p294/p294_394.wav|104|And rugby fans can help.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_244.wav|2|I WAS certainly wrong with my prediction of the result.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_149.wav|105|That group reported just before Christmas.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_096.wav|90|I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_290.wav|29|It would create a Scottish secretary with a lot of weight.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_316.wav|42|But there was no time for that.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_005.wav|11|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_208.wav|61|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_124.wav|82|It is sad and frustrating.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_042.wav|76|That, though, was just the start of it.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_374.wav|82|This is bound to happen.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_147.wav|99|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_467.wav|63|It also indicated that her condition had deteriorated.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_021.wav|88|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_406.wav|37|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_398.wav|52|People have a wish to charge twice.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_110.wav|63|He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_176.wav|15|Only two players have done it.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_196.wav|16|There was no safety net.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_038.wav|59|It has failed.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_310.wav|34|The son has autism and other problems.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_084.wav|42|It was the crowning point of my career.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_135.wav|6|There were no reports of casualties.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_352.wav|57|I expected these kind of questions.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_011.wav|81|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_004.wav|93|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_285.wav|105|What has altered?
DUMMY2/p272/p272_225.wav|69|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_133.wav|74|I certainly would not accept this decision.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_122.wav|20|Who would have?
DUMMY2/p286/p286_202.wav|63|It caused a lot of upset.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_018.wav|60|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_192.wav|82|Tonight's matches European Championship.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_345.wav|67|But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_099.wav|12|They are, therefore, not in favour of dispersal of sex offenders.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_213.wav|10|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_300.wav|12|We agreed to disagree.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_245.wav|79|That has to take its toll.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_284.wav|18|We're very proud of him and his achievement.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_124.wav|52|In Glasgow, a sheriff dismissed five cases yesterday without hearing evidence.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_056.wav|14|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.)
DUMMY2/p261/p261_178.wav|100|It is not either national standards or local control.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_341.wav|49|With us, we just want them to respond.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_013.wav|43|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_120.wav|61|Does this mean.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_022.wav|16|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_073.wav|36|Do I have a favourite ?
DUMMY2/p257/p257_039.wav|105|It's easy to talk about these things in the abstract.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_335.wav|12|I believe he can do a better job.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_304.wav|43|Our task is to complete the picture.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_171.wav|13|It's a technical demand.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_439.wav|39|It is not an inquiry to clear the athletes.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_474.wav|48|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_267.wav|53|The board do not own the company.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_237.wav|42|I have great confidence in Annabelle.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_051.wav|74|This has been a difficult time for me.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_227.wav|21|The service will only survive with change.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_058.wav|17|Moray Council could not be contacted last night.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_306.wav|58|They chose to side with terror.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_380.wav|48|Pensions are a long-term investment.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_065.wav|27|It's that kind of place.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_070.wav|105|The price cuts are really exciting.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_234.wav|70|It's quite a line-up!
DUMMY2/p255/p255_028.wav|31|We want to ensure that the process is entirely transparent.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_099.wav|62|We could easily be cut again.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_062.wav|99|Four other charges were dropped.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_429.wav|37|Not many people like to do that.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_311.wav|77|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_173.wav|20|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_357.wav|1|They might want to play.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_324.wav|70|However, they will only be found in the wild.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_184.wav|10|It is vital to clarify their role.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_338.wav|59|Indeed, it was magical.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_359.wav|82|However, the snow was welcomed by some.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_075.wav|59|What has changed?
DUMMY2/p361/p361_222.wav|79|It is the best place.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_202.wav|37|Do you think we are a top nation ?
DUMMY2/p261/p261_096.wav|100|The move follows a review of the Singapore
DUMMY2/p244/p244_270.wav|78|Moreover, it must be for all sports.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_263.wav|99|He will emerge as a world leader.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_083.wav|41|Both sides have been hit by injury.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_314.wav|72|It is too early to say.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_096.wav|64|He could face a jail sentence.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_340.wav|72|They should be looking at his victims.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_169.wav|90|The post will be unpaid.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_209.wav|33|It's a very important and beautiful day.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_302.wav|25|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_315.wav|106|It was horrible, that musical apartheid.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_030.wav|102|It was between myself, the management, and the team.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_352.wav|103|It is a decision which has paid off.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_202.wav|103|Hopefully, the whole of Scottish rugby was paying attention.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_040.wav|71|"It was clear."
DUMMY2/p316/p316_382.wav|85|You do need a check and a balance.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_055.wav|57|However, he will now have to wait for his chance to impress.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_294.wav|98|A wide range of restrictions are in place.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_200.wav|74|This is your life.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_266.wav|66|Before he left, the skipper said the crew were brilliant.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_210.wav|4|This time, he will be more on the defensive.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_084.wav|78|Why do it otherwise ?
DUMMY2/p264/p264_238.wav|65|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?)
DUMMY2/p308/p308_419.wav|107|It was another good idea.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_211.wav|95|A copy of the report will be sent to the them.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_014.wav|7|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. )
DUMMY2/p362/p362_258.wav|15|So, how did you do?
DUMMY2/p263/p263_197.wav|39|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_360.wav|83|Now, though, he has an incentive.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_002.wav|12|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_013.wav|6|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_199.wav|72|That would be unlawful.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_130.wav|97|Motorists will buy passes in advance.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_136.wav|62|I am so upset.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_168.wav|80|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_198.wav|54|I am saddened to hear of the accident.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_003.wav|93|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_138.wav|8|They made such decisions in London.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_261.wav|95|My wife and family are the support system.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_144.wav|37|All the employees are redundant.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_127.wav|80|There were no grounds for his action.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_167.wav|6|But that was his nature.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_313.wav|75|It was an excellent performance.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_397.wav|50|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_400.wav|58|We are working on the two things.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_206.wav|49|The text is reduced to bubbles.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_370.wav|53|I have come here to show support for the families.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_256.wav|53|The British Government should follow the Irish example.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_376.wav|4|We owe it to the public of Strathclyde.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_027.wav|107|Each one has its own system.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_237.wav|39|That you can do it.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_147.wav|105|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_135.wav|5|It seems so long since I did the exams.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_328.wav|67|It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_041.wav|60|A similar exercise is expected in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_374.wav|29|It has been made to entertain.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_313.wav|27|The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_033.wav|91|However, there are signs of dissent among his colleagues.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_025.wav|81|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_177.wav|2|I drove the ball well.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_016.wav|76|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_131.wav|36|She was also very brave.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_136.wav|19|This week is a perfect example.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_283.wav|43|He looked very sharp.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_342.wav|105|Tyson is overwhelmed.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_395.wav|87|It is sending the wrong message to people.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_249.wav|40|I can't get a job.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_381.wav|21|It has happened, and that is the end of the story.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_054.wav|47|It is unique.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_357.wav|9|The composer will conduct.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_209.wav|25|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_209.wav|84|I have a cold.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_074.wav|8|It is not in my nature.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_111.wav|97|This is the big one.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_264.wav|33|No other country has ever won this tournament.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_390.wav|27|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_111.wav|28|Hopefully they will turn out tonight.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_174.wav|15|I was a little surprised.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_150.wav|85|Because if it matters to them, it matters to me.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_295.wav|12|People will make up their own minds.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_334.wav|93|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_342.wav|33|I am proud of my team.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_069.wav|93|It should be devolved.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_039.wav|65|I wish I could see it again.)
DUMMY2/p330/p330_197.wav|1|Billie was yet to be born.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_361.wav|97|We want to replicate that success.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_083.wav|18|Or have they?
DUMMY2/p252/p252_163.wav|55|Mr Dewar understood that.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_155.wav|20|I might come back.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_355.wav|63|Scottish Newcastle will report its interim figures tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_327.wav|36|That decision will be made over the next couple of days.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_293.wav|33|It happened again, and again, and again.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_396.wav|52|We are keen to see truth and justice.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_309.wav|39|I intended to look for another club on loan.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_276.wav|12|The threat to rural areas is real.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_229.wav|56|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_317.wav|86|It is out there.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_134.wav|32|This is a major championship.)
DUMMY2/p228/p228_345.wav|57|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_164.wav|53|Surely it can't run for two years.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_286.wav|88|She died later on Monday.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_029.wav|23|Subs not used, McCulloch.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_295.wav|100|On Wednesday, it is the turn of Cable Wireless.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_120.wav|78|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_450.wav|37|Either way, it's very funny.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_080.wav|45|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_248.wav|58|It was a tactical change.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_062.wav|48|Perhaps we should do the same.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_311.wav|37|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_151.wav|70|I was stunned.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_415.wav|7|Theatre is not a museum.)
DUMMY2/p227/p227_281.wav|29|I rejected the idea of a separate residence.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_046.wav|79|The answer was wrong.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_201.wav|20|It's all about money, money, money.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_428.wav|56|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_067.wav|71|"We should have known."
DUMMY2/p261/p261_174.wav|100|I always felt they played for me.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_018.wav|101|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_098.wav|33|They have played their part.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_309.wav|11|This is as bad as it can get.

DUMMY2/p266/p266_057.wav|20|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_175.wav|44|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_173.wav|107|Now, though, he is back playing superbly for Blackburn.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_203.wav|0|There is no quick fix.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_130.wav|10|That first victory made a huge difference to my career.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_166.wav|92|He is willing to pay the required amount.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_301.wav|84|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_229.wav|99|At the time, he was a living legend.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_243.wav|84|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_380.wav|58|Do what you have to do.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_443.wav|48|They should not feel under threat.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_187.wav|102|All were paid by the taxpayer.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_421.wav|11|This is the last thing we ever expected.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_165.wav|77|Are you going to win ?
DUMMY2/p334/p334_398.wav|38|I'm sure they love it.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_307.wav|56|Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_206.wav|89|In each case they were a goal down.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_267.wav|52|The board do not own the company.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_046.wav|86|That time has passed.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_120.wav|81|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_411.wav|106|You will have seen the adverts.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_144.wav|0|It was by the numbers.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_100.wav|47|I did not think about the Ryder Cup.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_386.wav|22|We were short of athletes.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_423.wav|60|It's unfair on her.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_148.wav|70|It is not just about pay.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_397.wav|20|So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_179.wav|79|They get money for it now.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_134.wav|38|Some of his family still live there.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_320.wav|51|I am not among its admirers.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_267.wav|99|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_232.wav|6|The legal process could last weeks.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_383.wav|2|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_045.wav|60|This will take up to nine months.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_019.wav|32|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. )
DUMMY2/p255/p255_032.wav|31|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_273.wav|18|This week is a perfect example.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_014.wav|96|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_175.wav|77|They need to look after themselves.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_222.wav|74|We have no further comment to make.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_131.wav|61|Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_184.wav|58|Our members are concerned about their futures.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_196.wav|82|Business has never been so bad.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_171.wav|41|He was a crazy man.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_109.wav|19|Nothing is being offered in exchange.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_319.wav|57|Is that an issue ?
DUMMY2/p336/p336_191.wav|98|Is there a new way forward?
DUMMY2/p333/p333_249.wav|64|He's in with the furniture.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_235.wav|60|I think he was lost for words.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_042.wav|17|There are big names.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_151.wav|14|Why change it ?)
DUMMY2/p313/p313_344.wav|76|It's a question of perception.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_083.wav|94|I'd like to continue that record.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_076.wav|86|He is now resident in England.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_152.wav|37|Drink and petrol prices remain untouched.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_165.wav|92|This is great news - a wonderful addition to the programme.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_119.wav|90|I joined a group.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_011.wav|101|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_193.wav|48|In addition, margins have been maintained.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_295.wav|68|And that was the adults.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_006.wav|39|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_083.wav|83|He is in the queue.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_026.wav|17|I fell in love with the ballet.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_148.wav|55|Are you going to win ?
DUMMY2/p278/p278_142.wav|10|Anyone can do the sums.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_075.wav|75|The Festival is prepared to help.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_223.wav|45|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_135.wav|22|How good is Lennox Lewis?
DUMMY2/p245/p245_330.wav|59|Who will do it?
DUMMY2/p226/p226_042.wav|43|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_313.wav|24|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_097.wav|74|You will never get a conviction.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_338.wav|68|I'm very sad and deeply shocked.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_238.wav|51|Is he going to look after them?
DUMMY2/p318/p318_028.wav|19|I intend to raise the matter there.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_111.wav|18|I always liked to get a laugh.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_033.wav|7|We speak about the performance.)
DUMMY2/p267/p267_391.wav|0|It does not even have a staff shortage.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_065.wav|12|His rival's are spoken with elan.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_025.wav|39|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
DUMMY2/p241/p241_269.wav|86|Lottery money was intended to be used for good causes.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_077.wav|94|There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_269.wav|26|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_073.wav|5|People must remain vigilant.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_273.wav|42|I will not walk away from this job.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_203.wav|50|What are you no good at ?
DUMMY2/p343/p343_158.wav|21|It is a traffic warden.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_371.wav|52|We have been going for three years.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_118.wav|58|It is crucial for both teams.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_272.wav|10|What was the matter for concern ?
DUMMY2/p305/p305_205.wav|54|I lost a part of me.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_208.wav|21|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_371.wav|35|My goal is quite simple.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_189.wav|69|It's a fact.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_065.wav|38|He is firm but inclusive and very fair.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_299.wav|59|We are now looking at the degrees of injury.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_031.wav|57|He took me on a tour of the wards.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_041.wav|30|It could have been just a quick fix.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_254.wav|35|She took them for a term.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_277.wav|53|I think the shares are good value.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_018.wav|103|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_308.wav|4|The director's a genius.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_268.wav|82|Asylum seekers are still being attacked and abused.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_137.wav|86|It was typical.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_202.wav|3|Yet the performance was not entirely convincing.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_211.wav|65|He was a home referee.)
DUMMY2/p256/p256_164.wav|90|They are not advertised.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_315.wav|32|The songs are just so good.)
DUMMY2/p333/p333_424.wav|64|Appointed general secretary last September.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_120.wav|67|We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_068.wav|48|I'm pleased with the horse.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_043.wav|71|"We need to chat."
DUMMY2/p330/p330_008.wav|1|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_219.wav|41|We played them off the pitch.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_398.wav|62|The new incitement offence will cover all religions.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_240.wav|58|I would say so.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_044.wav|92|It is just like any other club.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_224.wav|36|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_384.wav|39|It was like a weekly wage.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_163.wav|47|It is a terrible place.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_168.wav|89|We've all had the shots.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_212.wav|73|I'd never seen a play about me.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_100.wav|13|It's about time something was done about equipment.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_251.wav|99|This year I understood.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_428.wav|40|And they replied.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_363.wav|104|It is also used to buy coffins.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_263.wav|107|She said he showed no remorse.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_105.wav|64|That's why he visited.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_011.wav|29|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_145.wav|37|His claims were criticised by Chief Secretary to the Treasury Andrew Smith.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_088.wav|57|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_275.wav|52|It is also seeking a national mortgage rescue plan.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_032.wav|44|The feeling is marvellous.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_192.wav|32|I'm interested in interesting work.)
DUMMY2/p244/p244_014.wav|78|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_146.wav|67|I was the last man to touch the ball.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_045.wav|35|I was inspired by two things.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_240.wav|70|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_030.wav|86|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_097.wav|21|What was this?
DUMMY2/p271/p271_442.wav|27|Last year, it was won by Jack McConnell, the first minister.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_066.wav|21|This happened on three days inside a week.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_395.wav|41|Apart from the result we have to be happy with our performance.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_431.wav|27|Nine days later, he suffered another attack.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_201.wav|9|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_188.wav|39|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_029.wav|76|However, it's good to turn the page.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_251.wav|93|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_146.wav|2|The weather forecast isn't good.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_054.wav|100|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_179.wav|95|This action reflects a slump in bookings.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_214.wav|0|They're going to open in early summer.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_215.wav|27|I had decided to quit the show.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_058.wav|27|It's so awful.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_226.wav|61|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_269.wav|82|It doesn't make a whole lot of difference.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_312.wav|78|In that moment, I was happy.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_072.wav|58|We have reports of this throughout Scotland.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_018.wav|93|Aristotle thought the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_031.wav|27|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_361.wav|49|It's being very carefully looked at.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_399.wav|60|These were the edited highlights.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_201.wav|64|Domestic Disturbance is currently on general release.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_341.wav|50|The figures are bad, but not that bad.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_366.wav|22|But he is revelling in the big stage.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_279.wav|52|Yesterday's session was the last full one before Christmas.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_273.wav|60|He is completely committed to us.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_347.wav|23|The feeling is awesome.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_464.wav|32|Then came the farewell to Europe.)
DUMMY2/p265/p265_297.wav|73|Surely, if anything, it would be the other way around.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_360.wav|22|I am not among its admirers.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_064.wav|28|It was a foolhardy decision.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_083.wav|45|Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_297.wav|38|We have been extremely lucky this time.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_308.wav|11|It was a foolhardy decision.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_220.wav|4|The whole thing has been a nightmare.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_072.wav|24|Robin Williams is very subdued.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_302.wav|37|What are you not good at ?
DUMMY2/p263/p263_344.wav|39|My body is clearly capable.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_137.wav|52|The Chancellor will deal from a position of strength.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_108.wav|91|Industry leaders reacted angrily.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_261.wav|76|He was in contention almost every week.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_032.wav|68|The feeling is marvellous.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_244.wav|80|We have a free vote on these things in our party.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_252.wav|68|Sub Not Used, McKenzie.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_181.wav|82|We don't know what happened.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_280.wav|22|That nation is South Africa.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_196.wav|2|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_112.wav|105|I don't have many friends.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_235.wav|11|For once it wasn't about money.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_397.wav|66|It was a sell-out.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_315.wav|35|I must do something about it.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_166.wav|36|The pension levels will remain the same.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_080.wav|36|He is in the queue.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_348.wav|36|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_288.wav|62|That was the initial attraction.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_285.wav|35|Do I think about them often ?
DUMMY2/p245/p245_311.wav|59|I never thought it would take this long.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_226.wav|105|Broke the birdie record.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_440.wav|63|It is not an inquiry to clear the athletes.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_054.wav|107|It is a serious offence of reckless conduct.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_019.wav|15|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_420.wav|48|I should think so, too.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_106.wav|24|We have made no final decisions.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_065.wav|56|We should keep this recent assault in perspective.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_127.wav|103|There is no smoking gun.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_160.wav|33|They might also be parlous.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_401.wav|18|She was on the edge of breaking point.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_394.wav|51|I cannot confirm the name of any driver.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_284.wav|14|These figures are truly terrible.)
DUMMY2/p261/p261_145.wav|100|It has become a way of life.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_304.wav|16|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_266.wav|15|He's a great dealer.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_216.wav|20|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_307.wav|19|I never had any confidence in it afterwards.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_130.wav|91|We need to move forward together.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_119.wav|25|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_395.wav|29|I felt the head was very like me.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_322.wav|64|This is my music.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_024.wav|38|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_092.wav|79|I am delighted to hear this news.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_045.wav|48|Overall it has been deeply frustrating and disappointing.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_139.wav|95|We did what we had to do.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_359.wav|102|It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_172.wav|14|It was by the numbers.)
DUMMY2/p243/p243_040.wav|53|Everyone has to prove a point when they cross that white line.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_375.wav|72|Only the details have to be sorted out.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_107.wav|28|It's a metaphor for consumption.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_187.wav|54|It is giving out the wrong message.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_235.wav|27|The move was also welcomed by the National Union of Journalists.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_063.wav|6|There wasn't anything in it.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_098.wav|8|In the end we made too many errors.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_229.wav|22|It took more than two years.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_026.wav|0|He may not need to force that message.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_158.wav|88|We want to know about the policy.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_202.wav|74|He can be beaten.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_306.wav|54|It also highlighted some local hero districts.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_127.wav|59|There is a lack of chemistry.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_319.wav|33|They were not up to the required standard.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_020.wav|29|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_210.wav|67|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_452.wav|39|But we have built a platform for next season.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_196.wav|23|We will only move forward.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_106.wav|84|In fact, he should never have been in the field.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_243.wav|70|My son was too young to die.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_043.wav|79|So, we have to go back.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_377.wav|11|Everyone here is very sad.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_322.wav|55|We are keen to see truth and justice.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_081.wav|48|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_073.wav|24|It wasn't possible to relax.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_214.wav|24|I won't make an official complaint.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_287.wav|97|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_008.wav|100|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_234.wav|61|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_103.wav|75|It's not a lack of effort.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_291.wav|68|The pollution and the driving are beyond belief.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_236.wav|43|It is set in Paris.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_240.wav|6|I think we can do well.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_195.wav|60|I'm not going to blame the band.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_240.wav|75|People should make their own decisions.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_041.wav|4|We must learn to finish.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_393.wav|62|We had no choice but to go down.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_211.wav|83|Work has started.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_336.wav|6|He is in a lot of pain, it is very distressing.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_100.wav|74|Or did it?
DUMMY2/p334/p334_040.wav|38|I wanted to win so badly.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_235.wav|43|Police later said the scheme would end in November.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_007.wav|24|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_219.wav|40|He said the winner had been chosen by consensus.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_012.wav|96|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_065.wav|88|It's not going to work.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_011.wav|14|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. )
DUMMY2/p302/p302_193.wav|30|Scottish fishermen comended the decision.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_195.wav|27|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_243.wav|13|They might well be right.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_200.wav|50|Libya is an easy target.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_018.wav|28|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_064.wav|74|That, however, was the exception.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_017.wav|75|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_067.wav|87|I would not say that.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_164.wav|62|His first album was a hit.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_169.wav|99|The post will be unpaid.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_039.wav|31|It is a memorial.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_003.wav|75|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_390.wav|20|It is unusual.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_035.wav|91|It also makes for interesting viewing.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_329.wav|13|But everywhere the problems are the same.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_330.wav|18|We have expected it.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_187.wav|38|I'm pleased to get through the opening match.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_187.wav|72|We could not get any possession.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_015.wav|19|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_274.wav|3|So far, the problems have occurred in the US.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_049.wav|85|So, why does he do it?
DUMMY2/p306/p306_061.wav|12|It's all too short term.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_290.wav|27|It was a virus.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_078.wav|15|They have broken that promise.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_138.wav|34|It's been a long, long journey.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_364.wav|28|Well, it happened to me, so it's happening to him.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_194.wav|70|Peace was won.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_220.wav|25|His death was a tragic accident.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_495.wav|65|This is yet another example of double standards from headquarters.)
DUMMY2/p249/p249_222.wav|80|Twaddle is a case in point.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_133.wav|45|She died at her home.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_318.wav|37|Sadly, it does not end there.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_234.wav|25|Police later said the scheme would end in November.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_091.wav|72|This commitment should be built upon.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_392.wav|87|Potions said he would drive.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_176.wav|78|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_176.wav|1|Glasgow is a tour de force.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_088.wav|44|At the time of watching, however, it is totally convincing.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_290.wav|62|He's also thinking long-term.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_088.wav|80|She had kept the news from him.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_238.wav|57|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_280.wav|96|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_378.wav|94|They have not done so this season so far.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_038.wav|6|The captaincy will help that, too.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_304.wav|24|He ran into immediate problems with local people and police.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_258.wav|73|Blood samples were taken.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_047.wav|11|I am inclined to play it down.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_400.wav|19|His primary residence is Scotland.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_312.wav|28|The other conditions were not specified.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_198.wav|42|We're trying to get rounded performers.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_203.wav|101|They have the cash and the fire power.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_365.wav|98|There was too much at stake.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_342.wav|63|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_096.wav|45|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_291.wav|103|His father and mother are in film production.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_126.wav|25|Lady Thatcher was the only woman with full membership.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_070.wav|85|IS Tony Blair on drugs?
DUMMY2/p238/p238_168.wav|37|They almost achieved a draw.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_414.wav|46|There can be no compromise on that demand.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_076.wav|64|I wanted the illusion of space and depth.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_041.wav|59|Indeed, he does.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_169.wav|72|He asked me how they were doing.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_326.wav|100|It is a potential danger.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_111.wav|41|It was an adventure.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_080.wav|27|The party is up for it.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_282.wav|107|I see no need for change.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_272.wav|2|He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_248.wav|12|However, BBC Scotland was not interested in his work.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_382.wav|105|It was on fire.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_155.wav|28|The main thing is that they enjoy it.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_200.wav|46|It is legally binding.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_003.wav|46|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_433.wav|105|The whole region is in shock.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_102.wav|52|We will be putting in a written appeal tomorrow morning.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_394.wav|7|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?)
DUMMY2/p294/p294_325.wav|104|He's a good player, but he's not the only one.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_158.wav|64|Christians in Pakistan are terrified.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_152.wav|79|This series is for real.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_295.wav|75|And that match was played in June.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_387.wav|65|Young people will always run away.)
DUMMY2/p258/p258_353.wav|26|I saw some good things.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_132.wav|6|There was something special about that.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_265.wav|97|Whatever happened to that one?
DUMMY2/p295/p295_046.wav|92|I'm sure he didn't mean it.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_330.wav|8|This isn't the end of story.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_143.wav|107|Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_014.wav|50|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_004.wav|101|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_184.wav|88|So it was in politics.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_122.wav|2|She really suffered for her art.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_010.wav|32|People look, but no one ever finds it. )
DUMMY2/p279/p279_364.wav|25|Breaking new ground is also very rewarding.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_281.wav|46|I am a committed European.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_051.wav|81|I was inspired by two things.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_393.wav|37|You will have seen the adverts.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_215.wav|32|I am considered a teenager.)
DUMMY2/p318/p318_103.wav|19|Although, you never know.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_463.wav|106|Now we see no mention of rising rates.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_165.wav|43|We have to move forward.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_230.wav|52|This is certainly not the time for attempts at trial by media.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_008.wav|6|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_283.wav|70|Who will perform?
DUMMY2/p286/p286_136.wav|63|However, the problem is the timing.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_341.wav|26|Indeed, it was magical.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_044.wav|53|Is it worth it ?
DUMMY2/p361/p361_335.wav|79|It is our other home.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_331.wav|12|However, within five minutes they were able to celebrate.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_369.wav|92|There are so many artists working in Glasgow.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_307.wav|8|His day had started much like any other Sunday.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_302.wav|70|There's no evidence he was ever there.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_423.wav|17|ALL IS busy but not much is happening.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_236.wav|98|It was just above the roof.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_148.wav|107|The Real IRA was blamed for the blast.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_279.wav|87|Phase one was a shambles.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_384.wav|22|It looks like paradise.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_209.wav|32|We have an election in eight days.)
DUMMY2/p254/p254_168.wav|41|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_218.wav|59|My wife and family are the support system.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_274.wav|46|You were the kidnappers.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_062.wav|96|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_093.wav|75|It is open season on the Old Firm.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_123.wav|1|Manager Neil Cooper revealed yesterday.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_262.wav|73|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_070.wav|28|Messages have to be reinforced.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_193.wav|63|They need to look after themselves.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_284.wav|81|Maloney is an engaging talent.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_126.wav|77|The deal was presented yesterday as a merger.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_318.wav|61|We want to play at the worlds.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_213.wav|64|Police have appealed for witnesses.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_036.wav|18|There was a ban on reporting the trial.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_164.wav|6|I have been very stupid.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_453.wav|65|They finished second and third.)
DUMMY2/p294/p294_218.wav|104|He was certainly upbeat about his chances.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_151.wav|57|That should do it.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_223.wav|82|Must have been at the bar.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_176.wav|94|They thought they had found a home.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_263.wav|36|The calls were last night rejected by the US and the UK.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_403.wav|69|Then , he laughs.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_332.wav|72|Surely this is not supposed to happen?
DUMMY2/p329/p329_201.wav|103|In her opinion, the rich are different.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_270.wav|22|It is believed she had serious head injuries.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_023.wav|51|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_282.wav|61|This is a question of Islam.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_092.wav|9|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_194.wav|95|It was to be inclusive.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_201.wav|51|He is married, with one daughter, and lives in Kent.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_087.wav|33|Things are meant to be.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_204.wav|81|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_401.wav|76|I found that much more challenging.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_118.wav|11|It ignores the future.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_299.wav|22|That is the first job of the director - leadership.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_251.wav|73|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_185.wav|41|I grew up listening to these people.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_029.wav|22|But we're not the same person.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_403.wav|4|The men are safe and unharmed.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_346.wav|85|Italy would be lukewarm.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_250.wav|58|When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_151.wav|67|Who would be right ?
DUMMY2/p277/p277_228.wav|89|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_304.wav|81|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_011.wav|0|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_169.wav|36|Our position remains the same.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_280.wav|103|A formal decision will be announced within months.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_289.wav|47|So I did.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_492.wav|75|The BBC was a disgrace.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_137.wav|26|If people are genuine, then the problem is not Osama bin Laden.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_242.wav|87|Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_047.wav|87|Her husband had been waiting for her return.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_105.wav|49|Which perhaps is just as well.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_205.wav|38|They serve a multitude of purposes.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_272.wav|51|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_108.wav|87|Wilson made his remarks on Tuesday.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_054.wav|25|But it might have done.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_104.wav|49|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_410.wav|16|You know the sort of thing.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_178.wav|36|I feel like my game has come a long way.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_350.wav|107|There are two games to go after that.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_025.wav|52|He has the right attitude but the wrong approach.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_324.wav|75|And he goes with it.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_403.wav|48|Turnover was highest in telecoms.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_007.wav|57|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_356.wav|104|So far he has not done so.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_250.wav|7|I didn't play too well in the third quarter.)
DUMMY2/p299/p299_375.wav|58|Their expressions only reflected those of the audience.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_421.wav|77|That's been all around Europe with me.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_224.wav|12|There is nothing like this back home.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_103.wav|33|Yes, it was too short a night.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_261.wav|99|An appeal against the sentence was dismissed the following year.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_195.wav|57|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_206.wav|66|If they don't, they might well decide not to play.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_004.wav|15|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_058.wav|41|He is too weak to move.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_376.wav|94|He could face a jail sentence.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_034.wav|98|We had a really good experience with David.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_364.wav|105|Since then, he has played no active part in the company.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_340.wav|96|Who will do it ?
DUMMY2/p316/p316_064.wav|85|This is a dream come true.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_396.wav|102|For all his successes, he is accustomed to waiting for fulfilment.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_285.wav|1|There is precious little middle ground.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_169.wav|80|They say that vital evidence was not heard in the court.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_085.wav|33|He promised a final decision within a fortnight.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_045.wav|65|We're working on it night and day.)
DUMMY2/p314/p314_047.wav|51|I only half believe it.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_137.wav|73|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_410.wav|74|Once again, he refused.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_324.wav|56|Mr Clinton was asked about his memory.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_189.wav|44|It is simple and easy to use.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_388.wav|89|It is unusual.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_256.wav|10|It seems a waste of talents.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_316.wav|85|Venus rejects the very suggestion.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_307.wav|4|That is when we are really effective.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_085.wav|38|They use them for everything.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_013.wav|38|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_351.wav|34|I did not think about the Ryder Cup.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_270.wav|83|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_038.wav|28|She didn't tell us anything new.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_205.wav|35|He had suffered a heart attack.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_259.wav|107|Of course we make mistakes, but we don't make too many.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_326.wav|32|What do they want us to do ?)
DUMMY2/p345/p345_399.wav|82|It was still there last night.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_112.wav|12|There is great relief at this point.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_018.wav|83|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_133.wav|15|Labour is providing none of these.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_408.wav|87|I should think so, too.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_008.wav|85|These take the shape of a long round arc, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_105.wav|66|He is a law unto himself.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_252.wav|92|What kind of festival is proposed?
DUMMY2/p273/p273_107.wav|56|There's still plenty of time left.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_073.wav|21|I am ready to go.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_202.wav|0|It is an impressive record.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_110.wav|28|It left me with a sadness.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_029.wav|18|What is a house without it?
DUMMY2/p364/p364_204.wav|88|It requires a wider team.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_236.wav|51|Both sides have to step back.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_334.wav|57|Tiger is the exception.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_349.wav|99|But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_349.wav|76|It's been handled entirely properly.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_382.wav|41|I am very happy with life.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_424.wav|39|We have received a number of inquiries from interested parties.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_157.wav|22|We don't just play golf in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_014.wav|15|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_215.wav|44|WHAT's in a name in this, the age of the Internet?
DUMMY2/p232/p232_043.wav|96|But it took a lot of bottle.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_107.wav|17|Or, rather, it isn't.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_091.wav|21|It's terrible that this is happening.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_118.wav|105|We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_059.wav|59|There will be tough opponents to this report.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_139.wav|17|The starting point is pretty unusual.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_164.wav|16|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_061.wav|11|It was on fire.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_312.wav|77|This will secure the future of our industry.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_097.wav|44|I've done it almost like a variety show.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_234.wav|30|I'm pleased with the horse.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_114.wav|65|But they had to be paid for.)
DUMMY2/p272/p272_351.wav|69|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_179.wav|10|His team management was protective.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_035.wav|4|With actors it is slightly different.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_312.wav|15|It is good football in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_422.wav|106|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_266.wav|61|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_337.wav|5|Our policy is clear.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_272.wav|92|It may be down, but New York is not out.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_017.wav|85|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_365.wav|23|He doesn't even know who he is.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_349.wav|105|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_418.wav|97|She was extremely rigid.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_236.wav|105|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_366.wav|15|We were getting very worried.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_071.wav|92|We would have looked out for each other.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_331.wav|27|Relief was beyond belief.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_187.wav|59|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_215.wav|106|The squad is too small.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_397.wav|29|They have not got anyone.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_122.wav|58|They married in August last year.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_172.wav|23|Family members are at her bedside.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_172.wav|95|It was by the numbers.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_143.wav|31|The way he took his second goal was brilliant.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_066.wav|3|He has not been dropped.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_131.wav|29|However, this move is dependent upon the sale of the existing site.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_189.wav|104|The First Minister is an addict.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_325.wav|105|Indeed, it was magical.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_028.wav|20|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_316.wav|61|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_372.wav|10|The selection will be made by the International Olympic Committee next year.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_065.wav|22|After this, the exercise was due to begin.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_284.wav|36|That view has not altered.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_036.wav|34|It is misleading to compare the two.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_167.wav|62|It was visibly on fire.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_173.wav|6|There are two characters.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_369.wav|42|We make good weapons.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_171.wav|101|The report was criticised by the Scottish Consumer Council.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_081.wav|75|We have turned the corner.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_047.wav|8|I had trouble with the producers.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_311.wav|7|Frankly, we should all have such problems.)
DUMMY2/p361/p361_370.wav|79|They haven't got the uniform.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_115.wav|79|This could easily have been another tragedy.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_092.wav|105|It is an old family habit.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_224.wav|78|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_045.wav|72|I was doing a charity concert.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_096.wav|82|You can't go on forever.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_347.wav|52|And the top prize draw award is certainly impressive.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_313.wav|97|Ferguson did not hesitate.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_156.wav|85|Or was it Some kind of a ham?
DUMMY2/p247/p247_379.wav|14|The group is not paying a dividend.)
DUMMY2/p238/p238_170.wav|37|This is a step backwards.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_204.wav|76|Election results are expected soon.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_050.wav|11|He had reason to be pleased.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_408.wav|13|I'm surprised to hear it from Tony.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_362.wav|96|You must have a government and a good civil service.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_286.wav|82|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
DUMMY2/p318/p318_326.wav|19|For a few years we had good fun.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_283.wav|91|Wednesday's decision came as a surprise.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_008.wav|71|"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. "
DUMMY2/p303/p303_202.wav|44|I am not a happy man.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_330.wav|26|Off with their heads.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_256.wav|48|Her political persuasion is no secret.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_428.wav|27|The weather in the area of the crash was severe.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_229.wav|38|However, there was hope, and glory too, for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_069.wav|66|We must put a marker down.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_306.wav|5|We could easily be cut again.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_197.wav|106|The feedback from them has been fantastic.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_052.wav|31|It's very odd.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_306.wav|89|You may have a short memory.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_095.wav|51|The money is not really our concern.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_206.wav|73|He said the winner had been chosen by consensus.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_227.wav|106|My daughter is an adult.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_249.wav|106|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_309.wav|62|The casting of her husband was an accident.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_018.wav|53|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_346.wav|17|More likely, perhaps, it is that he will stay in England.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_358.wav|62|It's just so sad.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_040.wav|68|I let go the telephone and ran.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_279.wav|102|But, in the end, he did - and blew him away.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_268.wav|97|Here the National Gallery has been very clever.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_121.wav|20|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_416.wav|92|There is too much at stake for that.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_245.wav|43|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_068.wav|76|However, there is great potential in this right.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_328.wav|9|Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_179.wav|102|I came home by ambulance.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_401.wav|4|Sadly, in this case, that was not so.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_392.wav|32|He has earned the right to their respect.)
DUMMY2/p316/p316_038.wav|85|What a week he has had.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_115.wav|4|Otherwise we will pay the price.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_293.wav|85|It is planned for London in the spring.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_065.wav|39|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_274.wav|59|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_301.wav|54|She is a very lucky lady.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_343.wav|40|Tell us about it.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_317.wav|96|Craig is a major concern for us.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_053.wav|0|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_011.wav|23|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he's looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_022.wav|94|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of the number of bows.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_234.wav|23|It's a way of making a mark.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_176.wav|72|The result today is an impasse.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_244.wav|64|Altman has every right to be bitter.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_244.wav|10|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_023.wav|57|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_035.wav|80|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_065.wav|93|Scotland had great assets.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_122.wav|21|Why is that?
DUMMY2/p259/p259_289.wav|7|On the contrary they stand to gain.)
DUMMY2/p270/p270_111.wav|8|The website has changed the company.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_125.wav|24|I'm delighted for everyone at Stirling.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_407.wav|0|None of the agencies was able to help.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_256.wav|105|He raised the profile of the European Tour to the sky.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_282.wav|9|That's the only thing I will say.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_259.wav|97|We have great confidence in Derek.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_050.wav|72|His father said, My son was lucky.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_302.wav|44|That left a bad taste in my mouth.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_423.wav|49|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_007.wav|12|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_131.wav|74|It is a strong case.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_212.wav|69|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_293.wav|66|Now we need to keep our heads up.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_124.wav|20|There were no grounds for his action.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_132.wav|60|I knew that we needed to get out.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_299.wav|60|Why have you decided to get married?
DUMMY2/p263/p263_429.wav|39|It is that sort of film.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_290.wav|70|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_447.wav|27|Bill is a mentor.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_179.wav|5|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_385.wav|89|It's a real problem.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_043.wav|64|Slowly, however, a picture is emerging in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_014.wav|14|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. )
DUMMY2/p243/p243_098.wav|53|Over one million people have been forced from their homes.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_363.wav|87|The performance continues to improve.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_310.wav|64|That was him under pressure.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_294.wav|99|Our task is to complete the picture.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_035.wav|94|Help is needed.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_217.wav|58|He made so many bad decisions.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_239.wav|12|It's just gotten too big.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_369.wav|39|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_141.wav|29|He's not a Celtic man.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_273.wav|55|The selection will be made by the International Olympic Committee next year.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_196.wav|60|I think that he got the message.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_317.wav|78|We want to get back into the Champions League.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_024.wav|103|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_358.wav|78|The challenge is to win a cup.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_150.wav|86|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_365.wav|57|So there, we won.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_394.wav|74|It's good to be back.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_279.wav|73|Yet, it worked.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_268.wav|28|We're very pleased about the verdict.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_148.wav|97|It was a wilful act of violence.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_352.wav|58|I have not been so angry for years.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_313.wav|79|I am not ready to walk away.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_115.wav|98|I just couldn't believe what had happened.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_206.wav|61|The sisters also became the two top players in the world.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_124.wav|13|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
DUMMY2/p225/p225_208.wav|101|You are a great player.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_231.wav|0|I didn't play too well in the third quarter.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_282.wav|13|That was the gimmick.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_034.wav|17|He didn't really, we just made that up.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_078.wav|36|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_082.wav|5|It is a blow.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_097.wav|33|This is a defining moment in this parliament.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_124.wav|72|But he admits he is deeply upset.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_324.wav|62|It's one up to the Scots.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_034.wav|64|Gaelic provision continued to be good.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_326.wav|89|These days are long gone.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_068.wav|33|That just wasn't good enough.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_268.wav|19|They just thought it was extremely good acting.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_275.wav|63|This idea has been around for four years.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_195.wav|53|And they were being paid ?
DUMMY2/p286/p286_258.wav|63|There were no reports of casualties.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_284.wav|45|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
DUMMY2/p274/p274_223.wav|32|Laura is an investment banker.)
DUMMY2/p318/p318_415.wav|19|But that night they killed her housekeeper.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_244.wav|43|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_295.wav|61|I saw it at a ruck.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_021.wav|92|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_027.wav|101|So is that it, then ?
DUMMY2/p282/p282_295.wav|83|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_130.wav|45|It seems so long since I did the exams.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_254.wav|50|No production contract is yet in sight.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_279.wav|64|It is a very interesting subject.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_233.wav|13|Anyone else can apply.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_053.wav|62|In fact, it might just be the beginning.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_023.wav|85|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_237.wav|76|We have the support of Scottish Natural Heritage.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_039.wav|26|It will come all right.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_327.wav|104|Is that what people we want?
DUMMY2/p273/p273_020.wav|56|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_053.wav|91|It also calls for licensing of collection centres.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_207.wav|61|He was also married with two children.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_068.wav|12|How things have changed since then.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_145.wav|32|No-one from the Fire Brigades Union was available for comment yesterday.)
DUMMY2/p251/p251_076.wav|9|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_056.wav|15|This was no accident.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_074.wav|97|We don't know much, but we are still awaiting news.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_285.wav|96|They were on holiday in Egypt.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_360.wav|11|One person had a broken back.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_134.wav|1|She goes to the opening of an envelope.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_319.wav|42|The company's in good shape.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_178.wav|8|The jury is still out.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_284.wav|86|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_105.wav|69|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_206.wav|93|It's all about money, money, money.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_066.wav|72|First is open defiance.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_061.wav|15|And there has been a good start.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_151.wav|5|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_283.wav|58|Some of the players have not progressed.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_354.wav|33|The Government has listened.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_134.wav|77|It has become a way of life.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_155.wav|29|It was a funny feeling.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_237.wav|90|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_264.wav|59|It left me with a sadness.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_184.wav|26|We want to help them through it.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_375.wav|98|I'm interested in all kinds of history.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_305.wav|3|By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_168.wav|35|To get good people, you need to offer them enough money.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_420.wav|56|She's had to suffer for the last six years.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_429.wav|24|That was the agreement with the manager.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_181.wav|54|Central to their cause was Barry Nicholson.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_213.wav|79|The response was really good.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_123.wav|101|It is the latter which has prompted the warning.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_191.wav|30|It's amazing it happened in daytime.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_149.wav|72|So what makes it so special?
DUMMY2/p360/p360_393.wav|60|I am in a very difficult position.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_083.wav|67|Someone who cares
DUMMY2/p361/p361_302.wav|79|It should be easy.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_122.wav|65|That was a great performance by the team.)
DUMMY2/p255/p255_030.wav|31|Life was like a timetable.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_021.wav|16|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_406.wav|98|The investment programme will deliver these improvements.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_374.wav|42|I've been thinking about it for a year.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_371.wav|2|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_004.wav|67|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_026.wav|83|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_224.wav|60|It just never comes together.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_273.wav|90|And Michael was just great.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_118.wav|34|If it does it means he has failed.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_105.wav|77|Such actions are rarely popular.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_125.wav|3|There was a lot of resentment.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_267.wav|103|He also has a Scottish grandfather.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_419.wav|37|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_350.wav|50|Is there a waiting list ?
DUMMY2/p241/p241_204.wav|86|They've got three-quarters of the way.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_132.wav|86|What will happen then?
DUMMY2/p360/p360_389.wav|60|No, they are not the same thing.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_098.wav|3|I cannot wait to get started on it.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_216.wav|95|But there's an upturn in the sector.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_010.wav|89|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_218.wav|44|We didn't know if people would turn up.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_067.wav|101|Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_333.wav|32|The group is not paying a dividend.)
DUMMY2/p253/p253_361.wav|70|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_469.wav|48|The partnership was set up during the summer.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_366.wav|101|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_264.wav|104|It possibly depends on the position.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_242.wav|18|We didn't get the supply to the forwards.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_045.wav|85|After that it is up to the boss.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_237.wav|103|Mary Archer is almost too clever.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_008.wav|104|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_334.wav|63|Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_008.wav|82|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_407.wav|36|It was the same expression of joy.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_242.wav|51|We are ready for the long haul.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_282.wav|18|No other family members could be contacted.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_327.wav|87|British Midland has applied for permission to fly to the US.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_362.wav|53|He's young enough and he must learn.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_049.wav|18|I don't think that he won't be released.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_315.wav|80|They were fantastic.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_160.wav|22|Before the game we went for a pint.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_343.wav|50|Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_297.wav|31|A new school will be built.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_216.wav|11|There was great support all round the route.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_304.wav|11|There's a story, too.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_277.wav|59|It was a virus.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_117.wav|26|You can spend money on housing.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_217.wav|93|I was so nervous.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_215.wav|47|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_340.wav|45|The Scottish Prison Service said it could not comment on the visit.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_275.wav|7|Kingfisher can afford to wait.)
DUMMY2/p247/p247_059.wav|14|So is that it, then ?)
DUMMY2/p226/p226_272.wav|43|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_363.wav|45|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_398.wav|1|Suspension will come into force at midnight.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_390.wav|66|Then came the second round.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_266.wav|85|Today was first class.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_218.wav|65|Life is still very tough for them.)
DUMMY2/p284/p284_072.wav|16|It was magic.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_099.wav|65|What are you not good at?)
DUMMY2/p318/p318_369.wav|19|His appointment was generally welcomed yesterday.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_094.wav|4|The party has never fully recovered.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_283.wav|84|I feel pretty good.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_342.wav|40|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_204.wav|82|Things were so intense in the studio.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_076.wav|1|I want to help other women.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_389.wav|82|It does affect the staff and the prisoners.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_189.wav|51|It's not unlike the millennium bug.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_114.wav|63|Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_024.wav|60|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_401.wav|97|The deadline for selecting the electors is today.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_032.wav|72|Scottish rugby has given me everything.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_038.wav|42|You have caught a serial killer.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_357.wav|104|He completely loses control.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_026.wav|90|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_246.wav|10|I need a publishing deal!
DUMMY2/p311/p311_406.wav|4|I was frustrated here.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_380.wav|70|Yet the data is compelling.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_348.wav|59|They should take their mobile phones.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_189.wav|19|They were that poor.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_218.wav|22|These findings would be made public.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_168.wav|3|It is not about the money, it is about everything.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_199.wav|51|Mixing drugs and alcohol can be extremely dangerous.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_306.wav|79|I do my job.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_099.wav|18|What you sow, you have to reap.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_178.wav|96|It's the real thing, for sure.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_328.wav|85|Nato was not a love affair.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_092.wav|15|My husband was angry.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_123.wav|48|Basically we lost the game because we were outplayed.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_024.wav|35|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_003.wav|45|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_114.wav|71|"It is a delight on every level."
DUMMY2/p243/p243_272.wav|53|The lack of joint action left many analysts concerned.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_398.wav|21|There is no formula.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_078.wav|80|He highlighted a lack of staff.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_249.wav|80|I should think so, too.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_360.wav|0|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_326.wav|42|I came into this world with nothing.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_420.wav|17|I think it's a disgrace.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_190.wav|34|It is time to come into the limelight.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_201.wav|45|They are in the euro.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_205.wav|91|He will emerge as a world leader.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_027.wav|39|So is that it, then ?
DUMMY2/p293/p293_392.wav|23|The aircraft was totally destroyed.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_264.wav|93|They must play for each other.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_097.wav|98|This is in a league of its own.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_351.wav|100|The whole family was in shock.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_356.wav|107|This is a dreadful day for Iona.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_173.wav|25|Is Saddam a threat?
DUMMY2/p257/p257_160.wav|105|It was so new, so exciting.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_390.wav|56|Rugby is a hard game.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_074.wav|103|They seem to be backing off from that.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_124.wav|60|So many people will be affected by this.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_179.wav|20|I'm just going to hit the shot.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_318.wav|106|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_318.wav|104|Now they have found out the truth.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_130.wav|4|Still, some additions are inspired.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_221.wav|19|It sounds like an appalling, tragic incident.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_323.wav|56|The woman is basically off her head.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_274.wav|61|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_356.wav|45|It is horrible.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_307.wav|90|It is no surprise.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_116.wav|75|In addition, investor choice is reduced.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_119.wav|45|Next season for every manager is a long time away.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_303.wav|49|This looks like it is anything but open.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_241.wav|82|I can't describe it.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_078.wav|98|I get the bus.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_190.wav|46|Glasgow then took control.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_217.wav|24|The move follows a review of the Singapore
DUMMY2/p247/p247_150.wav|14|Was it the wife ?)
DUMMY2/p312/p312_125.wav|62|There was some merit in that.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_150.wav|63|Was it the wife ?
DUMMY2/p318/p318_046.wav|19|Its effect on humans is not yet known.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_364.wav|106|He worked there for six months.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_298.wav|41|One was a lawyer.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_420.wav|95|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
DUMMY2/p267/p267_304.wav|0|The weather forecast isn't good.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_002.wav|84|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_187.wav|22|Ferguson had a most productive afternoon.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_200.wav|13|Drugs are always an issue.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_478.wav|24|Well, he is an artist.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_144.wav|9|We have seen a copy of the report.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_263.wav|96|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_141.wav|95|But it is different in different regions.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_338.wav|36|Did it work ?
DUMMY2/p237/p237_245.wav|61|Of course, that is not the whole story.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_133.wav|61|Who will attend ?
DUMMY2/p236/p236_423.wav|75|It is an absolute nonsense.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_328.wav|44|Who is going to be penalised?
DUMMY2/p268/p268_056.wav|87|The whole thing was filmed in Hollywood.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_077.wav|96|It was chaotic.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_124.wav|50|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_060.wav|107|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_389.wav|19|That time is not far away.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_085.wav|7|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?)
DUMMY2/p362/p362_084.wav|15|She is now on the back benches.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_286.wav|86|A tribunal would then consider the seriousness of the incident.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_086.wav|64|That is in the public domain.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_018.wav|89|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_173.wav|35|But he has a lifeline.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_275.wav|58|The things writers and directors say!
DUMMY2/p304/p304_177.wav|72|Nelson does not disappoint.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_325.wav|37|Their conclusions were never published.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_239.wav|19|I was an athlete.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_339.wav|20|This is a big advantage.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_063.wav|40|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_002.wav|33|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_293.wav|23|If so, we want to hear from them.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_179.wav|59|The conference is the first test.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_234.wav|105|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_247.wav|61|It is not the message alone.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_183.wav|104|It was a big departure.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_150.wav|65|Did he trip?)
DUMMY2/p243/p243_322.wav|53|We will not simply hit these people.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_040.wav|102|Some people begin to turn away, to go home.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_122.wav|90|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_240.wav|56|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_043.wav|69|Indeed, he does.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_299.wav|28|He was visited by UK consular officials.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_197.wav|93|It wasn't to be.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_192.wav|28|So You Think You Want  to be Victoria?
DUMMY2/p305/p305_283.wav|54|It was worth a photograph.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_141.wav|59|He can do no wrong.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_345.wav|96|Indeed, it was magical.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_362.wav|97|We were lucky to have survived.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_339.wav|65|Time remains to put other candidates forward.)
DUMMY2/p316/p316_353.wav|85|It was just awful.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_090.wav|84|Why do it otherwise ?
DUMMY2/p280/p280_356.wav|52|The deal is expected to be completed by September.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_342.wav|10|What form did that take ?
DUMMY2/p246/p246_126.wav|5|She said she would not welcome the flowers.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_236.wav|36|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_160.wav|91|Before the game we went for a pint.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_218.wav|61|She should not be blamed.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_023.wav|33|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_043.wav|24|This represents a tough game for us.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_324.wav|37|Celtic were the losers then.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_045.wav|2|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_189.wav|59|That will be vital.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_422.wav|16|I've invented a village in East Lothian.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_152.wav|8|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_060.wav|105|There was a battle there.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_396.wav|19|Of course, it is a tough assignment.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_393.wav|107|He lost his job, but it was not just a job.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_065.wav|24|This is the first step.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_061.wav|103|His charisma is all on the course.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_388.wav|42|We have big ideas.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_325.wav|54|Here are some possible solutions.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_335.wav|68|Last year, it was ligaments in his knee.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_129.wav|47|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_331.wav|93|Donald was his friend.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_266.wav|63|His is a global perspective.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_188.wav|46|The boat was fully equipped with safety equipment.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_092.wav|73|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_338.wav|54|When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_324.wav|39|I could not have hoped to run at this level.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_017.wav|36|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_145.wav|47|She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_333.wav|15|It's not going to last five minutes.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_159.wav|22|The death toll included five children.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_005.wav|33|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_379.wav|97|It's a hidden problem.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_239.wav|99|It is no surprise.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_013.wav|97|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_249.wav|52|My first New Year's wish is for him to change his mind.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_088.wav|96|Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_190.wav|9|However, this idea is never developed.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_336.wav|43|It is a time bomb.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_205.wav|106|Millions of British jobs depend on Europe.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_044.wav|6|It is the strength of the school.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_098.wav|42|My wife and family are the support system.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_342.wav|92|I believe in public services.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_388.wav|50|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_415.wav|72|Parliament was evenly divided on the issue.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_183.wav|89|Our team is just so young.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_305.wav|104|If that is the case, it is a breakthrough.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_065.wav|62|All were later allowed home.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_330.wav|45|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_310.wav|8|Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_242.wav|76|I tried to push him away.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_048.wav|5|There is no reason at all.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_404.wav|17|We were close, but not close enough.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_209.wav|98|The claim was denied by the first minister.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_316.wav|65|This is extremely positive news.)
DUMMY2/p244/p244_036.wav|78|This is a central issue.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_227.wav|60|So it was at Easter Road.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_379.wav|84|Yet the data is compelling.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_200.wav|99|The service from the other players was super.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_419.wav|75|They were not complacent in any way.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_083.wav|66|In the meantime, he added, prevention was the key.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_172.wav|67|I will tell you.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_088.wav|4|I have hardly any commitments.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_189.wav|28|The fund has three elements.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_149.wav|82|That's a huge amount.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_286.wav|17|Is he any good in the kitchen?
DUMMY2/p262/p262_211.wav|45|I had decided to quit the show.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_074.wav|9|I've not thought about it.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_159.wav|45|As, indeed, they would be.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_147.wav|20|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_153.wav|44|I felt really good until Friday.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_203.wav|49|That is a brand name.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_221.wav|34|He was married with a young child.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_237.wav|43|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_088.wav|103|He just wants to play.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_393.wav|68|There will always be someone, somewhere, willing to undercut on price.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_373.wav|50|They were to blame for the first two goals.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_125.wav|71|"Well, you can have a tree."
DUMMY2/p247/p247_413.wav|14|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?)
DUMMY2/p243/p243_311.wav|53|He is keen to stay in public service.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_329.wav|61|I am so upset.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_142.wav|68|It was tough, but we did have a lot of possession.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_367.wav|28|We're not travel agents.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_390.wav|28|Wrong decisions Address in full
DUMMY2/p276/p276_303.wav|106|Harrowing is easy, after all.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_162.wav|4|But no, it's not funny.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_076.wav|13|There were no proposals on the table.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_357.wav|64|No, it's actually in a block of flats.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_388.wav|4|That argument has been won.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_221.wav|5|I'd never seen a play about me.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_314.wav|32|His appeal is instantly understood.)
DUMMY2/p343/p343_175.wav|21|It is, though the law is not clear cut.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_319.wav|27|Henman has been warned.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_160.wav|18|He would have done the same to me.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_222.wav|18|We will all suffer as a result.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_141.wav|24|That first victory made a huge difference to my career.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_109.wav|2|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_436.wav|32|No doubt the council would welcome the proposal.)
DUMMY2/p250/p250_137.wav|24|She's got to say something.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_073.wav|49|Seven people were later detained by police.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_182.wav|19|From now on there is no hiding place.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_061.wav|76|The firm was down and almost out.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_371.wav|77|We knew he was very creative.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_322.wav|105|You feel the pride.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_318.wav|103|The woman is basically off her head.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_344.wav|84|His contract was then not renewed.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_139.wav|12|From then on, Scott has never looked back.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_158.wav|50|It is not like us.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_270.wav|30|The outstanding issues are still there.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_357.wav|47|He's very explosive.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_339.wav|8|My body is clearly capable.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_242.wav|101|The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_059.wav|15|With him are the symbols of his faith.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_206.wav|68|Most of them were one-year conscripts.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_383.wav|21|And there is another problem.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_376.wav|39|Like his acting, it was an accident.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_059.wav|33|Hopefully, they will not go through with it.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_288.wav|67|I felt like I was a child.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_337.wav|85|My son was too young to die.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_181.wav|41|I was totally wrong.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_005.wav|57|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_080.wav|77|It was a total disaster.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_194.wav|13|Only local people are helping.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_185.wav|89|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_217.wav|54|He takes his time, and won't be rushed.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_179.wav|33|Many other areas are coming up.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_008.wav|37|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_050.wav|62|Hopefully, it will be built by next year.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_319.wav|106|I'm interested in interesting work.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_213.wav|35|All will be revealed in due course.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_135.wav|3|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
DUMMY2/p286/p286_335.wav|63|Six other people were injured.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_012.wav|63|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_280.wav|60|The joint bid is still on course.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_061.wav|37|We work for the athlete.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_102.wav|106|Robin Williams is very subdued.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_027.wav|2|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_121.wav|62|For me, it was a shattering experience.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_167.wav|42|They would never let him go.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_343.wav|35|There was some merit in that.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_174.wav|85|But the foundations have been laid.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_305.wav|68|His arguments were supported by Mr Bevan.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_043.wav|31|People were determined to change the Government in the last election.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_281.wav|66|The manager knew me very well.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_330.wav|44|The Government, however, insists the company is not for sale.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_036.wav|19|The waiting is over, well almost.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_373.wav|37|But you never won any games.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_267.wav|106|The tribunal said his conduct was wholly reprehensible.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_225.wav|83|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_302.wav|24|It was an easy decision to come here.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_364.wav|91|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_341.wav|5|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_355.wav|62|He, too, is killing.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_081.wav|52|I do not attempt to answer that.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_049.wav|28|His art was not just about emotions.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_326.wav|25|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_371.wav|75|The pair are very much in love.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_496.wav|24|Subsidy income will not be affected.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_453.wav|8|They were good years for him.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_295.wav|22|Broomfield was the centre of the town.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_254.wav|79|It came in bits and pieces.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_296.wav|77|Size is not the issue.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_411.wav|8|That is the ultimate revenge.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_060.wav|65|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?)
DUMMY2/p292/p292_213.wav|13|We were extremely arrogant.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_368.wav|63|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_369.wav|8|He was then replaced by Ross.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_325.wav|64|After his birthday, Scott was very upset.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_047.wav|37|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_262.wav|18|He will go on the bench.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_321.wav|66|No-one, however, was complacent about the size of the task.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_160.wav|67|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_056.wav|96|Because we do not need it.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_403.wav|94|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_406.wav|56|Upgrading the station has been under consideration for some time.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_395.wav|40|The prison has been affected by unrest in the past.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_014.wav|34|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_421.wav|106|Civic leaders yesterday praised the good behaviour of revellers across the country.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_215.wav|29|Who was she ?
DUMMY2/p255/p255_001.wav|31|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_086.wav|75|It was a big departure.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_112.wav|77|Then again, we could have.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_041.wav|99|She is believed to be in South Africa.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_104.wav|64|Safety was also an issue.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_310.wav|102|There are no easy solutions to this problem.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_358.wav|2|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_117.wav|40|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_303.wav|0|Well, he can do it.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_133.wav|44|He loved his job and working in newspapers.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_109.wav|39|You are like an animal.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_420.wav|75|They did the right thing.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_197.wav|79|It has been well worth it.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_186.wav|47|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_368.wav|70|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_189.wav|102|It was located on the remote control.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_316.wav|72|David Trimble has sold out.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_035.wav|71|"And we have a singer."
DUMMY2/p234/p234_021.wav|3|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_286.wav|10|I'd like to report a murder.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_414.wav|95|I was shaking on the blocks.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_256.wav|102|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_122.wav|100|I was on a roll.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_030.wav|56|It is a tough game but we have a chance.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_266.wav|81|We're in shock.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_422.wav|13|We didn't get any from his face.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_283.wav|81|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_240.wav|26|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_310.wav|56|I thought his speech was a disgrace.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_312.wav|31|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_354.wav|27|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_148.wav|77|I am a good player.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_359.wav|10|In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_097.wav|40|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_173.wav|96|It became a book by itself.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_111.wav|61|It's in his blood.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_207.wav|63|Who was she ?
DUMMY2/p295/p295_068.wav|92|I really couldn't believe it had actually happened.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_314.wav|75|The answer is with ourselves.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_291.wav|54|I love the tradition of vaudeville.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_059.wav|83|My fitness was very poor.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_187.wav|21|Next league matches, Motherwell - Dundee United.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_088.wav|107|We're just a family working hard, working seven days a week.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_223.wav|56|They would have to go to the Royal.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_147.wav|94|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_349.wav|54|I hope my successor will do the same.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_068.wav|77|Now the plot is perfect.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_262.wav|98|Sub Not Used, McCormick.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_358.wav|16|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_263.wav|51|Who would have thought it?
DUMMY2/p234/p234_227.wav|3|However, he said the money had not been wasted.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_143.wav|84|Is that it ?
DUMMY2/p294/p294_164.wav|104|He also admitted.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_315.wav|81|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_077.wav|57|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_120.wav|90|It is rubbish.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_220.wav|5|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_243.wav|27|Three weeks later, he resigned.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_190.wav|92|He added,  It is all about the search for power.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_154.wav|106|But they must believe in themselves.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_353.wav|32|Either team will be hard.)
DUMMY2/p252/p252_039.wav|55|Everyone has to prove a point when they cross that white line.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_255.wav|23|In short, the club was broke.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_143.wav|14|I have accepted the challenge.)
DUMMY2/p225/p225_236.wav|101|That will be the criteria for the future.

DUMMY2/p310/p310_120.wav|17|I bought a car at auction.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_381.wav|107|That is not just my personal view.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_118.wav|46|Faces from the Eighties.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_413.wav|22|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_369.wav|89|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_002.wav|25|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_085.wav|51|Does it work, is it safe, and is it right?
DUMMY2/p335/p335_139.wav|49|It was a moment of madness.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_284.wav|16|Maloney is an engaging talent.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_424.wav|63|It was important to win the singles.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_215.wav|33|I have had a lovely summer.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_097.wav|42|I was doing well at the hustings.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_184.wav|8|For example, I supported the government on Afghanistan and Kosovo.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_111.wav|99|We do not expect any surplus.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_249.wav|107|It means they actually control the programme.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_199.wav|68|The pressure is on President Bush to deliver.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_378.wav|74|What's in a name?
DUMMY2/p267/p267_016.wav|0|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_127.wav|41|Does this mean.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_073.wav|63|That would be too easy.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_261.wav|33|That is very important to people.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_125.wav|77|The money needs to go to the front line.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_029.wav|56|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_067.wav|76|Sandy was very active.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_260.wav|81|I am just trying to do my job.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_226.wav|0|What are you not good at ?
DUMMY2/p226/p226_284.wav|43|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_239.wav|48|This is absolutely not true.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_035.wav|66|I am proud of moments like that.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_261.wav|37|They should stop the bombing.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_344.wav|14|What are they for ?)
DUMMY2/p245/p245_090.wav|59|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_031.wav|82|It's an amazing landscape!
DUMMY2/p300/p300_100.wav|102|My office is bare.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_062.wav|90|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_046.wav|1|They said we were out of touch.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_178.wav|38|What do they do, anyway?
DUMMY2/p278/p278_152.wav|10|The point is raised again that evening at the Assembly Rooms.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_169.wav|92|That's probably the hard bit about being dropped.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_048.wav|49|On reflection, it is more than that.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_213.wav|1|There is certainly no single outstanding candidate.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_294.wav|91|Do you come from Moscow?
DUMMY2/p244/p244_234.wav|78|It will be decided in the next month.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_250.wav|42|That is how it will be judged.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_298.wav|47|I thought it was my only chance.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_064.wav|55|Our people are ready.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_381.wav|89|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_170.wav|62|A number of people could not speak English.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_394.wav|21|Which he is, too.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_058.wav|23|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_362.wav|99|Now, though, he has an incentive.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_327.wav|41|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_272.wav|50|This news came after the stock market closed on Monday.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_325.wav|8|People can really get themselves in a mess.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_093.wav|34|Scotland came very close in the second Test.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_214.wav|96|She should not be blamed.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_002.wav|70|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_103.wav|36|City sentiment is in his favour.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_453.wav|48|It seemed a logical expansion.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_056.wav|68|Several hundred people attended yesterday.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_383.wav|94|They haven't got a hope.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_227.wav|20|They have now become the focus of a huge police inquiry.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_262.wav|19|Every school in Scotland should be excellent.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_171.wav|24|They have not been named.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_299.wav|51|I just want to change my life.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_038.wav|5|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_286.wav|75|Much of the equipment was new.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_243.wav|52|Does the name matter ?
DUMMY2/p314/p314_324.wav|51|I'll tell you honestly.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_313.wav|78|All of the management has invested in the firm.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_214.wav|88|We are seeking a meeting with the Minister.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_022.wav|83|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_278.wav|49|I'm very tired, but it was worth it.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_296.wav|66|They too refused to come out and talk.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_036.wav|80|It was clear.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_307.wav|59|He was solid.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_048.wav|9|As she explains.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_408.wav|27|It might be.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_028.wav|24|Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_233.wav|62|And, also, when he does not have the ball.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_087.wav|28|I couldn't believe it, but it looks like it's true.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_265.wav|48|They could not match it.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_405.wav|89|It is an absolute nonsense.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_404.wav|8|He put some colour into Scottish history.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_168.wav|58|Nobody even knew it had happened.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_190.wav|59|Now, it's all right.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_233.wav|10|IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_099.wav|104|So is that it, then?
DUMMY2/p316/p316_324.wav|85|It has to reinvent itself.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_292.wav|1|Twaddle is a case in point.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_156.wav|47|We knew we had the goal we wanted.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_363.wav|1|It is the way they work.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_165.wav|96|Again, we were lucky.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_106.wav|10|We needed financial backing to get it off the ground.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_355.wav|17|Now it is measuring it in dollars.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_391.wav|18|We'll have to be satisfied with it.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_065.wav|107|It is just part of modern day life.
