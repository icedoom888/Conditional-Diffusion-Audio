DUMMY2/p347/p347_252.wav|46|There are a few changes.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_144.wav|80|He is severe.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_239.wav|36|That has been the easy part.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_136.wav|100|She died at her home.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_262.wav|14|Either way, the investor retains the premium.)
DUMMY2/p302/p302_206.wav|30|He now describes himself as Scottish Labour.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_233.wav|37|Others may have, but I'm a fighter.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_339.wav|11|And that's good news for the magpies.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_317.wav|52|He will just go on doing his job.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_134.wav|61|The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_337.wav|93|It could have gone either way.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_123.wav|66|The lady is right.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_052.wav|46|My parents are exhausted.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_062.wav|86|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_301.wav|81|Nothing is safe.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_397.wav|34|Of course he does!
DUMMY2/p360/p360_348.wav|60|Our position is extremely simple.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_129.wav|49|A win was a real achievement.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_114.wav|26|This is the end of a chapter, and it is very sad.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_261.wav|8|You're not getting any goodwill.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_407.wav|96|We should have known.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_218.wav|26|I might come back.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_261.wav|28|I didn't know what he was capable of.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_076.wav|72|But, of course, it isn't.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_278.wav|102|That, however, can only be achieved by constant investment.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_029.wav|14|A shortlist is to be drawn up next month.)
DUMMY2/p244/p244_366.wav|78|In fact, it was almost as if it was expected.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_110.wav|48|I can't remember a lot of it.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_210.wav|1|Winning, meanwhile, is headed back to New York City.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_098.wav|9|Two of the team became ill.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_303.wav|13|One was a lawyer.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_149.wav|70|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_006.wav|79|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_336.wav|96|It is difficult to get into the team at the moment.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_073.wav|40|It works for us.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_325.wav|35|I was as strong as a horse.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_276.wav|41|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_017.wav|74|Others have tried to explain this phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_010.wav|20|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_107.wav|41|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_093.wav|70|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_293.wav|47|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_395.wav|23|This is a completely new experience for me.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_073.wav|83|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_088.wav|61|Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_042.wav|68|His charisma is all on the course.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_249.wav|19|We should be rewarded for producing.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_266.wav|17|Broadcasting will be top of the agenda.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_171.wav|32|If that's the case, he will struggle.)
DUMMY2/p241/p241_173.wav|86|One season, they might do well.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_205.wav|15|They should not be blamed for it.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_401.wav|38|And they all had these other commitments.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_269.wav|100|was everything done to save people ?
DUMMY2/p323/p323_152.wav|34|What's it got to do with art?
DUMMY2/p306/p306_226.wav|12|I found a fault and worked at it.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_247.wav|91|He would just say it was terrible.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_273.wav|40|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_130.wav|14|We suffered a lot for seven years.)
DUMMY2/p343/p343_349.wav|21|That had not happened on this occasion.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_318.wav|1|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_090.wav|10|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_016.wav|82|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_166.wav|46|It is true, but it is only part of the issue.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_268.wav|36|That would depend on the parole board.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_199.wav|75|It could be argued that the council was pushed to the brink.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_236.wav|2|Three weeks later, he resigned.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_286.wav|80|The Government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_056.wav|27|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_254.wav|66|Sub Not Used, McKay.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_350.wav|67|I'm very lucky.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_292.wav|8|You have to expect this type of thing.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_418.wav|105|They said so that I would look good in uniform.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_101.wav|91|But his attendance is not guaranteed.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_387.wav|26|That's the name of the game, though.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_360.wav|102|She looked very, very poor.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_243.wav|82|There is a handful of rewarding paintings.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_149.wav|69|It is not just about pay.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_216.wav|53|I am not going to judge them.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_201.wav|94|He has a lot of experience as captain in his career.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_164.wav|93|However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_257.wav|106|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_441.wav|89|The shift in public perception about the disease is amazing.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_008.wav|5|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_347.wav|16|I'm very lucky.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_157.wav|71|"Alain Baxter did not have long to speak on Friday."
DUMMY2/p227/p227_097.wav|29|The following are the principal provisions.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_210.wav|28|River City is a showcase for Scottish talent.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_318.wav|82|As far as Scotland is concerned, he should relax.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_399.wav|2|Is that possible?
DUMMY2/p243/p243_281.wav|53|Analysts believed the market would welcome the group's plan.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_132.wav|16|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_250.wav|89|They must play for each other.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_077.wav|20|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_161.wav|87|Athletics is on a roll in the country.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_244.wav|47|Jock Brown is appointed as general manager.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_026.wav|76|It is never an easy game.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_207.wav|73|Because they didn't want to know.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_416.wav|14|George is on a two-day visit to Scotland.)
DUMMY2/p285/p285_285.wav|2|Who did the recruiting?
DUMMY2/p245/p245_304.wav|59|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_343.wav|31|That is the very reason why it was so vital.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_007.wav|16|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_420.wav|76|Who can tell?
DUMMY2/p262/p262_391.wav|45|This is a major step forward for carers.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_031.wav|49|It's about bringing people in, breaking down barriers.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_061.wav|104|I think we'll just keep it.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_138.wav|80|Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_268.wav|30|Harrowing is easy, after all.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_044.wav|61|It's the only thing.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_300.wav|57|We want to play at the worlds.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_209.wav|53|They are a victim of their own success.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_271.wav|20|We're in shock.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_167.wav|46|It's going to be epic.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_278.wav|45|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_403.wav|70|went on sale.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_344.wav|93|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_283.wav|102|I'm going to help out in the summer, as producer.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_071.wav|76|There were no formal announcements.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_390.wav|72|Changes need to be made.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_071.wav|86|He highlighted a lack of staff.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_112.wav|13|They were back in favour with the SAC.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_495.wav|75|The Prime Minister has been in touch.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_032.wav|30|He's not very big, either.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_007.wav|37|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_151.wav|65|Does that put pressure on us?)
DUMMY2/p225/p225_020.wav|101|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_019.wav|101|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_350.wav|19|I shall be voting Yes to support him.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_107.wav|11|We're all paying for it.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_128.wav|9|Well, you can have a tree.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_235.wav|49|This is a big step up.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_045.wav|34|The first was excluding Sinn Fein.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_362.wav|40|The death rates are still as high.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_012.wav|41|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_087.wav|70|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_413.wav|100|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_136.wav|6|But it's a subtle process.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_092.wav|100|It was clear on Thursday.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_189.wav|39|The region is open for business.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_082.wav|90|This is the way things should be handled.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_181.wav|36|If that's the case, he will struggle.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_230.wav|92|This will help our confidence.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_388.wav|70|I'm glad I came.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_111.wav|23|Look at his last couple of records.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_211.wav|96|Feel the heat ?
DUMMY2/p335/p335_137.wav|49|I am prepared to help make it happen.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_252.wav|64|Who will provide the wine?
DUMMY2/p273/p273_127.wav|56|I love the spectacle of cinema.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_314.wav|65|Hibs are playing with style now.)
DUMMY2/p272/p272_075.wav|69|There was an e-mail.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_229.wav|11|That is bad enough.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_071.wav|78|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_364.wav|57|It is a simple equation.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_415.wav|75|I've got my own ideas.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_087.wav|14|I've had it for the exams.)
DUMMY2/p272/p272_390.wav|69|It's like a basketball.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_203.wav|44|You can be sure we will have problems.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_192.wav|91|That, though, was again according to manager McCall.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_117.wav|84|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_002.wav|81|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_136.wav|102|All our thoughts and prayers are with them.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_081.wav|58|You can't keep them separate.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_148.wav|2|I was on a roll.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_271.wav|93|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_248.wav|82|It is not surprising, but it is appaling.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_140.wav|18|My ambition is to make the cut.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_058.wav|104|Freedom from Serbia is a growing objective.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_351.wav|24|It was tough to contain the excitement.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_039.wav|25|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_239.wav|94|The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_254.wav|54|I still feel like a wee boy.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_343.wav|66|He also was in debt to drug dealers.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_206.wav|72|Their moment had come, or so they said.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_193.wav|102|You look at them and you understand.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_102.wav|104|It's too close to call.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_043.wav|14|Among them are many criminals.)
DUMMY2/p341/p341_149.wav|66|I had a tie in my hand.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_344.wav|91|We were lucky to have survived.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_374.wav|49|Six other people were injured.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_452.wav|106|They can now see the rewards for working hard at the game.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_002.wav|37|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_089.wav|82|I believe that so strongly.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_251.wav|50|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_038.wav|34|And this perception might find an unlikely supporter.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_131.wav|25|Well, you can have a tree.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_024.wav|67|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_091.wav|85|There was no bad behaviour.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_208.wav|72|Some examples are presented in detail.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_159.wav|3|Not that the occasion was without restraint.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_351.wav|87|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_128.wav|81|No production was achieved.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_377.wav|7|An alternative must be offered.)
DUMMY2/p360/p360_188.wav|60|Only one person can claim the credit.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_295.wav|56|What was the matter for concern ?
DUMMY2/p272/p272_335.wav|69|He loves the big occasions.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_313.wav|92|I think they are right to be impatient.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_117.wav|20|It was the eighties.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_215.wav|68|WHAT's in a name is this, the age of the Internet?
DUMMY2/p288/p288_198.wav|47|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_355.wav|84|It is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_296.wav|49|I'd never be free.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_293.wav|48|This is a good incentive for both parties to conclude.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_352.wav|72|There is room for me.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_136.wav|107|Do you think they would do any better?
DUMMY2/p310/p310_194.wav|17|I just had so much fun.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_277.wav|13|Dialogue is the key.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_263.wav|44|We've had great things in the past.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_081.wav|20|He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_278.wav|73|It was a virus.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_185.wav|12|I am writing a novel.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_389.wav|76|That time is not far away.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_018.wav|67|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_157.wav|29|Adams is surely worth a chance.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_030.wav|57|Life was like a timetable.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_066.wav|70|This is the first step.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_374.wav|96|The group is due to publish its report in the autumn.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_394.wav|68|However, in October another partnership was announced.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_212.wav|28|His style is suited to Scottish football.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_161.wav|31|It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_154.wav|14|how do you get it back ?)
DUMMY2/p361/p361_258.wav|79|He will appear in court today.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_081.wav|97|I'm so proud of my team.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_018.wav|46|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_403.wav|72|Just get on with your job.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_064.wav|33|The devil is in the detail.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_393.wav|27|He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_386.wav|60|They are with their father.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_203.wav|42|The home team also had their moments.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_067.wav|44|Most people know that.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_319.wav|64|I was doing well at the hustings.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_352.wav|4|His behaviour today has been disgusting.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_202.wav|7|It had little effect on European equity markets.)
DUMMY2/p243/p243_014.wav|53|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_116.wav|42|Obviously, Airbus is one of these.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_077.wav|53|I'd sign back up tomorrow if he was back on board.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_027.wav|7|Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.)
DUMMY2/p323/p323_161.wav|34|That is our unfinished business.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_261.wav|98|All the children on the roll are genuine.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_212.wav|25|The aim is to have the reports online by this autumn.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_136.wav|71|"Nobody in the world can get away from him."
DUMMY2/p264/p264_092.wav|65|However this weekend it will be different.)
DUMMY2/p281/p281_038.wav|36|It is a financial matter.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_325.wav|103|Pressure of work is no excuse.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_077.wav|1|The problem is Labour.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_344.wav|94|The boat was fantastic.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_199.wav|89|We have an election in eight days.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_070.wav|34|They are not the answer to staff shortages.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_275.wav|6|Now we have had enough.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_018.wav|7|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. )
DUMMY2/p258/p258_118.wav|26|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_332.wav|107|It is time to fight a decisive battle.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_318.wav|92|It's an hour of the same response.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_086.wav|18|It will probably be my last, too.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_162.wav|104|Such as it is.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_463.wav|95|This morning I got a call from my wife.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_196.wav|67|Four policemen were wounded.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_068.wav|51|I've learned a lot, and tomorrow is another day.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_014.wav|16|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_316.wav|3|This is a major property in Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_092.wav|101|There is a contract in existence for Allan.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_159.wav|107|It's my favourite place to hang out.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_245.wav|29|It is the voice of the survivors.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_033.wav|40|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_264.wav|24|He is a reporter for us.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_308.wav|31|It's certainly different.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_313.wav|61|They were on holiday in Egypt.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_048.wav|46|The Old Firm are going nowhere.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_254.wav|67|It was a hit.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_070.wav|49|On that basis, he would set it aside.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_371.wav|78|I have a good feeling about this.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_357.wav|97|The other was the tabloids.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_344.wav|18|They have to be dealt with.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_065.wav|77|This is a big step up.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_349.wav|8|Nobody said it was required.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_146.wav|29|Like the others, he was arrested.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_308.wav|68|He moved back to Edinburgh, where he lived with his mother.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_184.wav|68|Lifeboat is at the Tron Theatre, Glasgow, tonight.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_315.wav|100|We would hope to make progress on that next year.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_212.wav|94|Feel the heat?
DUMMY2/p341/p341_106.wav|66|The website is now being amended.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_333.wav|39|The minister is the engineer.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_139.wav|50|Put yourself in the position of being a referee.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_319.wav|103|The pressure was now back on Mr Arafat.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_140.wav|21|That was a good effort.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_159.wav|53|As our national coach, Brown is done for.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_120.wav|104|My father and mother are.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_408.wav|107|He was dead on arrival at hospital.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_184.wav|13|We didn't think anything would happen.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_376.wav|92|A spokesman refused to confirm the figure.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_199.wav|7|We represent a wide range of society.)
DUMMY2/p273/p273_376.wav|56|It was like a weekly wage.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_190.wav|56|The early physical reports were clear.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_106.wav|103|The news was yesterday welcomed by union leaders.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_231.wav|106|I've been asked that already, this morning - on the radio.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_169.wav|88|I hope that doesn't happen.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_001.wav|26|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_335.wav|9|There was no time scale.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_240.wav|98|There is no other way.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_323.wav|29|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_140.wav|83|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_284.wav|77|And Michael was just great.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_142.wav|50|It only increased the support for him.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_074.wav|55|Insurance will perhaps reduce.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_143.wav|104|It's hard not to.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_036.wav|51|But she was very human.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_076.wav|24|I was as strong as a horse.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_363.wav|78|At first, the youngster was not keen.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_305.wav|62|It is good to look back.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_031.wav|99|Because it's a waste of time for both sides.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_127.wav|25|I'm so angry.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_329.wav|95|So what happens next ?
DUMMY2/p285/p285_257.wav|2|Is that a serious question?
DUMMY2/p295/p295_105.wav|92|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_150.wav|59|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_292.wav|75|She failed in her action.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_211.wav|60|We should have no more problems.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_198.wav|8|I know every village and island on the west coast.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_331.wav|26|I am so upset.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_270.wav|62|He finished the night in a cell.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_249.wav|86|This is the culture change in medicine.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_290.wav|26|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_442.wav|8|It deserved to be a winner.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_424.wav|78|But it was a struggle.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_057.wav|29|So is that it, then ?
DUMMY2/p306/p306_091.wav|12|He then had a swipe at Hearts.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_151.wav|100|But I am still awaiting an answer.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_376.wav|103|However, there you have it, success has eluded them so far.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_392.wav|94|In Scotland, we keep the faith.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_493.wav|48|I first met him last summer.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_275.wav|36|That should be the subject matter of a public debate.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_059.wav|69|Here's a clue.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_161.wav|98|I have no battle with the Scots.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_028.wav|87|Wages and salaries account for a major proportion of our expenses.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_231.wav|39|I'm just a regular person.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_243.wav|87|We will turn the corner.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_049.wav|0|They just thought it was extremely good acting.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_392.wav|2|He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_139.wav|11|How much of a cop out is that?
DUMMY2/p286/p286_427.wav|63|No date has been fixed for his return.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_283.wav|40|Yet, it worked.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_395.wav|56|After the match, do you ?
DUMMY2/p339/p339_364.wav|18|Sadly, so did a couple of errors.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_041.wav|61|He did not know his daughter.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_080.wav|43|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_028.wav|36|Smoking is also very important.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_316.wav|13|We are on a four-year mission.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_219.wav|102|I might get an injury very easily.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_004.wav|70|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_209.wav|93|We have an election in eight days.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_311.wav|65|The board would report to the Scottish Parliament.)
DUMMY2/p244/p244_088.wav|78|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_080.wav|63|England were ahead until two minutes into injury time.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_271.wav|30|Inclusion and Autism, Is It Working?
DUMMY2/p298/p298_034.wav|68|The crackdown is launched today by the government.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_007.wav|35|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_453.wav|89|Stewart was the life and soul of the party.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_241.wav|27|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_229.wav|55|Three hit the target.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_369.wav|34|They were behind the wheel.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_194.wav|67|It is minute.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_151.wav|66|Sean Connery did not disappoint.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_079.wav|2|Someone who cares
DUMMY2/p276/p276_064.wav|106|He looks like an Afghan.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_370.wav|4|So he was anxious to try something new.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_052.wav|3|I was released after six days.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_313.wav|46|Councillor Gordon has refused to stand down.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_182.wav|73|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_198.wav|56|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_298.wav|38|People are fed up.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_044.wav|57|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_270.wav|81|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_344.wav|13|The boat was fantastic.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_130.wav|83|No production was achieved.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_277.wav|75|We run within the law.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_097.wav|25|Until you hit the big games.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_289.wav|52|We played well at Aberdeen, though we lost.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_159.wav|11|But every two minutes it was exploding.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_305.wav|19|SO now we know the secret.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_220.wav|69|They must do it.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_434.wav|75|But you can go beyond that condition.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_194.wav|60|But it won't make a difference.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_367.wav|89|It was a funny game.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_305.wav|27|This is a war over our home.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_227.wav|31|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_024.wav|73|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_265.wav|33|There he goes again.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_243.wav|26|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_076.wav|30|You do have a way out.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_017.wav|19|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_096.wav|102|He told us about it the next day.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_372.wav|25|Stevenson was arrested on Monday morning.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_377.wav|37|The most important thing in theatre is to listen.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_165.wav|10|We have a budget in March.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_017.wav|12|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_247.wav|99|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_189.wav|49|Do you come from Moscow?
DUMMY2/p335/p335_124.wav|49|The plane was in flames
DUMMY2/p272/p272_137.wav|69|Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_375.wav|85|It is a flexible concept.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_345.wav|35|The airport was even different.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_131.wav|7|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.)
DUMMY2/p347/p347_244.wav|46|He's in with the furniture.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_081.wav|46|All of us do.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_208.wav|49|We don't say there was a massacre.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_391.wav|56|Is it worth it ?
DUMMY2/p249/p249_253.wav|80|At the end of the day, one has to be careful.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_087.wav|40|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_298.wav|62|Bill is a mentor.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_128.wav|87|Their season has been consigned to history.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_322.wav|104|She was married with one son.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_362.wav|37|It was a good workout.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_182.wav|86|They will run a mile.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_346.wav|53|It was a bit like having children.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_057.wav|48|I feel we might now have the foundations to go forward.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_162.wav|88|I don't know where it went.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_127.wav|14|I can't even get into the A team.)
DUMMY2/p302/p302_249.wav|30|It means they actually control the programme.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_039.wav|77|But it might have done.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_485.wav|24|And rugby fans can help.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_164.wav|54|Scotland need to work on two key areas.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_211.wav|58|The outcome is now in our own hands.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_005.wav|12|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_050.wav|10|I have learned from him.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_094.wav|7|Collaboration is also encouraged by the Medical Research Council and other bodies.)
DUMMY2/p317/p317_025.wav|97|They have the cash to do that.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_242.wav|27|It's quite nice.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_159.wav|65|Sport is good for you.)
DUMMY2/p232/p232_080.wav|96|I've got the shirt.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_094.wav|58|He put some colour into Scottish history.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_447.wav|36|I was embarrassed by it.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_090.wav|26|The selection process is still at a very early stage.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_177.wav|89|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_165.wav|63|We will turn the corner.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_071.wav|45|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_202.wav|86|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_184.wav|45|Miller was every bit as happy.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_166.wav|14|It has become a way of life.)
DUMMY2/p276/p276_396.wav|106|He is obviously very dangerous.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_262.wav|33|I certainly hope not.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_084.wav|89|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_195.wav|106|The protest will go ahead as planned.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_198.wav|85|There must be boundaries.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_019.wav|65|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. )
DUMMY2/p279/p279_045.wav|25|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_085.wav|98|I don't think it is.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_130.wav|50|It plans to return to this field.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_356.wav|106|There is no quick fix.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_052.wav|68|Who said impatience is a virtue?
DUMMY2/p268/p268_387.wav|87|I have received no explanation.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_025.wav|107|It does make a big difference.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_119.wav|56|My life has changed a lot.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_150.wav|78|There were no grounds for his action.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_054.wav|32|There's still plenty time left.)
DUMMY2/p265/p265_260.wav|73|This is a question of Islam.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_422.wav|77|He's had to suffer for the last six years.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_362.wav|6|The work with Alison was a great experience.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_248.wav|13|My life has been turned upside down.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_015.wav|7|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. )
DUMMY2/p243/p243_108.wav|53|It took around three minutes from beginning to end.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_309.wav|83|She is very distinctive.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_419.wav|60|I don't think they are too serious.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_275.wav|93|And Michael was just great.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_275.wav|3|The statement contained no surprises.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_362.wav|105|He denied the charge.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_291.wav|6|It being the weekend, there was no-one there.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_027.wav|41|They may be wrong.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_153.wav|5|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_112.wav|30|She will also get a pay rise.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_099.wav|68|Their vision was not impeded.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_412.wav|100|The breakdown was much later in her life.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_323.wav|32|Do they think anyone else wants them ?)
DUMMY2/p285/p285_192.wav|2|It caused a lot of upset.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_097.wav|81|I am extremely sad.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_389.wav|65|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.)
DUMMY2/p239/p239_490.wav|48|They cannot operate without a licence from the local authority.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_388.wav|74|Scotland has lost a great religious leader.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_154.wav|84|Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_251.wav|37|And they were being paid ?
DUMMY2/p364/p364_017.wav|88|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_065.wav|69|They are ready.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_330.wav|20|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_194.wav|53|Murray spent the early part of his career elsewhere.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_191.wav|31|There is no point in looking any further.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_199.wav|93|There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_067.wav|27|It's good news and long overdue.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_386.wav|41|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_135.wav|14|It is the latter which has prompted the warning.)
DUMMY2/p341/p341_331.wav|66|Tax is a matter for national governments.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_399.wav|41|Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_031.wav|35|I'm so happy that she did.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_028.wav|98|This is a very interesting move.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_317.wav|81|The Premier League has been a huge success.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_169.wav|43|Nobody did in those days.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_421.wav|36|Footballers have also been targeted.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_158.wav|81|Was this element always there?
DUMMY2/p288/p288_306.wav|47|It's just not funny!
DUMMY2/p351/p351_418.wav|33|It was visibly on fire.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_160.wav|5|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_153.wav|49|There was a lot of resentment.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_089.wav|99|They lived for their children.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_102.wav|49|This would not be my first choice.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_289.wav|85|He knows what he's got to do.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_133.wav|35|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_305.wav|9|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
DUMMY2/p313/p313_245.wav|76|The truth is otherwise.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_163.wav|22|This is a United Kingdom.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_084.wav|65|Maybe they will see sense.)
DUMMY2/p299/p299_247.wav|58|The Real IRA was blamed for the blast.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_024.wav|43|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_055.wav|96|It's very odd.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_086.wav|98|There are no other contenders.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_306.wav|49|If not, he should go home.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_284.wav|103|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_003.wav|43|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_207.wav|19|There are moments of honesty, too.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_214.wav|36|He had suffered a heart attack.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_131.wav|75|We will try to find someone.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_034.wav|58|This is a totally different order of agreement.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_293.wav|5|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_052.wav|44|Who said impatience is a virtue?
DUMMY2/p283/p283_079.wav|95|It is very special for me.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_142.wav|34|They would love to do more films.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_042.wav|60|I have no intention of resigning today.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_129.wav|98|Everyone in front of me was dead.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_180.wav|21|The talking cannot go on too long.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_342.wav|102|What kind of person is he?
DUMMY2/p333/p333_036.wav|64|It's a policy which has worked for us.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_085.wav|12|Another suggestion was dismissed by Virgin.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_336.wav|49|We will be stronger in Berlin.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_353.wav|13|Glasgow is about to enter a new era.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_318.wav|48|The result is utterly compelling.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_292.wav|89|Nothing is safe.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_231.wav|26|Jim Leighton will play in the Scottish Cup final.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_102.wav|22|I am sure all schools would accept that.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_215.wav|28|My view has now completely changed.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_379.wav|91|It's being very carefully looked at.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_134.wav|88|I love a clever reader.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_074.wav|53|But two groups refused to sign up.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_067.wav|55|Some of their players seemed almost dead.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_359.wav|32|We have very limited capacity.)
DUMMY2/p294/p294_082.wav|104|It was like a vacuum.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_243.wav|56|Does the name matter ?
DUMMY2/p250/p250_297.wav|24|We would have no control over the threshold for repayment.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_051.wav|40|I had come back from London.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_206.wav|0|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_302.wav|67|Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_145.wav|102|Headteachers want their pupils to conform.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_371.wav|11|Sport is good for you.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_359.wav|2|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_133.wav|17|We don't see it as downgrading.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_307.wav|103|A play is a set of actions.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_142.wav|98|This is the man who provides the hope.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_295.wav|80|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_229.wav|72|But he insisted that victory was possible.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_134.wav|93|It is also well received.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_137.wav|53|The Chancellor will deal from a position of strength.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_262.wav|51|Asylum seekers are still being attacked and abused.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_196.wav|7|It shows the strength of the roots.)
DUMMY2/p326/p326_042.wav|28|We just love to chat.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_312.wav|64|He will make an excellent chief inspector.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_183.wav|87|The hearing was due to continue today.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_335.wav|67|He told the court.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_021.wav|68|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_294.wav|17|Then followed a bout of flu.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_153.wav|74|It really is tremendous.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_175.wav|11|It is the manager's decision.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_153.wav|2|My Dad is a hero.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_276.wav|52|Despite Labour's recent problems, it has not been able to do that.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_328.wav|11|This could be a recipe for conflict.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_099.wav|74|We deserved to win it.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_129.wav|86|Some of the characters will not be played by humans.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_393.wav|17|We always thought it should be digital, and cheap.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_190.wav|106|As if that is an achievement.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_325.wav|4|Not because they want to sing about something.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_095.wav|56|We intend to change the model.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_036.wav|0|A week is a long time in politics.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_059.wav|1|Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_154.wav|54|Health care workers and labourers followed.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_151.wav|74|Annika is very, very fit.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_185.wav|1|The election is total confusion and chaos.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_405.wav|54|The surprise is its product is so poor.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_415.wav|48|Autumn is the time of fulfilment.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_143.wav|66|I love you so very much.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_143.wav|99|It's a crucial award.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_266.wav|84|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_393.wav|24|One-third of the places are already taken.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_207.wav|56|I am considered a teenager.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_151.wav|106|Was it the wife ?
DUMMY2/p258/p258_142.wav|26|It opens the door to the Champions League.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_249.wav|8|That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_016.wav|77|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_189.wav|62|There is a lot of heroin about.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_034.wav|23|I asked for a picture and she said, No problem.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_170.wav|70|We should do everything at a stroke.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_177.wav|64|I never found my rhythm.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_206.wav|21|I was influenced by all of these things.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_319.wav|5|They had a confession.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_339.wav|80|That is the very reason why it was so vital.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_187.wav|39|Our position remains the same.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_412.wav|76|Yes, it gave me a lot of confidence.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_023.wav|46|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_054.wav|84|We are working on it.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_057.wav|60|It was very full anyway.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_380.wav|62|Barry will be able to handle this.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_025.wav|19|They will be dealt with.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_285.wav|100|We're trying to get rounded performers.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_049.wav|32|We are certainly talking about many millions.)
DUMMY2/p340/p340_321.wav|74|Structural changes will never be enough.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_234.wav|88|It was all over for us then.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_192.wav|87|This is a frightening development.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_023.wav|19|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_249.wav|42|It's like a high school play.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_204.wav|68|Sometimes you get them, sometimes you don't.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_354.wav|106|They make a selective perception process.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_118.wav|63|We needed financial backing to get it off the ground.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_083.wav|29|They lived for their children.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_135.wav|33|My whole family is.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_347.wav|22|I just want to change my life.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_189.wav|40|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_283.wav|18|There is nothing to be gained from that.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_168.wav|66|Look at his last couple of records.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_413.wav|74|The power of religion is so strong.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_219.wav|62|A teacher is, really, about unity.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_387.wav|6|A decision is expected today.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_437.wav|95|But, in fact, the reverse is true.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_204.wav|59|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_040.wav|40|Sadly, it can't.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_232.wav|17|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_236.wav|16|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_306.wav|17|This is not a faceless system.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_334.wav|102|We will be homeless.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_082.wav|19|This does not help.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_063.wav|105|Have a look at our accounts.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_409.wav|107|I have no argument with Scotland.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_013.wav|84|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_076.wav|85|Thirty schools were closed in the Western Isles.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_267.wav|96|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_358.wav|8|My view has now completely changed.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_273.wav|39|The advisers had some discussions but no conclusion was reached.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_072.wav|22|Michael is putting on a brave face.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_388.wav|103|They did not interfere.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_120.wav|96|It is rubbish.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_227.wav|45|The Dow Jones is way up.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_128.wav|80|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_072.wav|47|It can be halted.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_035.wav|82|It is too pretty, it is too small.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_211.wav|53|This is a young squad and we're all supporters.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_307.wav|54|The project is entitled The Composer in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_307.wav|66|The Dow Jones is way up.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_458.wav|89|Scottish public finances emerge from this review enhanced.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_063.wav|93|He will now seek to sell his shares in the club.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_024.wav|58|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_266.wav|25|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_424.wav|75|Young families accounted for a growing share of the trade.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_188.wav|31|It is the whole package.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_251.wav|91|We kept going right to the final whistle.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_288.wav|85|We are not defeated.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_416.wav|85|He was all blackened.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_199.wav|49|There we were on the first tee.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_100.wav|10|So, did she meet him ?
DUMMY2/p326/p326_229.wav|28|We are going to go about our lives.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_230.wav|89|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_190.wav|11|It's a matter of time.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_246.wav|72|He can perform well under pressure.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_014.wav|74|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_280.wav|5|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_229.wav|13|Then there's the problem of sympathy.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_102.wav|54|No details of the talks were given.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_249.wav|73|Chelsea was a great club.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_341.wav|23|He wanted someone young and ambitious.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_125.wav|51|But it will backfire.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_369.wav|103|News of the funding was broadly welcomed yesterday.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_385.wav|78|Everything is in the mix.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_066.wav|49|It probably didn't feel anything, she added.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_255.wav|30|We are satisfied with this outcome.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_218.wav|35|Basically, they have to come up with the offer.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_034.wav|75|He works at the airport.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_215.wav|37|In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_109.wav|58|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_346.wav|79|It was his own decision.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_206.wav|81|It's not ideal.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_365.wav|55|Analysts welcomed the news.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_341.wav|76|The picture is the same across Scotland.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_094.wav|42|Broomfield was the centre of the town.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_416.wav|104|England could not take anything for granted, however.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_275.wav|74|The scheme has been funded by the Government.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_395.wav|4|Nobody can take it away from me.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_144.wav|15|Since then, they have fallen by more than two thirds.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_109.wav|54|They make a selective perception process.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_125.wav|12|Wallace was a prisoner of war.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_201.wav|104|All options are on the table.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_397.wav|105|Our numbers are small.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_274.wav|44|My dad was working in Ayrshire.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_249.wav|28|Too often it is not.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_305.wav|44|His arguments were supported by Mr Bevan.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_176.wav|82|Directing, if you like.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_254.wav|73|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_269.wav|99|Immediate action must be taken.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_240.wav|101|We are in the hat.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_363.wav|23|She is believed to be in South Africa.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_154.wav|40|So I got a blood test.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_362.wav|14|In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.)
DUMMY2/p298/p298_132.wav|68|They should take their mobile phones.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_020.wav|6|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_225.wav|90|I am immensely sad.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_141.wav|33|We will be victorious.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_060.wav|78|We have got to deliver.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_412.wav|51|It is a natural reaction.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_097.wav|71|"But it was a pleasure."
DUMMY2/p255/p255_201.wav|31|I am totally surprised.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_279.wav|81|You feel very helpless.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_131.wav|96|That first victory made a huge difference to my career.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_143.wav|51|My duty is to win.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_167.wav|94|They are expected to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court today.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_440.wav|65|That approach has passed its sell by date.)
DUMMY2/p267/p267_151.wav|0|Adams is surely worth a chance.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_366.wav|58|It's always nice to play on Centre Court.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_004.wav|78|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_289.wav|39|He was also married with two children.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_100.wav|78|This is a game of confidence.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_384.wav|18|We can make a difference.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_044.wav|96|We will push.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_005.wav|52|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_143.wav|13|These awards will deliver improvements on the ground.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_476.wav|48|Banking stocks were hit hard.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_143.wav|53|It appears that no holiday is complete without a good row.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_309.wav|54|One season, they might do well.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_005.wav|42|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_115.wav|86|He will emerge as a world leader.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_345.wav|3|However, the devil is in the detail.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_139.wav|0|It has to be an event.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_001.wav|67|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_085.wav|29|The latter is due to be finished in February.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_268.wav|104|Detectives are waiting to interview the men.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_098.wav|4|He's got me very well.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_078.wav|69|Painful, but only because it's true.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_462.wav|100|They were totally behind it.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_418.wav|79|It is a result we should savour.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_072.wav|40|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_342.wav|32|That's the way it goes.)
DUMMY2/p314/p314_114.wav|51|His wife Margaret was not in court.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_128.wav|88|This time, it was not be.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_001.wav|93|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_065.wav|44|It is par for the course, isn't it?
DUMMY2/p249/p249_022.wav|80|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_140.wav|79|Only one was from Glasgow.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_213.wav|93|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_334.wav|50|She is now on the back benches.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_102.wav|83|They make a selective perception process.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_035.wav|19|We are doing very well as we are.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_326.wav|73|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_386.wav|19|I can't wait for the outdoors.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_454.wav|8|Let that be their memorial.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_228.wav|69|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_265.wav|30|We always thought it should be digital, and cheap.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_358.wav|36|I said she was very young.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_358.wav|49|Is my wife a racist?
DUMMY2/p341/p341_108.wav|66|I was a bit nervous.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_114.wav|48|It is sometimes like that.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_264.wav|97|It will be an eye for an eye.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_199.wav|98|And it's more subversive.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_112.wav|50|There's still plenty time left.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_237.wav|4|This was an option from the beginning.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_409.wav|17|We had a reunion last week.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_069.wav|36|He had been a singer.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_160.wav|61|Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_078.wav|60|The question was simple enough.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_062.wav|92|If you're going to do it, do it right.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_072.wav|42|It's a depressing, difficult and demanding job.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_425.wav|100|Yet the data is compelling.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_210.wav|11|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_215.wav|45|Work has started.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_252.wav|49|I think he was surprised.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_172.wav|65|I'm taking each day as it comes.)
DUMMY2/p288/p288_282.wav|47|Maloney is an engaging talent.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_089.wav|16|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_205.wav|66|I feel privileged to be here.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_003.wav|106|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_319.wav|79|It was a management problem in the hospital.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_044.wav|27|They said she was stable.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_031.wav|8|Drugs are a serious problem.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_236.wav|13|The first time you read a play.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_384.wav|97|Two years ago, the commission did not want to get involved.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_181.wav|4|That will help my case a bit.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_229.wav|84|You have to do your research.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_409.wav|87|It makes no difference to their friendship.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_175.wav|100|You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_335.wav|78|And it's a goodbye from him.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_043.wav|54|He stands on Centre Court alone.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_256.wav|89|This is a question of Islam.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_372.wav|45|It is a large number.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_335.wav|29|Are they free ?
DUMMY2/p228/p228_205.wav|57|I have a cold.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_327.wav|44|They will want to watch a winning team.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_154.wav|78|She does not want to speak.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_130.wav|104|The lowest increase was recorded in Dundee.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_449.wav|48|Blair also had a penalty.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_195.wav|21|The hotel was huge.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_297.wav|77|The orchestra is quite good, but the hall is terrible.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_190.wav|31|The goals were good.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_371.wav|95|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_042.wav|41|The main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_103.wav|85|We had to push to get a goal.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_238.wav|100|They tried to give her advice.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_216.wav|56|The cuts were made within an hour of each other.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_184.wav|96|A career as a doctor is on hold.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_044.wav|94|There will be no shortage of quality applicants.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_387.wav|0|They like being on the front pages of the newspapers.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_489.wav|75|Something has got to change.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_291.wav|16|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_294.wav|96|A tribunal would then consider the seriousness of the incident.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_304.wav|7|They can leave at any time.)
DUMMY2/p270/p270_323.wav|8|What do we want to do that for ?
DUMMY2/p246/p246_043.wav|5|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_217.wav|3|Being investor ready is a good start.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_094.wav|95|It's so hard to shift.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_216.wav|25|I am delighted for Simon.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_129.wav|7|Tiger is not the norm.)
DUMMY2/p279/p279_192.wav|25|It is tough, but possible.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_283.wav|38|Does it, Noel?
DUMMY2/p231/p231_431.wav|50|I was in jail for five years.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_062.wav|95|What do we do ?
DUMMY2/p345/p345_255.wav|82|I don't think he was being very fair.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_051.wav|106|Perhaps it is eyeing a mortgage bank.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_368.wav|19|He suffered a broken back and other injuries.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_019.wav|63|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_418.wav|38|However, in Orkney, there was a mixed response.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_004.wav|79|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_418.wav|54|She can't say where she was, what she did.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_058.wav|9|Four other charges were dropped.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_234.wav|4|Where do we go from here?
DUMMY2/p343/p343_364.wav|21|There's a hint of classical.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_215.wav|71|"That has been the easy part."
DUMMY2/p274/p274_413.wav|32|But the foundations have been laid.)
DUMMY2/p254/p254_322.wav|41|It's not long enough.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_008.wav|81|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_324.wav|7|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.)
DUMMY2/p340/p340_236.wav|74|Her heart was not in it.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_381.wav|16|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_284.wav|13|He has changed my life forever.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_005.wav|53|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_047.wav|67|But it is all by design.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_359.wav|55|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
DUMMY2/p318/p318_334.wav|19|She has nothing to say to journalists.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_226.wav|77|Murray Financial has fallen at the first hurdle.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_048.wav|16|Our people are ready.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_164.wav|74|My brother is not like that.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_284.wav|92|He preferred to concentrate on the positive.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_146.wav|60|Who was being affected?
DUMMY2/p252/p252_403.wav|55|Had this been common practice ?
DUMMY2/p279/p279_117.wav|25|My office is bare.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_216.wav|59|You should always be able to get out in some direction.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_265.wav|93|It is also very valuable.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_312.wav|8|There was no hint of scandal.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_123.wav|71|"Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince."
DUMMY2/p252/p252_101.wav|55|In his new cabinet role as party chairman, it will become his primary task.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_104.wav|84|She was there for the start of the campaign.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_240.wav|50|It is now the big brother.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_140.wav|66|They really did a great job.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_182.wav|81|He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_215.wav|5|The report is due out next month.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_054.wav|50|She said she was really sorry.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_070.wav|36|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
DUMMY2/p363/p363_189.wav|6|We're trying to get rounded performers.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_225.wav|82|I can't get away from it.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_174.wav|59|However, he said the money had not been wasted.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_075.wav|38|By this point the couple were approaching fast.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_394.wav|2|By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_056.wav|60|That view has not altered.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_418.wav|49|Lord Sainsbury is not a newcomer.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_382.wav|0|A review is under way.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_001.wav|58|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_153.wav|64|I will certainly be having words with him.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_179.wav|92|There's nothing new in that argument.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_063.wav|88|It is not the fault of one man, of course.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_137.wav|107|We are very concerned about controller fatigue.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_230.wav|79|Eight others are also believed to have died.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_239.wav|16|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_332.wav|27|Is that an issue?
DUMMY2/p339/p339_397.wav|18|Is it the shape of things to come?
DUMMY2/p270/p270_287.wav|8|The target is to break even by Christmas.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_307.wav|13|By now he was very ill with cancer.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_168.wav|95|What do we want to do that for ?
DUMMY2/p285/p285_269.wav|2|Of course I was tempted.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_018.wav|44|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_276.wav|79|That is one point of view.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_033.wav|18|It really has not been their season.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_180.wav|80|I always felt they played for me.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_096.wav|94|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_101.wav|52|We are already seeing some positive results.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_317.wav|42|He confirmed that there had been no warning.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_191.wav|3|It is not in the public interest.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_043.wav|36|There's been a wake up call for the sector this week.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_026.wav|61|They should be so lucky.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_305.wav|60|I'm really proud of her.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_033.wav|73|It was clear.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_039.wav|56|Everything else is a bonus.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_232.wav|77|The trust was unable to pay the fourth interim dividend.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_071.wav|46|I wanted the illusion of space and depth.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_079.wav|72|Could it be?
DUMMY2/p264/p264_396.wav|65|It has been only average.)
DUMMY2/p362/p362_403.wav|15|It's going to be great!
DUMMY2/p226/p226_064.wav|43|It is not great art.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_148.wav|87|I was left-handed, but it was just a matter of practice.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_383.wav|17|It has removed a bit of guilt.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_214.wav|51|Broke the birdie record.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_253.wav|64|We are still getting signals.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_098.wav|89|Today I couldn't run on it.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_048.wav|29|We have to look beyond the very short term.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_296.wav|31|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_304.wav|40|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_106.wav|28|Our people should be immune.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_363.wav|17|I love the moment of being first.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_353.wav|2|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_069.wav|78|It was an outstanding performance.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_121.wav|78|In the end, we did not spend a penny on him.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_280.wav|30|However, the move was bitterly criticised last night.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_100.wav|3|It should be a condition of employment.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_035.wav|67|It shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_113.wav|2|Tony Blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from Dublin.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_418.wav|8|People will see this over time.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_397.wav|8|It has happened for generations.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_348.wav|84|The decision is an absolute disgrace.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_326.wav|34|We will deal with the refugees.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_222.wav|104|She has so much to offer.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_171.wav|3|Much of the equipment was new.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_109.wav|25|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_038.wav|31|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_392.wav|77|Finally, he paid for the movie.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_226.wav|63|Scotland will play its part.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_367.wav|66|The surprise is its product is so poor.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_005.wav|100|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_156.wav|32|Donald Dewar was passionate about his politics.)
DUMMY2/p233/p233_011.wav|84|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_370.wav|94|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_328.wav|86|My first concern is for the safety of the public.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_006.wav|97|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_219.wav|72|It isn't a happy memory.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_445.wav|65|It was an outstanding performance.)
DUMMY2/p231/p231_399.wav|50|Clark is back on top form.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_116.wav|91|The motive for the shooting was not known.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_219.wav|77|He remains a main board director of Royal.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_196.wav|52|was everything done to save people ?
DUMMY2/p374/p374_319.wav|11|We should keep this recent assault in perspective.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_162.wav|0|And does it ?
DUMMY2/p258/p258_135.wav|26|I am totally devoted to this job.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_197.wav|88|The hearing continues today.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_222.wav|8|Do I think about them often ?
DUMMY2/p318/p318_403.wav|19|It would have been very easily done.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_216.wav|44|People are so negative about the whole business.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_076.wav|52|It had little effect on European equity markets.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_133.wav|82|I don't know where that one came from.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_185.wav|45|I had a train to catch.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_118.wav|96|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_001.wav|53|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_342.wav|68|I get to work with very good people.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_115.wav|106|He was unprepared for this fight.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_313.wav|2|Cruelty is an accepted feature of conflict in the Balkans.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_205.wav|75|It caused a lot of upset.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_104.wav|43|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_387.wav|4|My players are precious to me.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_195.wav|13|We had to work hard for it.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_408.wav|70|It is legally binding.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_197.wav|85|It is not just the agencies.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_104.wav|63|Until you hit the big games.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_186.wav|89|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_264.wav|96|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_301.wav|49|Clearly, she says, she would never resort to such devices.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_258.wav|28|Technically, it was a very good performance by Scotland.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_338.wav|4|Was it just negligent.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_180.wav|0|They need to look after themselves.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_339.wav|6|I am feeling on top of the world.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_311.wav|96|Special measures were needed.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_111.wav|33|You have caught a serial killer.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_324.wav|64|I haven't won the world title.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_022.wav|100|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_329.wav|6|They haven't got a hope.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_346.wav|63|It is a terrible state of affairs.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_351.wav|101|After the match, do you ?
DUMMY2/p258/p258_148.wav|26|My Dad is a hero.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_260.wav|92|But it was the sensible thing to do.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_228.wav|50|We played them off the pitch.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_047.wav|70|You had better believe it.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_037.wav|70|They're just different.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_346.wav|36|It was almost too much.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_279.wav|4|I was shaking on the blocks.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_196.wav|94|We must keep our feet on the ground.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_078.wav|40|A review is under way.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_108.wav|39|Our preference is to play in midweek.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_190.wav|50|I'm interested in interesting work.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_336.wav|8|Age is not like other forms of discrimination.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_201.wav|1|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_207.wav|26|Feel the heat?
DUMMY2/p283/p283_226.wav|95|You could feel the heat.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_057.wav|58|Sex is fun?
DUMMY2/p262/p262_393.wav|45|Emotions were complex.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_240.wav|10|The statement contained no surprises.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_354.wav|80|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_025.wav|57|It's nice to hear.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_089.wav|38|The rubble was right up to the ceiling.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_253.wav|20|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_035.wav|32|This represents a tough game for us.)
DUMMY2/p240/p240_355.wav|93|This is a friendly match?
DUMMY2/p253/p253_307.wav|70|The Premier League has been a huge success.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_096.wav|17|Now he will have to start again.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_177.wav|12|It shows that we are a civilised society.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_168.wav|83|I was in the train station overnight.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_288.wav|57|It became a book by itself.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_126.wav|58|There were no casualties.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_314.wav|26|Scotland were beaten again.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_263.wav|11|Is this accurate?
DUMMY2/p286/p286_130.wav|63|Harry Potter has lost his magic.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_034.wav|59|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_288.wav|106|And, finally, I have good news for the songbirds of Glasgow.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_008.wav|41|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_025.wav|75|A shortlist is to be drawn up next month.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_039.wav|15|To beat the European champion is quite nice.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_409.wav|96|Quality Meat Scotland was vigorous in its defence of the labelling.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_243.wav|2|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_381.wav|52|This is not a small amount of money.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_179.wav|73|I put the drawing down.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_294.wav|75|The partnership was set up during the summer.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_077.wav|47|People must remain vigilant.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_300.wav|106|Everything else is a bonus.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_373.wav|2|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_068.wav|52|But it was not all bad news.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_257.wav|43|Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_146.wav|14|This represents a tough game for us.)
DUMMY2/p294/p294_385.wav|104|However, many questions remained unanswered.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_345.wav|68|And we know that, because we know the hairdresser.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_087.wav|29|The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_160.wav|3|There is no common ground.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_012.wav|10|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_250.wav|20|We are in a war.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_330.wav|33|They're just a nonsense.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_221.wav|92|This is the best moment of my career.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_050.wav|22|There will be plenty to keep them occupied.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_185.wav|94|They know no other way.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_387.wav|36|Now, though, he has an incentive.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_382.wav|70|It's just outrageous.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_341.wav|52|Put another way, they just won't do it.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_085.wav|73|This one did.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_056.wav|4|At the moment, Michael is in a class of his own.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_020.wav|66|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_158.wav|85|The things writers and directors say!
DUMMY2/p317/p317_321.wav|97|Not that anyone has actually suffered, for her art.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_081.wav|23|A teacher is, really, about unity.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_161.wav|100|The pension levels will remain the same.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_166.wav|61|The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_128.wav|24|That's not an assumption that I had made.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_439.wav|89|It won the match.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_230.wav|56|I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_085.wav|41|My office is bare.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_137.wav|43|It will be too hot.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_316.wav|18|It was an insult.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_010.wav|37|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_118.wav|66|Whoever said that cannot have seen it.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_378.wav|82|I did not name it.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_293.wav|71|"That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients."
DUMMY2/p299/p299_360.wav|58|The place became a war zone.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_211.wav|73|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_298.wav|4|We were in different places, usually in cellars.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_192.wav|3|Well, this article is a bit like that.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_367.wav|17|But it's got to be worth it.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_177.wav|29|The expansions will be financed by the Clydesdale Bank.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_373.wav|52|They know the truth, they really know the truth.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_123.wav|61|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_211.wav|79|It is his script.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_336.wav|59|Action is needed now.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_054.wav|71|"But the law is very clear on this."
DUMMY2/p259/p259_395.wav|7|After the match, do you ?)
DUMMY2/p266/p266_118.wav|20|I did not see any reason to change the captain.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_118.wav|33|There's nothing new in that argument.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_082.wav|55|What kind of a man does that, Mr Dick ?
DUMMY2/p336/p336_195.wav|98|Safety is our first concern.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_461.wav|14|It's because they can't understand the language.)
DUMMY2/p299/p299_321.wav|58|It is a question of balance.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_419.wav|34|I haven't enjoyed the last couple of years.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_091.wav|36|We could not get any possession.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_321.wav|95|This is the correct decision.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_061.wav|51|I would not want to be young again.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_223.wav|39|A deadline is still essential.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_314.wav|59|For the moment, our position remains the same.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_130.wav|107|THE headless man has finally developed a face.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_252.wav|43|There will be widespread support on all sides.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_196.wav|8|Motorists will buy passes in advance.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_333.wav|24|The party lasted all night.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_048.wav|59|We need to chat.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_300.wav|7|The stage was set for a showdown.)
DUMMY2/p283/p283_372.wav|95|Ferguson is a good example.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_239.wav|90|He was good, but not that good.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_098.wav|48|The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_360.wav|75|They have broken that promise.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_228.wav|25|My neighbours are horrified.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_393.wav|63|How do you take them away ?
DUMMY2/p313/p313_124.wav|76|Life, as many people know it, in other words.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_205.wav|97|Pressure of work is no excuse.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_031.wav|80|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_240.wav|78|This is a fight to the death.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_364.wav|19|I am amazed at what he's done.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_015.wav|60|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_122.wav|59|What will happen then?
DUMMY2/p279/p279_061.wav|25|Here's a clue.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_106.wav|54|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_060.wav|91|They have a way of proclaiming themselves.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_393.wav|15|My mind was made up.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_016.wav|41|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_116.wav|71|"She has been shot."
DUMMY2/p260/p260_341.wav|81|He was the architect.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_348.wav|83|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_310.wav|53|This is the version which appeared in our paper.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_033.wav|67|And we have a singer.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_029.wav|29|This is a central issue.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_314.wav|87|It was a lovely sunset.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_332.wav|29|I would do away with the dress code.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_324.wav|72|We are all ecstatic.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_386.wav|66|That gave us some confidence.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_382.wav|84|The road was closed for several hours.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_358.wav|20|It was one in the afternoon.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_064.wav|51|There are schoolboys in uniform.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_031.wav|32|Mr Darling yesterday dismissed the criticism.)
DUMMY2/p276/p276_272.wav|106|was everything done to save people ?
DUMMY2/p286/p286_344.wav|63|It looks as though the issue with The Scotsman is too sensitive.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_232.wav|74|Later, a very different story emerged.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_152.wav|59|It became a book by itself.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_065.wav|5|Robin Williams is very subdued.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_147.wav|24|You are a gambling man.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_142.wav|73|They have not been named.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_224.wav|99|It was good fun.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_290.wav|16|Painful, but only because it's true.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_025.wav|36|She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_174.wav|78|Like the others, he was arrested.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_070.wav|14|It's not covered by the insurance.)
DUMMY2/p301/p301_025.wav|91|But it was a great decision he joked.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_169.wav|107|We must put a marker down.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_210.wav|48|Bottling is now the core business.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_221.wav|107|They make it look very easy.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_245.wav|27|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_117.wav|69|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_200.wav|73|I had decided to quit the show.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_190.wav|68|English rugby is on the brink of extinction, though, it's official.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_323.wav|11|It really is good to be back.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_021.wav|11|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_360.wav|3|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_376.wav|67|It is a simple equation.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_168.wav|51|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_135.wav|74|He said something in his work.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_248.wav|97|This is a huge event.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_120.wav|62|We are satisfied that this is the case.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_302.wav|103|I'm feeling very pleased.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_128.wav|18|But it was not just the land.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_017.wav|41|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_090.wav|71|"I love the Dome."
DUMMY2/p341/p341_385.wav|66|And that's the question for the Chamber.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_219.wav|51|That it is a brand name.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_063.wav|41|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_192.wav|92|They tried to give her advice.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_071.wav|104|It took about five or six hours.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_127.wav|84|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_059.wav|79|I want to deal with this stuff.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_221.wav|88|I had no choice.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_327.wav|50|The king is delighted by the honour.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_339.wav|87|Dancing will help his ankles and his feet.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_360.wav|53|They have the cash and the fire power.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_102.wav|69|It is annoying.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_140.wav|106|It particularly increases under-age drinking, he claimed.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_266.wav|47|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_476.wav|50|That was the first time I worked with Richard.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_216.wav|38|Millions of British jobs depend on Europe.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_126.wav|14|You can spend money on housing.)
DUMMY2/p286/p286_392.wav|63|Does it matter ?
DUMMY2/p226/p226_143.wav|43|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_078.wav|14|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.)
DUMMY2/p304/p304_005.wav|72|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_183.wav|106|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_191.wav|19|We have understood the problems for some time.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_043.wav|91|Parts of the system are already overstretched.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_058.wav|16|There's a danger.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_281.wav|39|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_162.wav|49|We've got the top three.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_226.wav|24|Who was she ?
DUMMY2/p245/p245_251.wav|59|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_198.wav|84|We are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_170.wav|59|The procedure is the same in all cases.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_219.wav|57|She should not be blamed.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_244.wav|54|We hope this scheme will change that.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_192.wav|86|I wanted to put myself on the line.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_035.wav|101|A hostile bid is prevented for another nine months.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_200.wav|9|The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_056.wav|85|They treated me with respect and courtesy.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_335.wav|75|There was no time scale.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_378.wav|65|John gave up everything to be with me.)
DUMMY2/p293/p293_263.wav|23|It feels like a privilege.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_477.wav|65|The child has denied murder.)
DUMMY2/p260/p260_088.wav|81|It is a lifeline.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_394.wav|32|The board meetings will be held in Edinburgh.)
DUMMY2/p268/p268_019.wav|87|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_197.wav|81|It was worth a photograph.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_334.wav|81|Relief was beyond belief.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_396.wav|21|Sub Not Used, McArthur.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_199.wav|73|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_128.wav|10|I didn't feel under any pressure.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_262.wav|8|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_039.wav|29|Among them are many criminals.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_318.wav|2|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_312.wav|46|I, like an idiot, agreed.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_299.wav|69|You are the glory.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_148.wav|105|It is like a football team.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_300.wav|35|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_176.wav|58|My life has been destroyed.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_132.wav|40|I am now unemployed.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_002.wav|40|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_166.wav|2|Seven people were later detained by police.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_197.wav|102|We have only nine months to go.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_186.wav|17|Tony Blair, can you see her face?
DUMMY2/p238/p238_206.wav|37|Truth is the child of time.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_156.wav|61|It is huge.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_392.wav|58|It was a sell-out.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_321.wav|0|He has been told by the doctor to rest.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_120.wav|80|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_134.wav|100|We will try to find someone.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_075.wav|41|It's good news and long overdue.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_030.wav|89|There's a story, too.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_245.wav|47|In fact, we were all over the shop.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_137.wav|22|The ethos of the school was outstanding.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_421.wav|8|My aim is a top six finish.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_364.wav|53|Both players gave so much to the side.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_328.wav|18|Words are not enough.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_089.wav|105|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_427.wav|27|I'm very grateful.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_370.wav|64|Both managements are very supportive.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_294.wav|58|It's a source of deep concern.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_088.wav|63|It's so hard to shift.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_221.wav|96|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_265.wav|67|Today we can say that a new era has begun.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_146.wav|21|I told that to the police.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_179.wav|48|Did he trip ?
DUMMY2/p305/p305_189.wav|54|The sleeper was six hours late.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_037.wav|93|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_335.wav|35|Does that put pressure on us ?
DUMMY2/p259/p259_167.wav|7|The woman was his wife.)
DUMMY2/p277/p277_059.wav|89|Here's a clue.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_334.wav|100|There will be good prospects ahead.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_307.wav|41|Craig is a major concern for us.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_396.wav|87|Defensive stocks attracted some interest.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_188.wav|11|We have not given up.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_252.wav|55|The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_195.wav|8|We represent a wide range of society.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_058.wav|67|What was the main difference ?
DUMMY2/p318/p318_406.wav|19|It's going to be a new challenge.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_191.wav|88|The principle is quite clear.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_338.wav|24|And he goes with it.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_063.wav|0|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
DUMMY2/p334/p334_221.wav|38|This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_050.wav|34|We have been let down by these people.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_054.wav|26|It's that kind of place.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_172.wav|13|It's just a normal life.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_456.wav|39|They offer a kind of narrative.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_191.wav|40|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_295.wav|48|Friday night was a pretty good night.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_269.wav|75|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_222.wav|51|They should come forward.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_320.wav|31|Referees are easy targets.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_188.wav|32|The interim dividend has been passed.)
DUMMY2/p258/p258_280.wav|26|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_007.wav|79|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_207.wav|48|We are now working with full-time on future product.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_237.wav|58|I hate the word.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_095.wav|7|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.)
DUMMY2/p361/p361_012.wav|79|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_221.wav|99|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_239.wav|53|Jim was down there with his wife.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_086.wav|99|It's never too late.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_243.wav|17|This represents a tough game for us.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_361.wav|74|They really want to do it.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_206.wav|22|It opens the door to the Champions League.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_384.wav|11|Two others were also seriously injured.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_282.wav|2|Yet, it worked.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_095.wav|30|There was an element of jealousy.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_342.wav|19|When it comes down to it, this is a job.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_344.wav|60|They have brought in the replacement.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_336.wav|65|This fact is supported by audience research.)
DUMMY2/p310/p310_021.wav|17|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_051.wav|36|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_083.wav|15|I thought he was part of the camera.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_026.wav|62|This was a rationing decision.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_255.wav|19|Our people are paying high prices.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_343.wav|22|Bob Dylan is getting old.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_052.wav|34|Nor does he have any desire to be.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_182.wav|95|I'd love to be like Peter.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_227.wav|67|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_087.wav|37|We will pay their bills.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_097.wav|7|Ferguson must take the blame.)
DUMMY2/p279/p279_341.wav|25|Like his acting, it was an accident.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_327.wav|29|It is hoped to complete the merger in the summer.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_251.wav|61|It's a lovely, lovely film.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_306.wav|37|No-one is predicting a sudden rebound.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_365.wav|96|However, it was well worth the wait.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_008.wav|0|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_322.wav|78|We did something about it.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_292.wav|3|His leader wanted to celebrate.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_099.wav|53|Even if he doesn't have any lines.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_249.wav|27|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_296.wav|5|We are not going to forget.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_186.wav|14|It is vital to clarify their role.)
DUMMY2/p339/p339_298.wav|18|I have no worry about that.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_267.wav|69|It was very fast.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_058.wav|26|It should be devolved.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_181.wav|84|They thought they had found a home.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_171.wav|18|Just think about the lines.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_396.wav|1|Then  all was revealed.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_091.wav|38|Thankfully, there were no reports of anything serious.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_387.wav|56|We are satisfied with this outcome.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_276.wav|86|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_415.wav|98|The auction has seven days to run.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_214.wav|2|People should make their own decisions.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_134.wav|42|What did they think of her voice?
DUMMY2/p226/p226_138.wav|43|The whole thing of doing the movie was a risk.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_303.wav|54|They made a huge impression on me.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_046.wav|78|It is all about the story.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_219.wav|50|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_186.wav|40|It's an idea.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_156.wav|18|This news is really depressing.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_052.wav|25|We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_065.wav|75|The talks were announced yesterday by Brian Wilson, the foreign office minister.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_182.wav|101|We are just glad to be alive.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_037.wav|78|History is in the making.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_171.wav|67|A new season has offered a fresh start for both men.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_245.wav|94|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_347.wav|28|Hopefully we can use this as a platform.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_094.wav|59|We want to get to the final, anyway.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_130.wav|29|He is a great addition to our team.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_016.wav|67|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_133.wav|87|Monty is great in his own backyard.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_270.wav|6|However, that is not in itself enough.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_325.wav|67|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_017.wav|3|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_170.wav|30|But she's also beautiful behind the face.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_302.wav|72|Is Saddam a threat?
DUMMY2/p279/p279_337.wav|25|It's always nice to play on Centre Court.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_136.wav|73|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_335.wav|0|But the New Year was special.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_027.wav|10|Life was like a timetable.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_227.wav|99|The track is currently covered in snow.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_167.wav|10|As far as we were concerned the deal with Kennedy was dead.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_029.wav|65|The local primary is excellent.)
DUMMY2/p335/p335_231.wav|49|They scored a goal, but we have to keep playing.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_299.wav|64|However, consumers may take a different view.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_349.wav|47|You need a licence to run a pub.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_033.wav|84|This is a central issue.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_198.wav|73|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_049.wav|50|There's nothing we could do about this.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_269.wav|63|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_291.wav|82|I don't think we could have expected better.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_175.wav|70|Blair's response was weak.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_066.wav|4|In the end, however, it all came together.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_032.wav|58|It's easy to see why.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_237.wav|24|The transaction is not feasible.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_371.wav|10|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_042.wav|22|I have played really well all year.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_228.wav|77|We have learned a tremendous amount.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_021.wav|30|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drop increases.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_211.wav|49|The island will never recover.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_257.wav|0|It was a cry for help.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_151.wav|99|It is huge.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_231.wav|69|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_296.wav|106|A more exhaustive analysis is in progress.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_151.wav|90|There's a sense of excess in the novel.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_250.wav|40|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_092.wav|16|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_409.wav|97|They have enough intrusion at the time.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_015.wav|70|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_102.wav|60|They had been forced to walk.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_301.wav|90|Our task is to complete the picture.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_260.wav|7|It will now be revived.)
DUMMY2/p339/p339_088.wav|18|We spoke about a few people.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_395.wav|76|It's time to fight a decisive battle.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_371.wav|63|But the Foreign Secretary can cope.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_317.wav|8|The pound has also suffered.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_052.wav|21|There was still more disquiet in Israel.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_324.wav|99|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_316.wav|106|It has been recorded twice.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_072.wav|0|A government is a government is a government.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_322.wav|56|But it is a slow process.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_098.wav|31|I had a ball today.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_337.wav|41|It should be scrapped.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_203.wav|61|Is that success ?
DUMMY2/p277/p277_100.wav|89|I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_102.wav|99|Oil embargo endorsed.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_309.wav|40|The minister is the engineer.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_126.wav|102|There is a lack of chemistry.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_257.wav|16|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_236.wav|18|I'll take it as it comes.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_279.wav|93|It's a way of life.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_365.wav|37|His background is firmly in venture capital.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_259.wav|12|It's the stop-gap before extinction.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_276.wav|74|They might be surprised by the response.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_085.wav|25|It works for us.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_196.wav|77|This will be our new beginning.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_241.wav|17|Several hundred people attended yesterday.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_217.wav|82|It's a human tragedy.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_398.wav|95|Theatre is not a museum.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_034.wav|44|The crackdown is launched today by the government.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_223.wav|69|Until they came to do it.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_226.wav|96|Mental health is a massive issue.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_306.wav|26|This is a war over our home.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_220.wav|73|We were awful.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_339.wav|84|I've learned from my mistakes.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_354.wav|53|Friday night was a pretty good night.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_200.wav|98|Openness is always the best way.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_050.wav|74|But it was no problem.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_027.wav|97|Yet it is all for two good causes.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_006.wav|74|When the sunlight strikes the raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_118.wav|71|"Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton."
DUMMY2/p339/p339_350.wav|18|I thought their commitment was superb.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_095.wav|47|Journalists should make him.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_224.wav|35|What are you not good at ?
DUMMY2/p326/p326_362.wav|28|The mix with Tiger is perfect.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_421.wav|103|I'll never think of myself as a star.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_053.wav|61|She looked so young.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_308.wav|7|Blair also had a penalty.)
DUMMY2/p334/p334_219.wav|38|You just have to accept.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_183.wav|35|They will run a mile.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_185.wav|60|It's their moment of choice.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_377.wav|68|I have learned a lot from him.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_089.wav|83|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_388.wav|78|I would be interested in another attempt.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_148.wav|13|But we are not immune to the problem.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_157.wav|8|My Dad is a hero.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_069.wav|27|We should have known.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_280.wav|73|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_092.wav|12|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_263.wav|52|The same trend showed up throughout Britain.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_022.wav|92|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_159.wav|21|When it comes down to it, this is a job.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_198.wav|34|It was published yesterday on the internet.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_232.wav|107|This is her first senior Scottish selection.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_093.wav|60|That's what makes it interesting.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_065.wav|65|It is nice to be a woman and a wife.)
DUMMY2/p360/p360_346.wav|60|We are working so hard.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_128.wav|85|The time is up for Iraq to comply.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_329.wav|3|The family is not interested in the value of the house.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_383.wav|72|I think we're going to make it.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_014.wav|48|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_313.wav|93|And he goes with it.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_385.wav|69|It's a real problem.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_244.wav|12|At that time, there was no infection within five miles.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_143.wav|11|I told the players that at half-time.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_087.wav|2|We knew they could do it.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_291.wav|102|It's not even finished.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_197.wav|55|Now he is back on top again.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_349.wav|42|It was all too little, too late.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_172.wav|18|It all depends on the wind.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_168.wav|82|But it won't be the same.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_394.wav|62|We are keen to have him back.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_039.wav|53|She will get through it I'm sure.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_177.wav|69|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_084.wav|25|Is there a new way forward?
DUMMY2/p253/p253_373.wav|70|Something is wrong.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_037.wav|61|It was clear.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_281.wav|47|The attacker died in the crash.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_095.wav|107|There was an element of jealousy.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_158.wav|75|We did what we had to do.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_042.wav|72|It was an ambush.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_328.wav|55|We were caught out.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_392.wav|76|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_007.wav|103|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_055.wav|47|It will take time.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_135.wav|68|I first met him last summer.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_319.wav|65|Not one person spoke badly.)
DUMMY2/p226/p226_260.wav|43|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_233.wav|32|He does not much like the Liberal Democrats.)
DUMMY2/p266/p266_138.wav|20|I was dead.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_228.wav|55|The global market was about flat.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_375.wav|91|He has changed my life for ever.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_345.wav|98|That is why we are here.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_002.wav|9|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_113.wav|17|But there is another side.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_405.wav|92|I am not retiring.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_039.wav|67|They're just different.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_373.wav|25|It has been a lovely family occasion.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_061.wav|20|We recorded it at our own expense.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_391.wav|33|All were believed to be adults.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_174.wav|67|It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_230.wav|104|Who will run the bigger show?
DUMMY2/p269/p269_295.wav|94|This is a national crisis.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_284.wav|42|They were not up to the required standard.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_054.wav|23|General, You didn't get a modified.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_067.wav|50|Only water is currently allowed.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_223.wav|26|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_271.wav|75|However, he lasted only five days before going on the run.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_320.wav|9|Our task is to complete the picture.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_354.wav|54|It was a long process, but we got there.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_033.wav|86|People love to see this stuff.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_072.wav|89|That was a gold medal for certain.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_372.wav|54|There is nothing like a fresh start.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_248.wav|30|He should be a great asset.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_264.wav|85|This is still happening in the US.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_022.wav|96|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_092.wav|56|He was prepared for this.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_159.wav|92|I feel alive and good today.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_121.wav|70|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_016.wav|75|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_003.wav|76|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_164.wav|19|Agents and coaches must be paid.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_106.wav|107|But that attachment took a lot of growing.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_105.wav|83|I don't want to use it.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_087.wav|107|Yesterday, one, from Aberdeen, was postponed.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_434.wav|50|But it can be done.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_358.wav|64|It has been recorded twice.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_178.wav|82|Now, it's all right.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_328.wav|4|No doubt the council would welcome the proposal.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_108.wav|37|We have thought about doing lots of things.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_360.wav|55|They had better be.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_277.wav|71|"You've got to have both sides."
DUMMY2/p240/p240_348.wav|93|They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_061.wav|19|The firm was down and almost out.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_361.wav|13|Do not forget about Monaco.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_150.wav|66|Surrey police said no body had been found.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_012.wav|101|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_236.wav|37|That proved enough to settle the home side down.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_011.wav|52|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_299.wav|13|I'm going to miss it.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_060.wav|45|I fell against him.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_399.wav|26|It was a breathtaking moment.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_063.wav|7|Only water is currently allowed.)
DUMMY2/p249/p249_331.wav|80|The same things will happen with GM foods.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_030.wav|35|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_219.wav|48|So I got a blood test.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_415.wav|51|Jackson may well be right.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_371.wav|96|The scene is about this ?
DUMMY2/p257/p257_015.wav|105|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_127.wav|60|We are under no illusions about this.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_205.wav|103|Thankfully, we have started to listen to our customers.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_195.wav|6|Why is he not fighting for the Union?
DUMMY2/p243/p243_068.wav|53|But it was not all bad news.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_425.wav|48|Scoring in our first game was a bonus for me.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_179.wav|45|That has been the easy part.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_394.wav|40|There were no immediate reports of injuries.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_198.wav|78|I would like to continue to develop.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_106.wav|82|It's as eventful as it is momentous.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_125.wav|53|I think there's not much between them.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_089.wav|57|Every time I play I do not understand their reaction.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_285.wav|20|Dialogue is the key.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_164.wav|40|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_282.wav|37|The happiness was slightly misplaced.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_282.wav|53|Overall, the last hole was good to the women.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_004.wav|92|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_020.wav|81|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_163.wav|68|It's now down in black and white.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_445.wav|39|No, because it was too many.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_173.wav|78|We were all over the place in the first half.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_319.wav|56|The letters are going out today.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_134.wav|99|Our intentions are real.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_397.wav|40|He will be judged by his actions.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_294.wav|64|Insurance will be covered by the receiving galleries.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_096.wav|63|Are you from the rugby ?
DUMMY2/p257/p257_307.wav|105|Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_081.wav|83|What has changed?
DUMMY2/p334/p334_053.wav|38|plays in dark blue.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_159.wav|67|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_296.wav|51|What are you going to do exactly?
DUMMY2/p304/p304_407.wav|72|They are different types.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_094.wav|53|There is no issue of national security involved here.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_092.wav|98|Singing is my first love.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_079.wav|27|Is there a new way forward?
DUMMY2/p351/p351_260.wav|33|I think it was his parents.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_301.wav|101|I must do something about it.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_199.wav|80|However, this idea is never developed.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_223.wav|50|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_098.wav|92|The time of judgment has arrived.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_251.wav|4|Mentally, you have to be tough.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_036.wav|93|It is marvellous.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_354.wav|87|Laura is an investment banker.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_273.wav|74|I am delighted for them.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_345.wav|42|Mini rugby is a great thing.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_266.wav|94|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_421.wav|4|It's very difficult and very worrying.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_016.wav|29|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_326.wav|84|Robert is a special talent.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_396.wav|26|I suspect the latter.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_088.wav|35|You might not make it.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_339.wav|41|It was good for us that they lost that day.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_423.wav|20|I've invented a village in East Lothian.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_341.wav|58|We just need the Government to act.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_046.wav|5|They said she was stable.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_290.wav|65|He died the following year.)
DUMMY2/p345/p345_251.wav|82|We were extremely arrogant.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_340.wav|103|It is now time for justice.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_384.wav|66|We only lost the third goal.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_245.wav|13|The balance isn't there at EMI.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_209.wav|64|Singing has gone out of fashion.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_072.wav|39|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_087.wav|4|Sub Not Used, McArthur.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_235.wav|93|And thought we would get away with it.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_118.wav|72|How can we ignore it?
DUMMY2/p316/p316_401.wav|85|How do you find the youngsters?
DUMMY2/p239/p239_003.wav|48|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_439.wav|24|I never won a penny throughout my career.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_220.wav|9|The second is the reaction of the Hibs fans.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_293.wav|27|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_116.wav|11|If that is not a warning, what is it?
DUMMY2/p227/p227_366.wav|29|Is it worth it ?
DUMMY2/p239/p239_140.wav|48|So it was at Easter Road.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_223.wav|90|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_249.wav|61|He says that he is no different from any other man.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_390.wav|77|There was a substantial explosion.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_162.wav|89|Well, he should know.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_151.wav|39|She died at her home.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_155.wav|19|I, like an idiot, agreed.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_344.wav|43|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_224.wav|84|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_268.wav|32|This will save interest charges.)
DUMMY2/p259/p259_460.wav|7|It is pretty bad news.)
DUMMY2/p269/p269_165.wav|94|It is an attitude of mind.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_207.wav|69|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_223.wav|75|They are looking at a flotation.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_270.wav|96|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_009.wav|46|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_089.wav|26|She's got to say something.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_011.wav|76|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_343.wav|69|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_264.wav|21|There is no room for error.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_041.wav|102|You're not stopping people using sunbeds.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_258.wav|42|The farmers had no choice in the matter.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_265.wav|87|Further growth will be funded from cash flow.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_180.wav|12|You will never forget the clutching horror.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_420.wav|103|I've been asked that already, this morning - on the radio.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_282.wav|26|It's so awful.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_297.wav|96|These figures are truly awful.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_164.wav|98|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_141.wav|68|It's a bit like a bereavement.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_072.wav|31|It works for us.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_058.wav|72|His track record is not promising.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_232.wav|7|Today we must not repeat that mistake.)
DUMMY2/p238/p238_034.wav|37|Overall it has been deeply frustrating and disappointing.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_268.wav|4|There is no point in denying that.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_301.wav|14|We will deliver at director level.)
DUMMY2/p292/p292_193.wav|13|How can they get one?
DUMMY2/p247/p247_069.wav|14|Only water is currently allowed.)
DUMMY2/p228/p228_123.wav|57|It is so sad.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_220.wav|79|It is an outrage.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_319.wav|75|It aims to produce its report before Christmas.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_149.wav|30|Well, it's not before time, is it?
DUMMY2/p300/p300_207.wav|102|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_240.wav|21|Is a drug dealer?
DUMMY2/p248/p248_187.wav|99|They need to look after themselves.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_178.wav|4|I was delighted with every one of them.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_416.wav|34|There is a spring in the step.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_158.wav|15|However, the story has a happy ending.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_260.wav|13|They were not at the property yesterday.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_102.wav|37|It's very dangerous for markets.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_014.wav|46|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_373.wav|77|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_094.wav|87|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
DUMMY2/p239/p239_299.wav|48|Everyone can have their opinion.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_257.wav|58|It's one up to the Scots.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_335.wav|57|A great deal has been achieved.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_419.wav|11|They have not been named.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_031.wav|69|This is the window.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_397.wav|62|And we all understand that.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_220.wav|61|I had decided to quit the show.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_285.wav|80|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_060.wav|55|Must be prepared to use it.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_246.wav|82|I am appalled by this news.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_207.wav|89|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_212.wav|8|British Midland has applied for permission to fly to the US.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_023.wav|35|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_196.wav|61|We are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_028.wav|39|Do I have a favourite ?
DUMMY2/p253/p253_349.wav|70|The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_396.wav|77|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_072.wav|75|These people are not big names.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_404.wav|64|She said he showed no remorse.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_075.wav|29|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_077.wav|65|The time has arrived for a review.)
DUMMY2/p363/p363_109.wav|6|It can be very worrying.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_351.wav|5|I was in the train station overnight.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_373.wav|68|I might also completely change the routine.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_152.wav|16|She had gone to the Catholic school.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_329.wav|62|It's all happening at a local level.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_306.wav|100|The partnership was set up during the summer.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_025.wav|77|A shortlist is to be drawn up next month.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_314.wav|53|He felt too close to head office.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_346.wav|77|Other people had looked at it.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_292.wav|17|So too Eriksson, as yet unbeaten on his travels with England.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_196.wav|74|There is no other way.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_243.wav|101|The irony was not lost.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_097.wav|73|He takes the job.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_323.wav|40|The figures are bad, but not that bad.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_050.wav|14|The outcome of their game isn't the important thing.)
DUMMY2/p238/p238_161.wav|37|He was just like a godfather to it.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_254.wav|4|That's my daughter acting.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_366.wav|69|There is no signature.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_270.wav|18|It is, but that's not the point.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_037.wav|68|Others may be trying to catch up.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_085.wav|104|It is the tip of the iceberg.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_134.wav|81|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_089.wav|102|We defended well, but couldn't do much in attack.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_042.wav|95|The boy is no longer with us.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_017.wav|61|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_157.wav|9|There's a pause.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_277.wav|70|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_059.wav|37|They desperately want some stability.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_398.wav|29|I can hardly believe it.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_373.wav|64|This is important for two reasons.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_138.wav|52|We must pay teachers to take rugby in schools.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_318.wav|90|It's not even finished.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_056.wav|54|Ten years on, that advice is beginning to pay dividends.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_087.wav|57|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_298.wav|88|It's going to be tough.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_169.wav|100|Are you going to win ?
DUMMY2/p261/p261_120.wav|100|I was deeply saddened by the death of Donald Dewar.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_005.wav|91|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_107.wav|94|He pleaded for caution.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_080.wav|85|They control the prices paid to farmers.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_328.wav|72|Who honestly expected anything else?
DUMMY2/p264/p264_355.wav|65|Her father had died recently.)
DUMMY2/p262/p262_329.wav|45|We are in the end game.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_278.wav|1|It was fit for royalty.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_070.wav|38|He will need that machine.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_001.wav|70|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_008.wav|65|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. )
DUMMY2/p345/p345_288.wav|82|My wife is coming over at the weekend.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_301.wav|58|Now there's an even bigger target.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_031.wav|64|Some will be deployed on submarines.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_056.wav|0|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_313.wav|26|We want to play at the worlds.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_059.wav|78|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_355.wav|81|We have big ideas.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_009.wav|88|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_128.wav|20|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_212.wav|83|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_358.wav|57|The play is based on a real-life event.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_349.wav|95|He did that every night I was with him.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_193.wav|83|It is a farce.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_397.wav|95|We came across the first set of bodies.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_235.wav|6|Will you just put it away?
DUMMY2/p245/p245_349.wav|59|It is not like working for a living.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_349.wav|78|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_154.wav|80|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_158.wav|7|I haven't made any definite decisions.)
DUMMY2/p305/p305_395.wav|54|I can't stop people thinking.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_068.wav|21|It's funny how it comes and goes.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_241.wav|85|I'm very happy indeed to be almost redundant.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_211.wav|17|He is a Satan.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_368.wav|89|He was the architect.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_312.wav|56|I had no intention of misleading anyone.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_144.wav|92|It does affect the staff and the prisoners.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_332.wav|64|That is as it may be.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_185.wav|0|It was a pre-emptive strike.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_151.wav|1|They have worked with each other.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_419.wav|4|I feel very strongly about that.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_110.wav|75|There's still plenty time left.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_366.wav|6|It is not needed, it should go.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_373.wav|85|I know we can play a lot better.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_175.wav|36|One season, they might do well.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_416.wav|35|No date has been set for a meeting.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_204.wav|85|He confirmed his fitness.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_008.wav|25|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_018.wav|58|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_136.wav|94|The whole thing of doing the movie was a risk.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_188.wav|56|They have the cash and the fire power.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_050.wav|88|What do you think they said?
DUMMY2/p312/p312_004.wav|62|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_007.wav|90|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_122.wav|75|Becoming a father was wonderful.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_275.wav|79|It is still under discussion with the board.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_406.wav|36|He took a draw on his cigarette.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_290.wav|83|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_289.wav|53|We played well at Aberdeen, though we lost.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_090.wav|0|Before the game we went for a pint.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_225.wav|106|You are a gambling man.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_012.wav|24|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_334.wav|104|It's hard, but we have had so much to do.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_414.wav|76|We never agreed to it.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_039.wav|2|Indeed, he does.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_175.wav|29|The jury is still out.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_012.wav|11|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_014.wav|26|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_212.wav|57|A deadline is still essential.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_224.wav|34|We aren't going to play better.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_150.wav|62|We still have a long, long way to go.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_185.wav|81|It is a farce.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_145.wav|62|He, too, was not satisfied.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_357.wav|4|They should have listened to me.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_048.wav|44|I didn't know the company all that well, or the dancers.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_304.wav|62|I think however, he was having a fit!
DUMMY2/p249/p249_135.wav|80|Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_328.wav|42|I'm delighted at Murray's appointment.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_353.wav|84|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_353.wav|41|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_329.wav|43|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_351.wav|74|I'm looking forward to coming home.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_288.wav|19|We have it on video.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_362.wav|87|The statement contained no surprises.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_155.wav|41|The weaknesses are few.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_206.wav|95|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_161.wav|10|The Internet is no substitute for customer service.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_245.wav|91|Which perhaps is just as well.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_100.wav|82|It was, for me, like a week in heaven.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_395.wav|24|Everyone could see the joke.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_403.wav|97|However, the groups denied the claims.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_246.wav|32|I was just a kid.)
DUMMY2/p265/p265_131.wav|73|She died at her home.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_062.wav|60|No person was charged.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_096.wav|18|What will it be?
DUMMY2/p236/p236_138.wav|75|It was a piece of art.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_251.wav|17|It will be even more difficult tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_020.wav|25|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_198.wav|107|This must be kept in total perspective.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_033.wav|100|That means an extra two years.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_051.wav|70|It is bizarre.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_420.wav|39|Such an attack is bizarre.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_266.wav|19|I had trouble with the producers.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_036.wav|74|Who was that?
DUMMY2/p233/p233_080.wav|84|On the night, it was not enough.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_371.wav|87|He looked at me before replying.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_438.wav|75|I chose to make a film.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_222.wav|6|Her appeal is to be heard this week.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_013.wav|14|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. )
DUMMY2/p226/p226_017.wav|43|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_196.wav|105|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_124.wav|104|It's an hour of the same response.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_021.wav|46|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_125.wav|70|There were no grounds for his action.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_381.wav|13|Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_480.wav|24|The casting of her husband was an accident.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_140.wav|4|It's a horrific incident.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_367.wav|58|Thus the story will continue to thrive.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_161.wav|86|Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_197.wav|21|A handful of those restrictions are in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_398.wav|33|I only wanted to give her a fright.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_228.wav|64|But Annika is just amazing.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_306.wav|14|Motherwell have no such good fortune.)
DUMMY2/p237/p237_075.wav|61|I was just trying to win the golf tournament.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_043.wav|63|He will need that machine.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_421.wav|18|He did very well, but didn't win.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_178.wav|64|I didn't mean to kill her.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_356.wav|70|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_218.wav|103|A quality audit officer has also been appointed.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_261.wav|10|Persuaded to change his mind.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_098.wav|39|You might not make it.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_185.wav|48|His job was not advertised.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_238.wav|19|There is nothing to fear.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_118.wav|12|Few other services in Scotland are affected, the spokesman said.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_128.wav|55|Evidence must not be held back.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_276.wav|46|Arguably, they have already done it.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_099.wav|79|Seriously, we are not concerned at all.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_275.wav|24|I got a yellow card.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_135.wav|46|No-one else is like Michael Jackson.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_419.wav|39|I can lead by example.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_191.wav|21|That tells you something.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_148.wav|56|This action reflects a slump in bookings.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_096.wav|38|It was a foolhardy decision.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_356.wav|58|But my heart is in athletics.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_283.wav|90|The attacker died in the crash.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_038.wav|21|We are a team of hard workers.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_188.wav|103|They will want to watch a winning team.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_159.wav|35|So what is the campaign about ?
DUMMY2/p307/p307_063.wav|22|Staff were invited to make their own proposals.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_015.wav|99|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_137.wav|2|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_034.wav|12|Blood samples have been taken.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_064.wav|73|Neither it is.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_177.wav|24|Being involved at that level is like an addiction.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_192.wav|23|But he is something special, is he not?
DUMMY2/p374/p374_257.wav|11|Our thoughts are with his family.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_056.wav|28|But they add up.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_296.wav|2|Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_128.wav|0|They scored with a penalty and a breakaway.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_014.wav|49|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_334.wav|2|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_102.wav|75|It became difficult for me.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_090.wav|44|Saddam Hussein has made the case against himself.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_255.wav|56|It was the climax of the thing.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_168.wav|79|The game was there to be won.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_295.wav|28|We won't let you down.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_274.wav|52|Meanwhile, the Trust presented its first grant awards for Scotland yesterday.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_128.wav|95|From it emerged a cup.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_241.wav|61|They tried to give her advice.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_014.wav|62|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_257.wav|3|The matter is under appeal.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_073.wav|10|This view was echoed by the other Scottish analyst.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_188.wav|30|I'm really proud of my young players.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_021.wav|56|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_215.wav|67|The procedures were not in place.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_032.wav|28|There we were on the first tee.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_313.wav|45|Funding for the science centre has come from a number of sources.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_022.wav|56|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_209.wav|5|In each case they were a goal down.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_268.wav|62|We're still talking about it.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_347.wav|78|But the New Year was special.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_162.wav|73|Blair's response was weak.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_028.wav|74|It's a horrific incident.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_328.wav|3|All of the management has invested in the firm.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_325.wav|68|I wanted, really, to deal with two opposite energies.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_230.wav|102|This is all part of opening the door.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_282.wav|95|Kingfisher can afford to wait.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_350.wav|62|It was not a difficult decision, he said.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_248.wav|9|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_144.wav|70|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_339.wav|100|What form did that take ?
DUMMY2/p304/p304_098.wav|72|We shouldn't have a rush to judgment.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_111.wav|10|He was jailed for a year.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_332.wav|105|I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_249.wav|47|I will not allow the destruction of the Scottish fishing industry.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_409.wav|100|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_281.wav|93|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_103.wav|55|Some young girls also came by last night.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_119.wav|67|It's not fair.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_112.wav|20|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_115.wav|87|Everything else is a bonus.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_336.wav|36|There was no time scale.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_317.wav|84|We are very strongly behind the bid.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_174.wav|45|I feel like my game has come a long way.

DUMMY2/p292/p292_114.wav|13|Together they will attempt to express the whole.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_038.wav|45|The problem is the pitch.
