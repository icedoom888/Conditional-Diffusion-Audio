DUMMY2/p282/p282_147.wav|83|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_402.wav|6|I am desperate to play for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_099.wav|71|"Meanwhile, the Scottish Consumer Council yesterday offered support for the new Bill."
DUMMY2/p362/p362_160.wav|15|Even for a British Open, this is different.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_166.wav|26|They thought they had found a home.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_335.wav|74|The government agreed to pay.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_373.wav|4|And then he laughs.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_092.wav|60|It was looking bad.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_361.wav|98|But this relative success has not been easy.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_225.wav|43|A career as a doctor is on hold.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_191.wav|13|I have nothing to hide.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_378.wav|72|Well, what can you do?
DUMMY2/p362/p362_046.wav|15|The cause is just.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_362.wav|46|And we're talking Big Money.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_161.wav|24|Life is still very tough for them.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_122.wav|44|I've got no secret.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_247.wav|82|No injuries were reported.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_288.wav|90|He was obviously very genuine.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_102.wav|27|I saw the whole thing.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_037.wav|36|It carried a double message.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_391.wav|11|The hotel was huge.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_261.wav|67|I was happily surprised.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_119.wav|16|It is rubbish.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_091.wav|76|It's a very, very special day.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_288.wav|52|No-one had seen this sort of thing before.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_008.wav|39|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_366.wav|82|I said at the time it was wrong.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_213.wav|95|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_032.wav|29|There, you were just a body.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_405.wav|64|They hold on for many years.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_408.wav|11|That was never their agenda.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_027.wav|77|Meetings will also remain private.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_038.wav|61|It is not for any other purpose.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_121.wav|99|She's got to say something.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_293.wav|92|My husband was angry.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_351.wav|10|And it was this one.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_464.wav|50|Driving has been the key.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_081.wav|82|It was that kind of afternoon.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_373.wav|78|Some of the passing was a disgrace.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_049.wav|91|Lord Sainsbury is not a newcomer.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_088.wav|58|A decision is expected today.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_318.wav|100|He was obviously very genuine.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_248.wav|100|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_094.wav|20|I love the Dome.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_434.wav|8|The British government does not want to know.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_129.wav|64|He was back to square one.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_174.wav|79|The quality of life is difficult for them.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_267.wav|84|George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_058.wav|45|Jobs could go.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_238.wav|17|Last year was not a good year.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_222.wav|92|My life has been turned upside down.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_277.wav|79|We are in this for the long haul.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_252.wav|0|If so, it is a funny time to introduce it.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_208.wav|5|It's not ideal.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_353.wav|87|Instead, he missed the lot.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_352.wav|15|The conversion didn't go over either.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_071.wav|39|It's all I can do.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_430.wav|48|We accept the new rules.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_437.wav|39|We shall not forget him.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_375.wav|94|The play is based on a real-life event.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_197.wav|5|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_223.wav|62|He is a very nice man.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_351.wav|39|Overall, we are very pleased.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_378.wav|42|They finished second and third.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_486.wav|48|It happened again, and again, and again.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_385.wav|16|Something is wrong.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_295.wav|41|That could change.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_265.wav|84|It is not just about pay.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_399.wav|14|Ferguson must take the blame.)
DUMMY2/p264/p264_344.wav|65|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.)
DUMMY2/p257/p257_375.wav|105|It is likely the rest of the market will follow suit.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_059.wav|85|It doesn't look as pretty.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_316.wav|90|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_249.wav|39|He has run a hell of a race.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_325.wav|84|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_092.wav|23|I seem to keep this for the majors.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_217.wav|19|He did his best, but it wasn't good enough.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_208.wav|47|Twaddle is a case in point.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_072.wav|33|I feel alive and good today.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_371.wav|28|That's always the case, isn't it?
DUMMY2/p329/p329_186.wav|103|I wanted, really, to deal with two opposite energies.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_304.wav|27|Eight new hospitals are set to be built.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_106.wav|100|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
DUMMY2/p255/p255_146.wav|31|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_190.wav|61|They receive a high profile in the media.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_139.wav|82|They were part of our own family.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_253.wav|89|Blood samples were taken.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_286.wav|44|We have been treated with complete contempt.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_139.wav|60|Elections would follow in about two years.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_409.wav|66|He needs to be.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_240.wav|29|We played them off the pitch.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_029.wav|67|I have a theory.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_133.wav|106|No one person or small group could be singled out.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_011.wav|55|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_083.wav|100|They lived for their children.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_396.wav|64|Meanwhile, the business of government goes on.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_006.wav|5|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_277.wav|102|Tourism continues to struggle.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_319.wav|104|It is an impressive record.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_148.wav|95|He was a home referee.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_198.wav|3|If that's the case, he will struggle.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_282.wav|69|It was good.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_015.wav|9|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_074.wav|93|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_038.wav|58|This is a big advantage.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_343.wav|72|There wasn't anything in it.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_028.wav|52|The west coast line is not just for middle England.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_243.wav|3|Was everything done to save people ?
DUMMY2/p253/p253_390.wav|70|I've had my time.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_259.wav|49|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_003.wav|20|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_236.wav|48|My Dad is a hero.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_267.wav|59|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_384.wav|42|I'm not sure.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_405.wav|19|The Open champion is back.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_004.wav|68|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_090.wav|101|I did not have a bet on myself.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_150.wav|99|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_037.wav|24|Rugby has an extended run.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_168.wav|16|One season, they might do well.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_334.wav|47|I'd like to take the plunge.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_339.wav|67|Gaelic provision continued to be good.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_343.wav|78|Something is going to have to give.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_266.wav|23|He will be advised by me.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_167.wav|97|I try to be open to experience.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_438.wav|24|National Farmer's Union of Scotland president, Jim Walker, welcomed the new proposals.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_229.wav|51|Three weeks later, he resigned.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_370.wav|72|This was a very tragic accident.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_397.wav|28|My future is in the marathon.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_268.wav|99|I am totally horrified by the sentence.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_373.wav|105|It is unusual.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_027.wav|92|However, the following year the cancer returned.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_094.wav|30|The boat was fully equipped with safety equipment.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_017.wav|39|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_419.wav|49|He is not very big, either.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_146.wav|72|This is a total mystery.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_004.wav|55|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_114.wav|62|Where do you think she is going?
DUMMY2/p282/p282_246.wav|83|It was a hit.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_326.wav|31|My view has now completely changed.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_029.wav|45|We want to ensure that the process is entirely transparent.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_238.wav|12|It is difficult when you don't know anyone.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_323.wav|37|The early physical reports were clear.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_457.wav|50|We think a lot of Allan McGregor.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_094.wav|79|They just have a go.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_310.wav|33|And it had been a marvellous occasion.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_096.wav|12|They told us about it the next day.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_206.wav|76|A contractor was due to be appointed yesterday.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_187.wav|61|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_346.wav|25|The decision is an absolute disgrace.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_051.wav|76|Their conditions are described as serious but stable.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_268.wav|68|It is a difficult thing to explain.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_032.wav|102|The music industry hasn't changed at all.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_118.wav|104|We are the weakest link.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_351.wav|61|It should be scrapped.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_219.wav|66|I am totally devoted to this job.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_215.wav|96|His third goal was superb.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_087.wav|67|Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_355.wav|36|He deserves a top team.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_249.wav|94|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_284.wav|85|The change was not instant.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_127.wav|48|Diversions were put in place.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_347.wav|19|This morning was very quiet.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_470.wav|95|City sentiment is in his favour.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_139.wav|39|The squad is too small.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_189.wav|25|It just came into my head that day.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_399.wav|96|Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_412.wav|56|George is on a two-day visit to Scotland.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_046.wav|16|It is marvellous.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_349.wav|62|Parents should avoid it.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_216.wav|0|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_229.wav|46|It is time for a more honest approach.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_230.wav|19|She asked us a lot of questions.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_084.wav|99|We have other options.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_234.wav|91|Hopefully, it will pay off for me.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_447.wav|95|Something has got to give.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_306.wav|81|I can live with it.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_171.wav|21|It has been handled entirely properly.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_194.wav|96|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_341.wav|75|Finally, he paid for the movie.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_088.wav|49|I came up through the ranks.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_094.wav|65|What is the wife?)
DUMMY2/p232/p232_180.wav|96|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_258.wav|55|It was an accident.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_132.wav|30|Mary Archer is almost too clever.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_333.wav|56|He declined to comment on possible disposals.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_245.wav|26|You can feel at home in China.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_163.wav|86|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_259.wav|47|George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_190.wav|105|We must keep our feet on the ground.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_139.wav|99|It was typical.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_149.wav|49|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_247.wav|67|The perception is that we do not care about social issues.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_161.wav|67|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_066.wav|101|It is a job creation scheme.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_156.wav|4|It's like a high school play.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_203.wav|37|Is our children learning ?
DUMMY2/p244/p244_013.wav|78|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_340.wav|92|It's like a garage.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_204.wav|22|Europe has lost its way under the socialists.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_298.wav|46|I know you went back this morning.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_096.wav|27|This one did.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_267.wav|24|We've had several problems over injuries.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_148.wav|66|In time, may prove a worthy successor to Billy Dodds.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_193.wav|25|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_078.wav|17|Are you watching Liverpool?
DUMMY2/p316/p316_397.wav|85|They are not left wing.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_140.wav|87|The rise in retail sales was the first since August.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_107.wav|68|Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_139.wav|96|I am totally devoted to this job.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_052.wav|73|It's that kind of place.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_316.wav|83|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_214.wav|103|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_422.wav|51|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_181.wav|48|Did it work ?
DUMMY2/p335/p335_266.wav|49|I think we've got the balance right.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_222.wav|26|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_271.wav|72|Are we going to stay up?
DUMMY2/p317/p317_280.wav|97|It was always open for extension.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_313.wav|36|The party lasted all night.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_172.wav|92|You're not going to forget something like that.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_374.wav|100|Is it worth it ?
DUMMY2/p333/p333_021.wav|64|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_387.wav|55|It's clearly a budget.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_259.wav|98|I'm happy that we have agreed.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_194.wav|50|This should put downward pressure on inflation.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_221.wav|23|It will take some time to establish.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_457.wav|24|I think the goalkeeper should have gone.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_174.wav|80|We have a budget in March.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_152.wav|45|Neither side can win this war.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_138.wav|28|Holland won by five wickets.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_357.wav|79|We had no idea what was going on.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_094.wav|71|"The selection process is still at a very early stage."
DUMMY2/p287/p287_251.wav|77|I should think so, too.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_001.wav|90|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_218.wav|41|Saturday is gone.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_123.wav|42|Asylum is an entirely different issue to race.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_152.wav|19|I am ashamed of them.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_399.wav|8|Petrol prices were widely blamed.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_224.wav|57|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_020.wav|88|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_408.wav|51|There is no smoking gun.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_205.wav|23|He doesn't have to like it, but he must accept it.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_134.wav|33|We can play better than that.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_422.wav|17|He also admitted possessing a firearm.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_063.wav|48|Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_008.wav|64|These take the shape of a long round arc, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_300.wav|38|It's a sign of the times.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_109.wav|96|He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_327.wav|62|There is still hope.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_298.wav|0|It is inherent in society.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_377.wav|27|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_208.wav|15|It was crucial strike.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_350.wav|101|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
DUMMY2/p339/p339_119.wav|18|I thought it was quite good.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_219.wav|46|Two and a half million people have died.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_426.wav|7|But the foundations have been laid.)
DUMMY2/p304/p304_217.wav|72|Such actions are rarely popular.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_155.wav|3|We want to get there.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_399.wav|16|I love the thought of having a crack at defending the title.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_336.wav|97|She was charged with perjury.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_390.wav|78|He was on a mission.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_347.wav|55|Those overseas offices were great.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_317.wav|85|It's a real challenge.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_286.wav|35|That was a gold medal for certain.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_147.wav|22|And a mightily impressive recording it is, too.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_348.wav|20|Tell us about it.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_392.wav|41|I would have loved to play in an Old Firm.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_141.wav|49|We haven't seen from the Bank of Scotland.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_158.wav|71|"My Dad is a hero."
DUMMY2/p295/p295_210.wav|92|And what is she escaping from?
DUMMY2/p250/p250_268.wav|24|That was a disgraceful performance.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_028.wav|23|All my training is for Athens.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_056.wav|78|It has been a horrible, horrible time.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_337.wav|36|Does that put pressure on us ?
DUMMY2/p361/p361_192.wav|79|Failure is not an option.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_230.wav|107|Survival is our aim.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_317.wav|3|It is a crisis of human rights, a crisis of leadership.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_340.wav|33|So we talked about that for a bit.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_359.wav|68|I was happiest with my short game.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_107.wav|75|They will notice a difference.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_291.wav|64|It is just too long since the war.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_101.wav|44|The election is total confusion and chaos.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_201.wav|5|I will win.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_019.wav|39|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_362.wav|10|It intends to do so on Wednesday.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_054.wav|74|I certainly think it's very short-sighted.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_281.wav|70|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_307.wav|86|Funding for the science centre has come from a number of sources.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_352.wav|69|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_109.wav|30|Or so it would appear.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_297.wav|56|Is it in the right place ?
DUMMY2/p265/p265_170.wav|73|I've been there.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_032.wav|50|If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_049.wav|86|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_146.wav|1|I never thought it would take this long.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_034.wav|8|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_047.wav|30|They don't take you to mass graves.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_075.wav|26|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_200.wav|96|He's not written as a terribly exciting person in the book.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_084.wav|71|"That will come after the game on Saturday."
DUMMY2/p285/p285_057.wav|2|Scotland had great assets.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_402.wav|106|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
DUMMY2/p252/p252_198.wav|55|The hotel was huge.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_311.wav|39|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_157.wav|72|My goal was very important to the team.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_312.wav|16|The letters are going out today.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_300.wav|61|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_007.wav|15|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_391.wav|92|Our position is not a logic of war.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_389.wav|91|The wealth of talent in Australia is awesome.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_075.wav|102|She opens tonight in Glasgow, at the King's Theatre.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_214.wav|5|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_044.wav|38|There were no passengers on board.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_221.wav|80|We'll have to work hard today.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_147.wav|4|I believe in trade unions.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_054.wav|44|You've got to have everything inside with you.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_305.wav|0|The judge was really nice.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_403.wav|51|Friends of the family have given their support.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_055.wav|21|My mother is a widow.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_310.wav|39|However, a ruling will not come before next week.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_022.wav|30|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of a super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_178.wav|5|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_171.wav|53|You need a long-term strategy in football.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_106.wav|41|The selection process is still at a very early stage.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_100.wav|77|You had better believe it.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_099.wav|73|Now, though, he believes that the new formation has helped his form.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_334.wav|69|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_182.wav|7|If that's the case, he will struggle.)
DUMMY2/p284/p284_002.wav|16|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_252.wav|33|Now we are back on top of Europe.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_313.wav|106|We've had great things in the past.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_142.wav|27|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_114.wav|8|The situation is not easy, but we will prevail.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_207.wav|33|Six years is too long.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_240.wav|106|Is it worth it ?
DUMMY2/p345/p345_122.wav|82|We wanted it left for a wee while.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_346.wav|43|But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_102.wav|68|Next league matches, Dundee United - Kilmarnock.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_130.wav|28|It's about attitudes to change.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_123.wav|10|However, the problem is the timing.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_179.wav|70|The goals were good.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_281.wav|48|Downing Street insisted, We have made clear that the deadline is absolute.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_212.wav|96|He knows a lot.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_040.wav|43|It was clear.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_030.wav|74|We've not won anything yet.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_206.wav|65|This takes no account of hotel and tourism losses.)
DUMMY2/p334/p334_191.wav|38|His English counterpart agreed.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_384.wav|53|What do we do ?
DUMMY2/p284/p284_038.wav|16|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_318.wav|94|It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_077.wav|35|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_192.wav|11|You encourage them - you can do it.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_270.wav|84|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_289.wav|36|It has the potential to be another North Sea.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_087.wav|92|I don't entirely buy that.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_342.wav|37|He is the son of former chairman, Lord Wolfson.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_227.wav|4|Those Were The Days, indeed.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_479.wav|75|Then came the farewell to Europe.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_065.wav|84|Indeed, it is only the beginning.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_088.wav|2|But I was wrong.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_018.wav|62|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_158.wav|73|You had to go and see him.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_297.wav|68|That is a job for the Government.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_063.wav|82|The sleeper was six hours late.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_467.wav|75|It can all be done over the phone.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_015.wav|48|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_216.wav|85|It is too much for me.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_342.wav|23|Mr Blair is the problem in Scotland, not the solution.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_063.wav|63|It seems to have worked.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_348.wav|47|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_380.wav|105|My husband was born in Zimbabwe.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_094.wav|49|Four other charges were dropped.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_340.wav|48|It will affect their work.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_169.wav|37|I can see it now.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_034.wav|9|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_249.wav|93|I am the opposite because I haven't played very much.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_232.wav|0|A small number of new jobs will also be created.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_314.wav|74|I have still to hear about that.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_205.wav|1|Only the scale of change differed.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_134.wav|35|It was a piece of art.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_155.wav|32|The danger is always there.)
DUMMY2/p254/p254_192.wav|41|Is that it?
DUMMY2/p333/p333_121.wav|64|This was dismissed as absolute nonsense.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_079.wav|74|He is now back in Britain.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_186.wav|70|Does this matter?
DUMMY2/p233/p233_347.wav|84|He had played well in that central role.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_130.wav|32|That would open the gates of hell.)
DUMMY2/p225/p225_063.wav|101|Both sides have been hit by injury.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_159.wav|62|The world is being invited to visit.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_311.wav|43|I was concerned with the way they tried to justify his actions.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_161.wav|27|That includes the equipment?
DUMMY2/p300/p300_012.wav|102|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_259.wav|104|A Scotsman has to defend his castle.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_107.wav|31|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_455.wav|14|People are so negative about the whole business.)
DUMMY2/p335/p335_082.wav|49|Its workforce is to be made redundant.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_241.wav|2|If we lose the doctor it would be the last straw.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_278.wav|34|Meantime, his appointment has been widely welcomed.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_111.wav|6|We are making no comment.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_090.wav|3|Why do it otherwise ?
DUMMY2/p271/p271_303.wav|27|They are wrong.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_243.wav|45|Jock Brown is appointed as general manager.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_162.wav|65|It is just too tough.)
DUMMY2/p300/p300_107.wav|102|The culture is extremely widespread and vibrant.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_279.wav|82|The whole thing has been a fantastic experience.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_029.wav|40|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_337.wav|98|Wouldn't it be nice?
DUMMY2/p316/p316_282.wav|85|I just hope it's not tonight against us.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_156.wav|93|The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_165.wav|58|They recorded their debut album in New York.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_300.wav|53|So, did she meet him ?
DUMMY2/p363/p363_397.wav|6|You can't take a chance.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_133.wav|27|Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_045.wav|86|We need to chat.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_046.wav|101|No details of the talks were given.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_270.wav|86|Access has been a nightmare.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_157.wav|48|Before the game we went for a pint.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_449.wav|106|He was released after treatment.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_375.wav|95|My mind is focused on the next four weeks.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_080.wav|90|It is a terrible place.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_453.wav|95|I was embarrassed by it.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_305.wav|45|Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_396.wav|20|It was a breathtaking moment.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_338.wav|100|Both sides have been hit by injury.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_036.wav|88|It was very moving, actually.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_396.wav|46|Completion is expected by October the following year.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_285.wav|83|Who did the recruiting?
DUMMY2/p300/p300_390.wav|102|Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_352.wav|55|No sport needs that sort of thing.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_388.wav|91|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_242.wav|2|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_301.wav|76|They were going through the motions, but that's about all.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_367.wav|87|Corporate banking would be based in Edinburgh.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_051.wav|51|I'm feeling pretty good.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_140.wav|49|Don't even bother applying.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_235.wav|79|That would end it for us.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_337.wav|74|It was a very terrible thing.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_277.wav|93|Access has been a nightmare.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_335.wav|21|We played them off the pitch.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_168.wav|0|I always felt they played for me.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_263.wav|40|That review will look at the management across the sector as a whole.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_284.wav|21|Would they work together again?
DUMMY2/p294/p294_075.wav|104|Until they came to do it.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_004.wav|83|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_185.wav|72|There were so many characters among them.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_369.wav|2|By that time, however, it was already too late.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_235.wav|16|Our policy is clear.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_032.wav|59|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_200.wav|94|We played them off the pitch.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_232.wav|62|That is in the very nature of farming.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_270.wav|85|Feel the heat?
DUMMY2/p287/p287_066.wav|77|There can be no compromise on welfare.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_201.wav|22|Well, what do you know?
DUMMY2/p361/p361_052.wav|79|It doesn't have to be in Inverness.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_412.wav|62|Friday night was a pretty good night.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_191.wav|24|Our fans have been marvellous.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_290.wav|99|IT S all in the hair.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_234.wav|40|Of course I was tempted.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_050.wav|81|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_279.wav|54|He was happy, the BBC was happy, the listeners were happy.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_192.wav|107|I felt we had fallen back a little.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_421.wav|17|So he should be.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_286.wav|63|Analysts had a mixed reaction to the numbers.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_413.wav|77|I remain a buyer of the shares.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_264.wav|17|We have not given up hope.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_163.wav|88|There was nothing anyone could do.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_243.wav|65|Eight months later, he was dead.)
DUMMY2/p308/p308_257.wav|107|It didn't take long.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_152.wav|46|Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_367.wav|25|There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_155.wav|9|I knew he was good.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_116.wav|15|He is involved in everything.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_042.wav|56|I was inspired by two things.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_275.wav|97|I am totally surprised.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_364.wav|79|It's going to happen.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_114.wav|55|So they should be.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_386.wav|75|Clark is back on top form.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_119.wav|26|Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_284.wav|7|It makes no difference to their friendship.)
DUMMY2/p326/p326_140.wav|28|After day one back, he may be revising that opinion already.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_307.wav|64|It's my favourite place to hang out.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_334.wav|45|It could have gone either way.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_180.wav|46|Saddam Hussein has made the case against himself.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_316.wav|78|It involved the same people.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_177.wav|76|Perhaps it is jealousy.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_192.wav|70|We speak about the performance.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_054.wav|48|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_380.wav|31|The casualties were not named.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_386.wav|36|In fact, he was great today.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_390.wav|107|His death was a tragic accident.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_440.wav|24|THIS is a good day for Scottish farming.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_153.wav|10|Its loss was an economic catastrophe for the whole of Moray.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_103.wav|83|Two of the team became ill.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_243.wav|78|The matter is under appeal.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_209.wav|90|But I am a worried man.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_314.wav|19|But they had to be paid for.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_288.wav|60|I have played well the past two days.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_094.wav|62|They thought the set-up there was unfair.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_264.wav|69|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_017.wav|30|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_386.wav|24|Is it worth it ?
DUMMY2/p288/p288_339.wav|47|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_117.wav|35|Which can happen any time.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_325.wav|3|Is there a waiting list ?
DUMMY2/p326/p326_151.wav|28|But what will we put on it?
DUMMY2/p282/p282_250.wav|83|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_178.wav|32|was everything done to save people ?)
DUMMY2/p226/p226_214.wav|43|I'm pleased about one thing.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_373.wav|96|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_065.wav|96|He was popular.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_259.wav|10|You can feel at home in China.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_062.wav|17|We're into that build-up now.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_147.wav|51|There is no such thing.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_283.wav|80|You've got to have both sides.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_404.wav|97|It's only tackling congestion.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_203.wav|59|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_060.wav|36|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_217.wav|9|I began to pray.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_125.wav|88|This means that our programme is quite unusual.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_004.wav|77|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_418.wav|75|I think it's a miracle.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_244.wav|15|We don't want to be too intrusive.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_093.wav|57|However, it did not end that way.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_163.wav|78|Not that the occasion was without restraint.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_164.wav|33|I'm just a piece in the jigsaw.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_168.wav|52|I knew that I needed to lower my ball flight.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_064.wav|36|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_197.wav|65|Is it worth it?)
DUMMY2/p262/p262_245.wav|45|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_218.wav|40|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_289.wav|40|We are not going to forget.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_228.wav|35|He remains a main board director of Royal.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_348.wav|70|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_057.wav|72|I have great respect for all my players.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_037.wav|7|Child benefit will not be affected.)
DUMMY2/p271/p271_207.wav|27|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_381.wav|39|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_282.wav|45|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_310.wav|65|He left pretty quickly.)
DUMMY2/p313/p313_188.wav|76|His manager blamed the referee.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_180.wav|17|What if the confession is, after all, a fake?
DUMMY2/p361/p361_103.wav|79|It could take some time.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_195.wav|38|We may make a short-term appointment.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_121.wav|91|The way they play, it is hard to score against them.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_160.wav|4|At least two women were among those arrested.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_220.wav|38|We must improve our relations with government.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_187.wav|103|What is the truth about the cow?
DUMMY2/p267/p267_384.wav|0|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_033.wav|33|As a schoolteacher he was an excellent coach.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_145.wav|5|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_284.wav|72|He called for a public inquiry.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_068.wav|25|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_005.wav|90|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_108.wav|34|I've had a very long run.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_180.wav|106|It was a sobering experience.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_301.wav|32|And we were very lucky.)
DUMMY2/p244/p244_216.wav|78|However, Murray Johnstone is not on the menu.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_059.wav|93|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_210.wav|49|John Lennon is a very large industry.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_402.wav|76|This fight is not going to go away.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_186.wav|106|The festivals will be about having fun.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_403.wav|26|My house was shaking at the time.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_044.wav|11|Does that put pressure on us?
DUMMY2/p316/p316_207.wav|85|Both men were uninjured.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_341.wav|33|But he has strong links to Labour.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_185.wav|22|You can say he gets a sizeable amount.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_317.wav|38|It seems a little short to me.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_244.wav|30|I'm back playing football, which is what it's all about.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_050.wav|67|We need to chat.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_199.wav|103|I have a theory.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_290.wav|92|Charges against the pair were found not proven.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_393.wav|48|Do I have a favourite ?
DUMMY2/p276/p276_042.wav|106|He is married with three children.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_338.wav|96|The team for the first game could be this one.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_246.wav|53|I think, therefore I am ?
DUMMY2/p280/p280_176.wav|52|Finally, we decided to put the whole speech in.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_367.wav|1|I think we finished fifth.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_135.wav|44|I first met him last summer.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_265.wav|59|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_290.wav|94|You've got to have both sides.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_082.wav|53|It's been a great evening for us.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_406.wav|103|I want a free vote.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_024.wav|6|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_233.wav|91|Its workforce is to be made redundant.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_154.wav|12|Does that put pressure on us?
DUMMY2/p313/p313_284.wav|76|It's funny how it comes and goes.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_279.wav|43|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_117.wav|96|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_045.wav|8|That was the theory, anyway.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_082.wav|10|He said a change in legislation was long overdue.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_304.wav|35|I was there five months ago.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_150.wav|23|We have no idea what caused the derailment.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_151.wav|68|It is always the same, isn't it?
DUMMY2/p294/p294_114.wav|104|The industry will try to get round it.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_119.wav|81|It is rubbish.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_180.wav|67|The post will be unpaid.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_291.wav|87|When she went off it was quite amazing.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_026.wav|101|How are you, sir ?
DUMMY2/p318/p318_135.wav|19|I mean it happens.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_159.wav|101|Neither side can win this war.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_182.wav|26|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_129.wav|28|This is not a long-term commitment.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_211.wav|80|Ferguson should take note.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_175.wav|72|I think that's a bit of an invasion.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_379.wav|60|It meant a lot to us.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_172.wav|47|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_250.wav|73|We have to expand.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_039.wav|104|He got the same story.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_200.wav|7|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.)
DUMMY2/p294/p294_393.wav|104|Nine days later, he suffered another attack.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_455.wav|65|They thought he was asking the right questions.)
DUMMY2/p306/p306_123.wav|12|This is not understood by people outside.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_095.wav|3|By then, he was walking on water.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_075.wav|47|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_374.wav|39|However, the appeal judges rejected the argument.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_254.wav|48|She replied, It could be.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_354.wav|20|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_072.wav|32|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?)
DUMMY2/p313/p313_268.wav|76|They just thought it was extremely good acting.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_383.wav|19|It's always the same, isn't it?
DUMMY2/p347/p347_269.wav|46|How much of a cop out is that?
DUMMY2/p231/p231_163.wav|50|What do we want to do that for ?
DUMMY2/p249/p249_287.wav|80|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_144.wav|53|They can break quickly from midfield and carry a scoring threat.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_281.wav|24|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_068.wav|28|Everyone could see it apart from Kevin Keegan.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_330.wav|17|It is a high time to act.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_189.wav|27|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_334.wav|13|This country has many challenges.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_083.wav|99|New Zealand rugby is totally different.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_037.wav|5|They're just different.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_303.wav|17|And there is no cause for it.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_014.wav|47|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_016.wav|83|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_083.wav|98|Would you have ever believed that was possible?
DUMMY2/p306/p306_299.wav|12|They finished second and third.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_106.wav|76|However, he added there were signs of progress.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_149.wav|3|Full consent is expected by the end of next year.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_160.wav|29|Seven people were later detained by police.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_277.wav|72|My Dad is a hero.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_281.wav|107|We've taken steps to rectify it.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_027.wav|75|Meetings will also remain private.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_324.wav|105|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_078.wav|13|THERE's only one word for it.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_166.wav|3|At the moment we do not understand it.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_313.wav|25|Special measures were needed.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_193.wav|53|It involved everything in terms of behaviour.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_161.wav|40|It was by the numbers.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_234.wav|28|There are no easy solutions to this problem.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_449.wav|39|The second goal was a terrible mistake by our defence.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_031.wav|100|I have never been a member of the council.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_427.wav|40|He deserved a red card.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_335.wav|23|They had asked not to be named.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_428.wav|65|I have to protect them.)
DUMMY2/p248/p248_179.wav|99|Tony had arrived.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_194.wav|15|Last year, it was won by Jack McConnell, the first minister.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_153.wav|103|Northern Ireland is a society divided by religion.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_154.wav|77|The people are the hero.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_281.wav|49|Government sources said, It is building up.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_112.wav|16|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_274.wav|8|Or was it ?
DUMMY2/p326/p326_368.wav|28|It's hard not to.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_064.wav|24|Companies are now seeking to recover their losses.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_367.wav|52|The dead woman and the injured man have not yet been named.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_057.wav|98|The crackdown is launched today by the government.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_144.wav|88|I don't entirely buy that.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_092.wav|67|It is an old family habit.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_349.wav|89|We will be homeless.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_051.wav|79|They were taken to prove a point.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_092.wav|87|In fact, I have even had a bet on them.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_206.wav|48|My wife and family are the support system.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_153.wav|45|He can do no wrong.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_144.wav|90|It changed my life.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_197.wav|82|There is no way to do this.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_065.wav|102|His rival's are spoken with elan.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_001.wav|71|"Please call Stella.  "
DUMMY2/p247/p247_427.wav|14|My aim is a top six finish.)
DUMMY2/p313/p313_255.wav|76|Our people are paying high prices.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_353.wav|63|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_434.wav|36|We might be back next year.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_007.wav|27|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_166.wav|32|They had been forced to walk.)
DUMMY2/p326/p326_121.wav|28|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_103.wav|56|We deserve a significant rise.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_278.wav|92|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_004.wav|38|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_148.wav|39|I never wanted a legal battle.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_265.wav|12|Holland won by five wickets.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_092.wav|49|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_145.wav|75|We will provide immediate access.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_027.wav|58|It is only one night, after all.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_211.wav|63|Mr Blair was ready for him.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_298.wav|82|This could prove a problem.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_030.wav|19|We have to put this behind us.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_406.wav|65|The songs are just so good.)
DUMMY2/p326/p326_191.wav|28|I feel really good.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_376.wav|98|At this point we can only speculate.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_421.wav|97|We do not, at the moment, have a shortage.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_119.wav|105|I'm delighted about that.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_013.wav|98|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_020.wav|4|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_326.wav|21|It is time, he said.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_290.wav|107|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_418.wav|18|I thought they could have made the gesture.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_297.wav|53|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_067.wav|19|Sandy was very active.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_219.wav|100|They have known the hard times.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_019.wav|106|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_150.wav|93|It's amazing, but I have never seen a drug test in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_132.wav|11|It had been in place since last July.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_023.wav|95|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_137.wav|27|My daughter is an adult.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_370.wav|43|Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_238.wav|91|We wanted it left for a wee while.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_037.wav|57|Indeed, he does.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_175.wav|2|It is not either national standards or local control.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_134.wav|36|I never wanted a legal battle.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_001.wav|2|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_108.wav|97|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_107.wav|35|It is a total and utter change of culture.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_155.wav|16|He was asked to quit.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_074.wav|72|Smuggling is an increasing problem for the Government.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_003.wav|31|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_254.wav|91|The final stage is paranoia.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_397.wav|68|The pressure was now back on Mr Arafat.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_014.wav|98|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_079.wav|83|People must remain vigilant.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_370.wav|50|This is a major championship.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_121.wav|50|I was just a child.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_245.wav|74|I should think so, too.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_240.wav|61|You take a risk.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_087.wav|59|The reason is to do with the nature of the Scotland manager.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_188.wav|89|Peace was won.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_252.wav|60|But it was too late.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_287.wav|62|In the end, that was enough to beat England.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_380.wav|17|I joined a group.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_219.wav|28|We're playing away from home and that's it.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_269.wav|51|They've been at it for five hours.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_060.wav|44|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_181.wav|66|That's how it worked in Bosnia.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_186.wav|52|A great player has to win major championships.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_189.wav|48|Millions of British jobs depend on Europe.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_313.wav|18|No-one can take it in.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_335.wav|19|I didn't want to fall out with anyone.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_131.wav|37|This is a sizeable part of our business.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_063.wav|36|The standard is extremely high.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_309.wav|46|Surely it can do better than that?
DUMMY2/p230/p230_368.wav|35|Like his acting, it was an accident.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_038.wav|8|The staff are as good as any staff in the city.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_241.wav|15|But we are working together for this result.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_052.wav|93|The Yugoslav president said he did not recognise the election outcome.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_403.wav|40|It might be.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_110.wav|56|I came here this week to work.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_082.wav|62|It was all very proper and civilised.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_278.wav|26|It's a way of life.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_138.wav|3|And does it ?
DUMMY2/p299/p299_314.wav|58|She was just that sort of person.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_249.wav|50|This ruling is a farce.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_082.wav|3|However, a ruling will not come before next week.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_387.wav|105|So I did.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_283.wav|47|Who will perform?
DUMMY2/p334/p334_322.wav|38|Then it developed into civil and criminal.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_027.wav|57|Because we do not need it.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_206.wav|43|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_298.wav|17|We had no part in it.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_317.wav|10|Holland won by five wickets.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_212.wav|89|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_447.wav|48|Hard cash is needed now.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_256.wav|22|Wanger was never like this.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_288.wav|20|She is an expert on medical ethics.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_183.wav|71|"I saw military vehicles in the distance."
DUMMY2/p308/p308_316.wav|107|Is that Titanic?
DUMMY2/p282/p282_308.wav|83|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_043.wav|92|It's just not our biggest problem.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_213.wav|54|My only ambition is to enjoy my work.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_195.wav|101|It is hard to tell.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_205.wav|4|Our message was inclusive.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_238.wav|64|It's something we want to make work.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_156.wav|69|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_002.wav|38|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_085.wav|84|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
DUMMY2/p266/p266_154.wav|20|They have not been named.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_176.wav|28|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_181.wav|68|We aren't going to play better.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_252.wav|107|We could have got three medals.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_108.wav|89|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_204.wav|16|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_262.wav|78|So far, the problems have occurred in the US.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_396.wav|23|I should never have come over to Fife.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_104.wav|8|I'm delighted for everyone at Stirling.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_310.wav|50|McNaughton was not so sure.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_173.wav|29|They made such decisions in London.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_234.wav|64|Nobody can change it overnight, but you can make a start.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_203.wav|19|This is not a European Army.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_068.wav|74|It is time for the talking to stop.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_281.wav|98|There is no easy answer.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_412.wav|47|That may be.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_107.wav|49|They receive a high profile in the media.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_248.wav|103|We certainly did enough to win it, but didn't.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_283.wav|63|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_135.wav|49|These awards will deliver improvements on the ground.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_351.wav|4|It is physical but it is also good.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_406.wav|35|We're obviously disturbed by this case.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_343.wav|77|In the old days, it was easy.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_168.wav|99|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_262.wav|69|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_123.wav|29|So what is the campaign about ?
DUMMY2/p284/p284_084.wav|16|They lived for their children.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_119.wav|100|Structural changes were also required.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_169.wav|0|It is premature to speculate on the impact.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_128.wav|46|A young Briton had a lucky escape.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_112.wav|70|Is that right?
DUMMY2/p243/p243_208.wav|53|Gas production was also at record levels last year.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_190.wav|65|The questions came quick and fast.)
DUMMY2/p269/p269_180.wav|94|It was a great achievement to win at Wembley.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_190.wav|47|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_089.wav|71|"The oil companies would be asked to contribute."
DUMMY2/p318/p318_165.wav|19|Golf is a game of honour and ethics.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_074.wav|36|The players will be down.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_354.wav|0|Some will be deployed on submarines.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_174.wav|31|They will do their own thing.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_200.wav|61|It is a case of taking a risk.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_401.wav|74|There was much to be positive about.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_357.wav|0|It is a stroke of genius.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_300.wav|62|I have fallen in love with the Highlands.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_059.wav|46|Yesterday her family were too upset to speak.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_036.wav|27|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_147.wav|77|These days are long gone.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_189.wav|43|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_201.wav|18|We're all paying for it.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_313.wav|43|The minister is the engineer.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_244.wav|67|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_353.wav|82|It was a very big win for us.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_047.wav|29|The casting of her husband was an accident.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_013.wav|54|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_263.wav|91|We are trying to clarify the issues.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_141.wav|45|I've got to hold my own hands up for this one.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_222.wav|17|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_173.wav|103|They had previously been on five-day notice.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_315.wav|96|Kids are terrible.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_272.wav|14|Do you think we are a top nation ?)
DUMMY2/p339/p339_043.wav|18|I said to him.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_359.wav|41|His legal adviser was also not in court yesterday.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_204.wav|56|The statement contained no surprises.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_405.wav|70|Until they came to do it.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_182.wav|10|The outcome is now in our own hands.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_059.wav|27|It is unique.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_009.wav|53|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_099.wav|80|However, it did not end that way.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_333.wav|66|Lambert will be playing against Belgium.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_279.wav|19|Why should he go anywhere?
DUMMY2/p333/p333_053.wav|64|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_088.wav|3|Do I have a favourite ?
DUMMY2/p274/p274_373.wav|32|After the match, do you ?)
DUMMY2/p272/p272_309.wav|69|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_030.wav|45|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_378.wav|63|Finally came the moment of truth.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_069.wav|83|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_016.wav|4|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_166.wav|79|Those are difficult decisions.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_030.wav|40|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_141.wav|87|Colin said, You get through the day-to-day by looking at the future.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_348.wav|16|A great deal has been achieved.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_157.wav|91|We don't just play golf in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_120.wav|79|I am not very pleased.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_012.wav|107|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_198.wav|48|He said the director had been completely friendly.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_339.wav|82|Mr Straw was home secretary at the time.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_120.wav|37|Are they free ?
DUMMY2/p233/p233_174.wav|84|It's that sort of night.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_230.wav|2|They tried to give her advice.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_205.wav|20|It had all been arranged.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_326.wav|49|This is a national crisis.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_343.wav|42|The girls are ready to compete.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_267.wav|22|I do not own the vessel in question.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_341.wav|8|There was some merit in that.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_223.wav|40|Saturday is gone.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_322.wav|106|I saw them last week.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_032.wav|65|He added that her comments were noted.)
DUMMY2/p300/p300_002.wav|102|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_159.wav|99|A Labour insider said it was far too close to call.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_244.wav|79|Sadly it is a mess.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_259.wav|73|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_175.wav|99|Blair's response was weak.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_019.wav|93|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_277.wav|107|This is not, however, a General Election reshuffle.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_144.wav|21|But not all were so defiant.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_318.wav|47|They wanted the club to make money.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_182.wav|27|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_182.wav|34|He was married with children.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_214.wav|82|It happens in real life.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_082.wav|8|Potions said he would drive.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_310.wav|78|In the UK, inflation data will be published this morning.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_193.wav|8|They were seriously after him.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_214.wav|99|It had all been arranged.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_011.wav|37|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_166.wav|84|She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_243.wav|37|It is crucial for both teams.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_435.wav|39|We know about the crisis in cattle.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_144.wav|39|The temperature in the town is very difficult to control.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_283.wav|17|We're going to change our party.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_220.wav|32|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.)
DUMMY2/p231/p231_034.wav|50|That means an extra two years.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_379.wav|13|That's not like us at all.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_002.wav|41|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_119.wav|22|It is not great art.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_199.wav|26|But she might be.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_245.wav|80|We have spent the last couple of years with acting directors.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_037.wav|23|I have got to adopt the same approach.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_392.wav|98|I was living with my mum.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_326.wav|93|It is out there.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_050.wav|59|Who can say?
DUMMY2/p292/p292_175.wav|13|He is the example for all of us.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_126.wav|52|So I am going in the right direction.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_320.wav|38|His replacement was named yesterday, following inquiries by The Herald.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_064.wav|1|One, the Acute Services Trust, will run the general hospital services.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_370.wav|15|Plot is not the issue.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_285.wav|107|Others said they had been beaten by police.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_107.wav|71|"We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail."
DUMMY2/p245/p245_115.wav|59|Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_454.wav|36|This is the stuff of live music.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_008.wav|88|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_311.wav|73|The party is up for it.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_355.wav|99|That would help.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_181.wav|33|She didn't tell me anything the night before.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_270.wav|69|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_363.wav|68|Would he be able to live with that?
DUMMY2/p323/p323_288.wav|34|We need to increase the membership.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_420.wav|79|We certainly do not intend to disband.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_232.wav|98|It's not a party, no, no.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_024.wav|94|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_041.wav|83|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_286.wav|30|The new system will be marketed this summer.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_390.wav|34|There is great interest on our island.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_284.wav|63|They must play for each other.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_161.wav|106|They said so that I would look good in uniform.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_388.wav|29|There is no deal as yet.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_224.wav|100|IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_002.wav|57|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_478.wav|7|You have to have a proven track record to get them.)
DUMMY2/p261/p261_217.wav|100|It was far from business as usual.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_165.wav|0|Well, this article is a bit like that.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_181.wav|97|I'll just do my best.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_367.wav|4|Our Great Depression is our lives.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_105.wav|52|I bought a flat six years ago.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_340.wav|97|Stewart will travel with some confidence.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_197.wav|31|I cannot say too much about them.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_315.wav|17|Most people know that.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_159.wav|33|The whole thing in general is moving on.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_252.wav|24|The most important thing is the game.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_267.wav|50|Did he trip ?
DUMMY2/p300/p300_163.wav|102|I took a minibus into town.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_232.wav|14|We played them off the pitch.)
DUMMY2/p326/p326_066.wav|28|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_280.wav|16|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_312.wav|3|And we can do it.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_377.wav|53|The direct effects on trade will be limited.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_316.wav|95|We have to be very, very careful.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_228.wav|39|We can hardly talk about it.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_187.wav|62|We played too deeply.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_232.wav|33|Perhaps that was their mistake.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_389.wav|29|In due course the deal was done.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_189.wav|4|Who do you think you are?
DUMMY2/p343/p343_179.wav|21|This has been very frustrating for him.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_302.wav|16|One was a lawyer.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_160.wav|99|They are expected to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court today.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_193.wav|22|He scored one goal and was on fire.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_172.wav|107|And now he tells us.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_192.wav|42|We've never seen so many.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_052.wav|16|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_491.wav|48|It's unlikely to be renewed.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_456.wav|89|If they don't, they should say so.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_228.wav|37|Arnie ignores the suggestion that he has ever been anywhere else.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_161.wav|20|Was this element always there?
DUMMY2/p333/p333_223.wav|64|Two and a half million people have died.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_462.wav|7|We put our bid in last night.)
DUMMY2/p232/p232_377.wav|96|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_167.wav|84|Neither side can win this war.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_288.wav|71|"He should have won."
DUMMY2/p246/p246_083.wav|5|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_143.wav|100|The balance isn't there at EMI.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_406.wav|91|Jackson may well be right.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_151.wav|95|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_319.wav|58|It was chaotic and frightening.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_122.wav|96|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_299.wav|1|Motion described it as a unique event.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_228.wav|81|The parties have been given until today to respond.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_265.wav|98|There is no point in denying that.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_380.wav|103|I never agreed with that.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_299.wav|57|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_332.wav|99|It will be very, very tight.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_386.wav|104|I told her, and she was extremely grateful.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_272.wav|3|We want this place to work.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_049.wav|33|He met his wife and married in England.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_125.wav|102|Wallace was a prisoner of war.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_320.wav|94|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_159.wav|16|These days are long gone.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_226.wav|35|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_291.wav|76|It's never over until it's over.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_421.wav|46|Officials say the city must achieve this.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_060.wav|63|We would have concerns about suspension.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_128.wav|103|The trial is set for February.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_024.wav|101|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_382.wav|60|This country has many challenges.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_300.wav|91|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_359.wav|92|You are always aware of the injury potential.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_018.wav|95|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_065.wav|30|It is just part of modern day life.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_115.wav|89|I am just trying to do my job.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_400.wav|15|You hope he prevails.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_327.wav|64|But she's also beautiful behind the face.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_172.wav|35|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_014.wav|19|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_468.wav|39|It's been a long, long journey.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_414.wav|62|The proposals have been taken out of context.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_271.wav|76|I expect a rapid response.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_137.wav|85|He is a bully.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_035.wav|92|After that, it's a step into the unknown.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_315.wav|51|We are now setting about finding them.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_297.wav|76|What's the point of staying sober?
DUMMY2/p250/p250_150.wav|24|It was finally agreed on Saturday.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_031.wav|75|He was jailed for four years.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_192.wav|80|Miller was every bit as happy.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_409.wav|24|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_168.wav|73|Almost the day after the election, the battle lines were drawn.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_198.wav|16|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_161.wav|76|I can make one further announcement.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_095.wav|91|I have no plans to change the oath.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_334.wav|39|There is no plan B.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_258.wav|62|The claim was denied by first minister.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_161.wav|17|Jonny Wilkinson had an off-day on Saturday.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_189.wav|55|I've never had a year like this.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_351.wav|65|He is fully fit.)
DUMMY2/p280/p280_250.wav|52|He has many offers from the English Premiership.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_311.wav|3|It has to be enforced.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_225.wav|49|Come to that, is any of this really happening?
DUMMY2/p255/p255_024.wav|31|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_293.wav|102|As agreed, the prime minister was driven to Westminster Hall.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_409.wav|64|Home is in the Scottish Borders.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_054.wav|39|Both banks are heavily involved in the Scottish market.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_302.wav|36|Scotch beef is badly missed.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_377.wav|98|We know we have the quality.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_210.wav|47|The second is the reaction of the Hibs fans.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_393.wav|32|The law would appear to be on our side.)
DUMMY2/p249/p249_310.wav|80|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_231.wav|12|We have tried to keep his head up.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_022.wav|28|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_258.wav|84|There will be tough opponents to this report.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_193.wav|24|They need to look after themselves.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_278.wav|53|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_336.wav|99|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_098.wav|38|And also, whatever he does, can he really win?
DUMMY2/p261/p261_091.wav|100|We could not get any possession.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_071.wav|14|Final proposals will be published in February.)
DUMMY2/p276/p276_351.wav|106|It was worth a photograph.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_392.wav|36|I had a fortunate war.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_197.wav|90|I wanted to put myself on the line.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_381.wav|69|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_120.wav|107|Britain may now be forced to listen.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_076.wav|33|His track record is impressive.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_210.wav|53|We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_046.wav|48|But not a penny has been paid.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_244.wav|68|All were later allowed home.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_235.wav|23|There is a great carry over value.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_106.wav|70|Oil embargo endorsed.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_082.wav|37|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_329.wav|80|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_135.wav|27|It was very frightened and dirty.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_141.wav|26|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_301.wav|24|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_370.wav|69|I've never seen a game like it.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_171.wav|40|Seven people were later detained by police.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_300.wav|98|Beyond that would have been outrageous.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_327.wav|32|Is it worth it ?)
DUMMY2/p301/p301_195.wav|91|Harold is a rarity.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_065.wav|52|Indeed he has a lot of output.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_144.wav|58|We would welcome a greater emphasis on carcasses.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_118.wav|81|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_317.wav|15|He is firm but inclusive and very fair.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_083.wav|1|Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_123.wav|28|That is a data management problem.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_353.wav|15|The incident is dead.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_465.wav|39|It was another reminder of the power of an image.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_499.wav|48|I am not unduly surprised.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_350.wav|26|It is long gone.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_290.wav|20|Who did the recruiting?
DUMMY2/p256/p256_097.wav|90|They've got to account for it.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_173.wav|10|What happened in that game ?
DUMMY2/p313/p313_354.wav|76|Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_185.wav|107|Reviving the Scottish Open is one option.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_157.wav|51|It's all too short term.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_035.wav|88|It shouldn't be a problem.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_295.wav|104|They've got a mountain to climb.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_272.wav|76|There was still more disquiet in Israel.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_243.wav|99|She is well balanced.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_353.wav|64|By social devices, the two groups are coming together.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_330.wav|83|I've got no secret.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_146.wav|23|Perhaps it should stay there.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_239.wav|27|We are so proud.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_472.wav|39|It's just a place to open it.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_418.wav|16|It is legally binding.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_043.wav|51|I'm delighted with how he has come through.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_029.wav|61|The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_051.wav|69|It is bizarre.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_092.wav|35|He was prepared for this.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_240.wav|2|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_033.wav|70|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_403.wav|96|My house was shaking at the time.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_186.wav|30|They have two children.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_283.wav|14|They must play for each other.)
DUMMY2/p336/p336_412.wav|98|He wants the festival to make a difference.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_146.wav|91|You hope he prevails.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_379.wav|74|It feels like a winner already.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_296.wav|93|It's like a high school play.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_305.wav|67|There is no openness.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_395.wav|69|It was a breathtaking moment.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_292.wav|74|It is set in Paris.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_082.wav|71|"It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats."
DUMMY2/p304/p304_380.wav|72|It is not the message alone.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_419.wav|56|That's been all around Europe with me.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_237.wav|59|We did not compete with any other local farmer.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_291.wav|29|It was an easy decision to come here.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_354.wav|55|Any increase always has some effect.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_380.wav|27|That's the name of the game, though.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_146.wav|34|Boy is the town a mess.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_302.wav|76|I can feel the sound inside.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_047.wav|13|Structural changes were also required.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_055.wav|3|I've never been one for complaining about the press.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_260.wav|76|I read it every year.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_318.wav|3|The existing structure is in trouble.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_095.wav|102|The mood is upbeat.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_161.wav|26|It's that sort of night.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_035.wav|5|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_119.wav|8|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_220.wav|51|She was an only child.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_375.wav|49|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_168.wav|46|Not everyone, however, was pleased with the proposed changes.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_417.wav|20|The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_135.wav|51|Her advice for Glasgow is just be visionary.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_200.wav|65|At half-time he was presented to both teams.)
DUMMY2/p225/p225_116.wav|101|Yesterday the company reported a further downturn in profits.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_289.wav|20|It was good.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_140.wav|51|I would love it.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_208.wav|42|Eight new hospitals are set to be built.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_045.wav|81|Among them are many criminals.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_277.wav|39|The property is owned by Glasgow City Council.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_035.wav|58|Nine of the tourists were killed instantly.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_074.wav|71|"She died in hospital two hours later."
DUMMY2/p334/p334_391.wav|38|Golf is an expensive game for beginners.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_188.wav|92|She is still very poorly.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_314.wav|52|He felt too close to head office.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_274.wav|6|His funeral is not expected until next week.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_300.wav|8|We would hope to make progress on that next year.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_330.wav|54|Nato would ensure they could return home, he said.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_195.wav|75|As many as the market will support.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_035.wav|45|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_320.wav|8|Are you going to win ?
DUMMY2/p361/p361_078.wav|79|As it should be.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_174.wav|32|Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.)
DUMMY2/p249/p249_062.wav|80|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_281.wav|25|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_120.wav|19|The Tory party will last.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_295.wav|39|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_164.wav|5|Again, we were lucky.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_139.wav|18|How can they tell?
DUMMY2/p278/p278_132.wav|10|Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_424.wav|18|Which, in effect, it is.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_075.wav|20|Even the one she loved.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_155.wav|33|This was a very tragic accident.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_187.wav|64|The feeling between the two men was mutual.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_259.wav|105|It's very nice.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_347.wav|74|It was like someone had died.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_060.wav|87|They desperately want some stability.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_175.wav|66|Of course he is.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_353.wav|48|What happened in that game ?
DUMMY2/p246/p246_236.wav|5|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_247.wav|44|We're into that build-up now.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_343.wav|81|He has to learn.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_052.wav|87|Marconi is struggling against terrible market forces.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_227.wav|73|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_103.wav|64|Maybe he will act again.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_047.wav|45|It has been a horrible, horrible time.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_321.wav|13|Special measures were needed.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_085.wav|68|We really need research to help with that.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_119.wav|35|But this time we can have no excuses.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_131.wav|81|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_216.wav|52|I am not going to judge them.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_256.wav|59|I was happily surprised.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_126.wav|1|It's like a high school play.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_018.wav|18|Aristotle thought the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_365.wav|60|She has never been back.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_034.wav|60|For once he was wrong.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_070.wav|94|I was just trying to win the golf tournament.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_432.wav|14|It was a breathtaking moment.)
DUMMY2/p240/p240_056.wav|93|He had no enemies.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_002.wav|19|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_192.wav|26|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_448.wav|48|Her housekeeper discovered the break-in on Thursday morning.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_312.wav|2|Henman has been warned.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_150.wav|33|Bin Laden is believed to be left-handed.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_349.wav|55|Maybe she is right.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_225.wav|25|I am immensely sad.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_033.wav|13|Or it's not really for us, if you like.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_341.wav|19|The picture is the same across Scotland.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_153.wav|34|It is a very disturbing picture for men.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_198.wav|21|Well, you can have a tree.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_383.wav|4|Thankfully, that doesn't happen that often.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_084.wav|102|Why did they let him go?
DUMMY2/p250/p250_087.wav|24|They lived for their children.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_386.wav|98|Taxes may need to rise.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_168.wav|24|The defender made an impressive debut.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_385.wav|25|He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_382.wav|33|They were just too good for us.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_337.wav|79|What a difference a game can make.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_079.wav|62|The goal will come.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_106.wav|17|It wasn't a conscious decision not to shout.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_101.wav|27|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_313.wav|10|Mr Campbell received a phone call.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_117.wav|74|We have got to the top.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_304.wav|104|Could it have been better spent?
DUMMY2/p360/p360_420.wav|60|Tiger is the exception.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_008.wav|53|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_090.wav|103|Slater was fortunate to be wearing a helmet.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_228.wav|83|My wife and family are the support system.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_305.wav|34|I spoke with just one player, but not the others.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_152.wav|71|"The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight."
DUMMY2/p376/p376_188.wav|71|"Suddenly, the rugby world had changed."
DUMMY2/p255/p255_241.wav|31|It is mainstream.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_013.wav|35|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_335.wav|17|There was barely a handful of chances.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_403.wav|46|I get very excited by that.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_159.wav|25|It is an attitude of mind.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_263.wav|75|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_141.wav|35|It has to be an event.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_211.wav|13|People have no chance of getting out.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_007.wav|9|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_247.wav|84|The salary changes are long overdue.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_266.wav|64|Mary Archer is almost too clever.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_056.wav|63|People come to see the Highlands.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_349.wav|2|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_204.wav|104|They should not be blamed for it.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_318.wav|64|However, the referee was not in the giving vein.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_009.wav|82|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_078.wav|76|We are confident of taking that back.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_144.wav|59|A Labour insider said it was far too close to call.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_017.wav|78|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_212.wav|87|People have been wonderful beyond belief.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_159.wav|79|It's a mixture of everything.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_219.wav|23|He is, indeed, the grandson of travelling folk.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_315.wav|9|A new school will be built.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_056.wav|100|We will pay their bills.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_032.wav|51|It was not the greatest performance, but it was effective.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_069.wav|104|It makes for an interesting conference.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_146.wav|54|My future is in the marathon.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_319.wav|4|It's a big challenge for the audience.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_252.wav|16|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_445.wav|27|They were not even allowed to see them.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_360.wav|2|This is a club on the rise.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_131.wav|5|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_059.wav|8|The City welcomed the brighter outlook.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_151.wav|53|Does that put pressure on us ?
DUMMY2/p256/p256_112.wav|90|They will want to perform well.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_247.wav|14|I am not going to go tomorrow.)
DUMMY2/p339/p339_224.wav|18|What's it about?
DUMMY2/p255/p255_376.wav|31|Colour was at the core of his life.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_213.wav|56|Investors were also concerned about margin pressure.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_158.wav|91|That's why the young musicians have joined.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_106.wav|59|Who would be a referee?
DUMMY2/p227/p227_283.wav|29|Every one is a winner.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_343.wav|33|I am a doctor.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_026.wav|36|They are very clever in their use of words.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_081.wav|24|It makes for an interesting conference.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_062.wav|100|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_320.wav|22|I'm very pleased with what we have achieved.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_085.wav|18|I had a fortunate war.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_120.wav|30|Britain may now be forced to listen.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_220.wav|28|He was then replaced by Ross.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_232.wav|10|It was finally agreed on Saturday.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_297.wav|29|It's called the Supreme Court for a reason.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_344.wav|45|That is the very reason why it was so vital.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_258.wav|43|That's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_152.wav|31|It is not just about pay.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_360.wav|85|I'm sure that clubs will all be delighted.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_289.wav|30|We also hope to meet the Ulster Unionists.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_151.wav|69|So I got a blood test.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_323.wav|102|I don't know what he was capable of.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_239.wav|59|There wasn't a goal.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_130.wav|71|"We had a great time when we came with Easy Rider."
DUMMY2/p278/p278_263.wav|10|Reaction from Scottish business leaders was mixed.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_117.wav|17|We want to get to the final, anyway.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_153.wav|90|It was by the numbers.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_398.wav|41|Eriksson would have approved.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_266.wav|35|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_046.wav|54|They receive a high profile in the media.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_049.wav|56|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
DUMMY2/p308/p308_211.wav|107|This is a one-year deal, but who knows?
DUMMY2/p237/p237_078.wav|61|It is a terrible place.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_322.wav|16|The election is total confusion and chaos.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_165.wav|85|It's got to be in the head.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_335.wav|103|The new work will begin in the autumn.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_160.wav|1|A report will be issued by March.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_269.wav|71|"People have no choice."
DUMMY2/p336/p336_272.wav|98|The BBC was a disgrace.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_482.wav|75|Winning a medal is a dream.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_183.wav|68|Two men have been charged with his murder.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_129.wav|5|We work well together.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_061.wav|65|So, did she meet him?)
DUMMY2/p347/p347_338.wav|46|It should have a health warning - it is addictive.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_093.wav|90|That will come after the game on Saturday.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_103.wav|35|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_351.wav|9|We haven't had any adverse reaction to the project.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_005.wav|107|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_155.wav|90|We will turn the corner.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_164.wav|29|There is no signature on this document.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_048.wav|40|Every aspect of our play was first class.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_083.wav|65|Now comes the hard part.)
DUMMY2/p292/p292_400.wav|13|Life is about people, and how you feel about people.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_198.wav|24|We represent a wide range of society.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_028.wav|64|Eating was a nightmare, and it wasn't possible to sleep.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_010.wav|95|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_011.wav|86|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_144.wav|93|I am just trying to do my job.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_231.wav|15|Jacques Chirac, the French president, was surely in his sights.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_176.wav|3|I was in a hole.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_038.wav|106|She is employed on short-term contracts.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_142.wav|2|Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_080.wav|28|It was extremely cold.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_360.wav|68|We've got no plans with regard to recording, but who knows?
DUMMY2/p285/p285_395.wav|2|It will take place in July.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_090.wav|73|Journalists should make him.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_417.wav|76|Sightings were replaced by rumours.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_359.wav|22|It won't happen overnight, but things will get better.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_023.wav|44|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_398.wav|100|I wanted to go out on a high.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_205.wav|14|The early physical reports were clear.)
DUMMY2/p253/p253_085.wav|70|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
DUMMY2/p257/p257_077.wav|105|People must remain vigilant.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_283.wav|62|We could do a lot worse.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_187.wav|68|Our people should be immune.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_075.wav|62|Were they under-age?
DUMMY2/p295/p295_113.wav|92|It offers a different viewpoint.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_173.wav|30|Now, though, he is back playing superbly for Blackburn.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_318.wav|26|It should be equal.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_367.wav|95|I'd like to take the plunge.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_240.wav|100|Of course, that is not the whole story.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_114.wav|42|It is, honestly, difficult to write about this.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_220.wav|26|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_034.wav|92|We thought we would never see them again.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_410.wav|78|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_240.wav|27|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_314.wav|60|And that match was played in June.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_135.wav|64|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_350.wav|36|He did a good job.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_196.wav|92|Recent reports suggested it might be sold off.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_140.wav|57|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_099.wav|60|It was the dreaded sentence.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_294.wav|42|Someone else can do the cooking that night.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_320.wav|106|We represent a wide range of society.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_304.wav|94|A new school will be built.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_151.wav|92|However, everyone should do it once in their life.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_131.wav|97|Mr Wilson had two brothers and three sisters.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_257.wav|41|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_281.wav|77|It would create a Scottish secretary with a lot of weight.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_102.wav|10|And does it ?
DUMMY2/p323/p323_316.wav|34|The council's concern is very simple.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_055.wav|107|The days of empty promises are over.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_245.wav|93|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_332.wav|8|He will go a long way.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_408.wav|15|He declined to be more specific.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_017.wav|91|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_376.wav|26|We knew we had the goal we wanted.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_238.wav|34|Who can say?
DUMMY2/p225/p225_089.wav|101|Officers recovered a second body in the area.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_149.wav|85|I hope it is a good omen.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_312.wav|12|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_258.wav|98|When will you listen?
DUMMY2/p259/p259_082.wav|7|The city council is a major property owner in the area.)
DUMMY2/p374/p374_136.wav|11|Does it make a profit?
DUMMY2/p294/p294_395.wav|104|The council's concern is very simple.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_271.wav|103|I might also completely change the routine.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_419.wav|50|The case will now go to appeal.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_061.wav|99|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_295.wav|6|It should be equal.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_136.wav|67|So the European elections are extremely important.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_036.wav|86|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_222.wav|82|That was a disgraceful performance.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_358.wav|40|It is a memorial.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_026.wav|59|But it failed.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_013.wav|41|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_350.wav|37|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
DUMMY2/p301/p301_006.wav|91|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_189.wav|61|Four policemen were wounded.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_185.wav|88|There are two offerings from Scotland.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_101.wav|99|That time is not now, however.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_278.wav|28|Which is a shame.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_152.wav|56|It's never great to finish second.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_228.wav|100|And the World Cup has not even begun.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_014.wav|59|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_214.wav|25|That is an important part of our role.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_146.wav|53|Look, George W Bush will come here in two months.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_123.wav|24|It has been a nightmare of frustration.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_354.wav|26|The salary changes are long overdue.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_184.wav|21|Footage has been passed on to the police.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_312.wav|49|He wasn't ready to cope with the pressures.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_067.wav|46|My game is in pretty good shape.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_335.wav|28|We have now no choice.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_309.wav|84|We want to play at the worlds.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_340.wav|25|I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_417.wav|18|They are looking for partners.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_125.wav|60|It was all very good stuff.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_141.wav|39|What do we want to do that for ?
DUMMY2/p281/p281_362.wav|36|Neither woman has been named.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_060.wav|79|We will be patient but we will win.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_333.wav|2|Three years ago he would have been.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_161.wav|69|He can do no wrong.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_100.wav|51|His team management was protective.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_283.wav|19|Funding needs to be long term.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_286.wav|4|We also hope to meet the men.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_120.wav|41|They were behind the wheel.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_011.wav|32|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. )
DUMMY2/p294/p294_033.wav|104|The airport was even different.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_366.wav|62|You've gotten all the facts.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_037.wav|44|Others may be trying to catch up.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_321.wav|102|I got a yellow card.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_324.wav|69|It sounded as if it might well be tragic.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_315.wav|105|I am so upset.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_203.wav|68|You can be sure we will have problems.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_214.wav|80|It's all about money, money, money.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_243.wav|14|They have to be able to play the game.)
DUMMY2/p312/p312_401.wav|62|We must do well in that.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_235.wav|103|This is my new career.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_043.wav|3|That means an extra two years.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_040.wav|90|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_323.wav|105|It is so unfair.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_043.wav|83|The ambition this year is to improve on last.
DUMMY2/p295/p295_378.wav|92|General, You didn't get a modified.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_097.wav|82|So far this season this approach is working.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_115.wav|40|In the current outbreak, the reverse is true.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_196.wav|5|They've got three-quarters of the way.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_273.wav|107|And that's good news for the magpies.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_139.wav|85|I've won the British.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_259.wav|6|It is not a soap opera.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_209.wav|58|On that they agree.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_162.wav|93|I was in the train station overnight.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_118.wav|93|This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_441.wav|95|We know about the crisis in cattle.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_311.wav|95|It was never a free kick.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_016.wav|42|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_246.wav|103|I'm delighted with how he has come through.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_240.wav|11|He's very, very lucky to be alive.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_389.wav|94|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_286.wav|55|The future might well be green after all.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_384.wav|91|It looks like paradise.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_339.wav|40|Yet, for the money, he was not the man of the match.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_173.wav|39|It is an attitude of mind.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_263.wav|0|It was the climax of the thing.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_320.wav|13|Scotland is too small a country for that.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_391.wav|48|How are you, sir ?
DUMMY2/p299/p299_036.wav|58|He was arrested, but later released without charge.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_190.wav|91|Morale is very high, despite the growing risks.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_450.wav|27|Was it worth it?
DUMMY2/p345/p345_242.wav|82|Surely it should be the other way round.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_013.wav|62|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_250.wav|102|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_359.wav|99|He later became a respected High Court judge.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_289.wav|51|I'm not putting myself down.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_305.wav|106|A winter of discontent awaits.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_078.wav|38|I couldn't make out what was going on.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_385.wav|107|It is a triumphant performance, which defies the years.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_263.wav|66|This time, there were no such rewards.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_123.wav|68|In that case, we would be prepared to defend ourselves.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_064.wav|75|Then followed a bout of flu.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_410.wav|65|But British scientists were not convinced by the findings.)
DUMMY2/p279/p279_115.wav|25|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_150.wav|6|I didn't really expect to be called up.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_416.wav|37|However, civil rights campaigners welcomed the ruling.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_164.wav|2|They are not advertised.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_237.wav|31|You should always be able to get out in some direction.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_011.wav|75|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_083.wav|102|They are not an item.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_288.wav|99|The release attracted little attention.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_145.wav|18|I certainly think it should be there.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_235.wav|35|It is the voice of the survivors.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_098.wav|104|I gave him a way out, and he took it.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_380.wav|40|It's a real problem.
DUMMY2/p266/p266_412.wav|20|In that case, we would be prepared to defend ourselves.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_380.wav|96|I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_320.wav|67|It's not even finished.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_180.wav|74|Are you the man from The Herald?
DUMMY2/p264/p264_285.wav|65|They have the cash and the fire power.)
DUMMY2/p313/p313_298.wav|76|We did discuss the Lockerbie issue.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_094.wav|27|He was possessed
DUMMY2/p326/p326_343.wav|28|Both are national treasures.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_283.wav|97|The way forward is working with other disciplines.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_134.wav|57|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_137.wav|55|It's nice to see a very positive style of football.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_361.wav|31|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_258.wav|17|We certainly did enough to win it, but didn't.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_307.wav|95|It was an easy decision to come here.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_412.wav|38|Sub Not Used, McArthur.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_136.wav|34|I'm just glad that no-one was hurt.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_371.wav|24|I was delighted to accept.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_033.wav|69|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
DUMMY2/p335/p335_055.wav|49|There are schoolboys in uniform.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_075.wav|2|He is in the queue.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_172.wav|64|It's going to be epic.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_243.wav|95|I'm just a regular person.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_171.wav|100|Why change it ?
DUMMY2/p364/p364_092.wav|88|But this has already been rejected.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_403.wav|32|We're not taking any risks.)
DUMMY2/p283/p283_469.wav|95|Ms Jackson was not present to put her case.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_276.wav|69|Dialogue is the key.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_110.wav|39|In the end we made too many errors.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_227.wav|11|He is doing just that.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_228.wav|33|I grew up with them.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_399.wav|79|This idea is a good starting point.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_276.wav|18|That sort of thing is long gone.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_236.wav|17|I don't think the Saudis will lay down.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_058.wav|10|Let's hope that it does.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_298.wav|70|There were no passengers on board.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_048.wav|19|We were very much a happy family.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_265.wav|0|I've had no discussions with the chairman or the board.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_359.wav|50|But they have taken the lesson to heart.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_109.wav|79|Talk of a crisis is absurd.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_192.wav|101|However, this idea is never developed.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_197.wav|3|He has defended the system.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_324.wav|79|We are very proud of him.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_115.wav|62|This looks like it's anything but open.
DUMMY2/p282/p282_302.wav|83|There's no evidence he was ever there.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_287.wav|77|He was dead on arrival at hospital.
DUMMY2/p360/p360_325.wav|60|For me, any manager is good.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_376.wav|89|You can cope with it.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_039.wav|5|Indeed, he does.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_037.wav|51|There are some serious ethical issues involved.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_221.wav|75|I won't make an official complaint.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_180.wav|63|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_127.wav|104|People will see this over time.
DUMMY2/p347/p347_288.wav|46|I mean it happens.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_301.wav|88|Is he any good?
DUMMY2/p286/p286_097.wav|63|Had I heard ?
DUMMY2/p311/p311_247.wav|4|I believe in theatre.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_381.wav|45|However, it's good to turn the page.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_155.wav|43|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_211.wav|97|Our plans for Dunfermline have not changed.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_416.wav|24|The breakdown was much later in her life.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_178.wav|69|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_398.wav|28|Then he did it twice.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_392.wav|79|They would have to go to the Royal.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_050.wav|41|It's a crucial award.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_376.wav|62|Gordon Brown was superb.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_209.wav|39|However, this idea is never developed.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_275.wav|99|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_387.wav|103|There is no dispute with the Iraqi people.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_233.wav|64|That is very, very bad news for our nation.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_387.wav|104|He is in the queue.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_231.wav|95|Consumers have the right to choose.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_332.wav|100|That meant the search was unlawful.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_172.wav|2|One season, they might do well.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_052.wav|95|I would say the position is open.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_350.wav|64|I didn't want to ignore the punters.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_288.wav|73|I can live with it.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_229.wav|4|It should be scrapped.
DUMMY2/p232/p232_070.wav|96|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_292.wav|94|It was a virus.
DUMMY2/p303/p303_276.wav|44|Drugs and housebreaking are linked.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_323.wav|45|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_073.wav|64|My game is in pretty good shape.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_407.wav|42|One policeman was killed.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_414.wav|37|Defensive stocks attracted some interest.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_325.wav|23|You've gotten all the facts.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_027.wav|104|It means we have to have some patience.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_280.wav|80|There's nothing I can say.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_155.wav|95|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_049.wav|52|Has the conflict started ?
DUMMY2/p247/p247_022.wav|14|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. )
DUMMY2/p311/p311_029.wav|4|It was a matter of chance.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_230.wav|54|Everything was up for grabs.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_010.wav|54|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_384.wav|52|What do we do ?
DUMMY2/p267/p267_106.wav|0|I was always a little behind.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_327.wav|54|We are now up against it.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_298.wav|58|However, there are also many areas of agreement.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_412.wav|37|Low pay is endemic in the National Health Service.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_311.wav|78|But it is important for a number of reasons.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_233.wav|11|We are very happy with the verdict.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_070.wav|10|Even the one she loved.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_457.wav|8|We will deal with the refugees.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_088.wav|89|He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_053.wav|79|It is an important step forward.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_275.wav|29|This is no reflection on Rangers.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_290.wav|51|That is highly unfair.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_215.wav|41|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_399.wav|64|In the end, it will mean an awful lot.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_061.wav|34|It is very difficult.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_185.wav|31|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_139.wav|36|But the main thing will be to avoid the bunkers.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_368.wav|50|We regret that they're brought in the first place.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_218.wav|74|I am feeling a bit better.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_389.wav|64|Have we not had the rainy season already?
DUMMY2/p301/p301_321.wav|91|The observer saw no evidence of fighting.
DUMMY2/p229/p229_217.wav|67|We will give a formal response to the report in due course.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_257.wav|54|Israel has done very little until now.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_353.wav|42|The professor said the results were positive.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_264.wav|31|I am very angry.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_370.wav|10|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_110.wav|22|People want to see me on the screen.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_302.wav|17|Our young people are leaving.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_235.wav|50|The irony was not lost.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_265.wav|7|Did it work ?)
DUMMY2/p287/p287_406.wav|77|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.

DUMMY2/p244/p244_365.wav|78|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_073.wav|107|That alibi is now gone.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_020.wav|1|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_039.wav|18|We were in Italy  suddenly, we knew.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_346.wav|54|Their three other children had died as infants.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_411.wav|65|They like big name players.)
DUMMY2/p236/p236_332.wav|75|These days will be back.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_069.wav|62|It is still with Ministers.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_014.wav|4|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_254.wav|100|It was a poor performance.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_217.wav|17|There was no cohesion.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_082.wav|85|Most of them have already gone home.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_059.wav|30|Within six minutes, they were two goals down.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_172.wav|3|I have had a good life.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_382.wav|95|What do they want us to do ?
DUMMY2/p364/p364_028.wav|88|I love you so very much.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_436.wav|24|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_197.wav|91|I want him to take on Gomez.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_386.wav|65|They want the style of the sound changed a bit.)
DUMMY2/p347/p347_046.wav|46|Peter, of course, refuses to conform.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_422.wav|105|But it may take some time to confirm the findings.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_299.wav|36|This is the correct decision.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_075.wav|89|There was an e-mail.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_136.wav|99|Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_243.wav|53|Does the name matter ?
DUMMY2/p228/p228_186.wav|57|We knew nothing about it.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_250.wav|51|And what is she escaping from?
DUMMY2/p310/p310_387.wav|17|They were unconfirmed reports that it was a cannabis.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_361.wav|68|I'm delighted with how he has come through.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_160.wav|104|I am the Son of Sam.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_189.wav|47|Peace was won.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_263.wav|72|People have been wonderful beyond belief.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_328.wav|22|He is young but not too young.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_291.wav|37|Even more harrowing, though, was the reception from her husband and manager.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_465.wav|50|She has now been registered as disabled.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_375.wav|21|You have to do your research.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_217.wav|91|They were later discharged from hospital.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_238.wav|54|Usually, you should leave it alone in the box.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_410.wav|24|Growth will come later in the cycle.

DUMMY2/p245/p245_033.wav|59|I was an athlete.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_228.wav|73|You should be.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_184.wav|34|It would be difficult to argue with that.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_334.wav|22|There is no answer to it.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_259.wav|5|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_135.wav|72|It was a takeover.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_150.wav|84|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.

DUMMY2/p329/p329_142.wav|103|And he had much need.

DUMMY2/p292/p292_141.wav|13|It is a road of death.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_371.wav|6|However, it was well worth the wait.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_329.wav|48|He was admitted to hospital.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_161.wav|70|Well, he should know.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_067.wav|66|And who would argue with that?

DUMMY2/p278/p278_033.wav|10|It carried a double message.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_249.wav|22|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_348.wav|107|Everything else is a bonus.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_190.wav|78|However, he urged the trade to keep the faith.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_421.wav|0|Nobody should believe this story.
DUMMY2/p283/p283_011.wav|95|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_068.wav|13|His record with England was not good.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_073.wav|81|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_207.wav|21|He is helping police with their inquiries.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_285.wav|22|It was an empowering journey.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_408.wav|54|I didn't do too badly myself.
DUMMY2/p227/p227_050.wav|29|That is very hard, alone.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_037.wav|73|Dancing was her life.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_168.wav|57|I've put my own money into this project.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_374.wav|37|It didn't matter who was in their way.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_322.wav|51|He wasn't ready to cope with the pressures.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_006.wav|58|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_256.wav|78|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
DUMMY2/p231/p231_386.wav|50|The Internet is no substitute for customer service.
DUMMY2/p251/p251_068.wav|9|That was the easy election.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_451.wav|100|The funding is now there.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_364.wav|35|We put our bid in last night.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_161.wav|51|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_074.wav|15|She's afraid of life.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_211.wav|24|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_246.wav|56|I think, therefore I am ?
DUMMY2/p259/p259_270.wav|7|He was good, but not that good.)
DUMMY2/p297/p297_222.wav|42|There has been no reaction from them.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_244.wav|105|He said he was impressed by the set-up at Celtic.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_266.wav|104|We didn't turn it into the inspectors.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_231.wav|91|He said because people had invited him.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_302.wav|30|I am a wealthy person.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_116.wav|22|The motive for the shooting was not known.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_405.wav|87|The two clubs have agreed the transfer fee.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_164.wav|28|But it's a subtle process.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_285.wav|16|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_022.wav|64|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p316/p316_239.wav|85|The following year, they asked him again.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_336.wav|103|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_195.wav|66|Felt good about it.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_156.wav|7|So I got a blood test.)
DUMMY2/p226/p226_023.wav|43|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_257.wav|10|I was just getting over the time difference.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_235.wav|3|The conference is the first test.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_049.wav|5|The State would provide.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_196.wav|3|Clearly, they had other problems.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_030.wav|100|We will look into it.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_340.wav|19|I'm pleased to get through the opening match.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_098.wav|22|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_261.wav|15|I can't deny that fact.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_198.wav|88|You would be wrong.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_460.wav|75|The chief constable has retired.
DUMMY2/p228/p228_045.wav|57|Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_379.wav|38|He said to me, Which one, son?
DUMMY2/p228/p228_202.wav|57|It's the same old story.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_086.wav|32|This is a complex and detailed report.)
DUMMY2/p316/p316_230.wav|85|We all knew it could not be true.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_276.wav|47|It happens from time to time.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_004.wav|27|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_340.wav|106|Tell me today and I will make a business decision tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_104.wav|11|Sadly, it took a tragedy to change things.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_055.wav|11|I suspect the latter.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_178.wav|19|Any error is severely punished.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_357.wav|55|What are they for ?
DUMMY2/p241/p241_314.wav|86|Craig is a major concern for us.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_438.wav|32|Strangely enough I felt very sharp.)
DUMMY2/p266/p266_259.wav|20|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_137.wav|65|This is a separate announcement which is in a different league.)
DUMMY2/p271/p271_055.wav|27|I was inspired by two things.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_172.wav|69|Does that put pressure on us?
DUMMY2/p267/p267_367.wav|0|She is now on the back benches.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_014.wav|63|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_118.wav|88|It has been a great success.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_368.wav|72|My neighbours are horrified.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_173.wav|56|This youngster is so exciting!
DUMMY2/p230/p230_044.wav|35|That was the theory, anyway.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_002.wav|36|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_081.wav|35|They lived for their children.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_363.wav|82|It is a road of death.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_353.wav|66|I can't stop people thinking.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_229.wav|12|You can feel at home in China.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_239.wav|6|I'm so looking forward to it.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_320.wav|87|And we have the experience.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_306.wav|76|It may well have been.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_372.wav|105|I'm pleased about one thing.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_140.wav|11|The whole region is in shock.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_083.wav|62|I've played them all in the Champions League.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_269.wav|17|I think it is totally wrong.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_161.wav|61|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_357.wav|22|They were the best team, but unlucky in the end.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_414.wav|1|It's nothing to do with me.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_069.wav|75|It is a job creation scheme.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_289.wav|25|It was hopeless.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_117.wav|65|Therefore, no-one can work full time in these companies.)
DUMMY2/p335/p335_257.wav|49|That gives us a bit of a chance.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_208.wav|1|We began to walk down.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_123.wav|16|There were no grounds for his action.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_018.wav|74|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_026.wav|34|Film music was never the same again.
DUMMY2/p284/p284_341.wav|16|He was the architect.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_355.wav|105|It is a large number.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_205.wav|2|He knows a lot.
DUMMY2/p262/p262_121.wav|45|So the European elections are extremely important.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_084.wav|28|They were two different types.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_074.wav|47|Is there a new way forward?
DUMMY2/p263/p263_213.wav|39|He should emerge as the winner.
DUMMY2/p260/p260_281.wav|81|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
DUMMY2/p258/p258_305.wav|26|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
DUMMY2/p300/p300_222.wav|102|That was a stunning drive from Jon.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_142.wav|59|Was this element always there?
DUMMY2/p336/p336_417.wav|98|They want to prove a point.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_028.wav|22|The law has got to be upheld.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_335.wav|3|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_438.wav|36|I didn't get to keep it.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_423.wav|98|Tonight is very special.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_080.wav|100|We have to offer value for money.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_244.wav|23|It gave me something to focus on.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_133.wav|104|I can lead by example.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_146.wav|88|The casting of her husband was an accident.
DUMMY2/p312/p312_269.wav|62|She would say he was still the best.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_392.wav|40|What happened in the summer?
DUMMY2/p228/p228_184.wav|57|I drove the ball well.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_023.wav|24|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_350.wav|100|Thousands of British tourists were trapped in their hotels.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_258.wav|1|Here is a weather forecast for the weekend.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_194.wav|1|No government has that right.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_312.wav|33|Either system could have prevented the crash.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_047.wav|4|That fight begins today for freedom and liberty.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_288.wav|76|We have it on video.
DUMMY2/p301/p301_080.wav|91|Ferguson did not hesitate.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_168.wav|69|We've all had the shots.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_375.wav|27|I am a wealthy person.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_360.wav|86|We are looking for perfection.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_096.wav|68|The League of Nations was also his idea.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_122.wav|101|I didn't feel under any pressure.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_350.wav|2|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_121.wav|25|Who would have?
DUMMY2/p239/p239_308.wav|48|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_216.wav|3|It was a management problem in the hospital.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_095.wav|22|I have no plans to change the oath.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_221.wav|64|A Treasury spokesman derided the Tory charge.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_316.wav|74|You know it was good fun.
DUMMY2/p281/p281_459.wav|36|We are going through the process.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_146.wav|100|Like the others, he was arrested.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_325.wav|15|Is that what people want?
DUMMY2/p262/p262_100.wav|45|Oil embargo endorsed.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_090.wav|94|He put some colour into Scottish history.
DUMMY2/p248/p248_255.wav|99|Kirkwood was arrested.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_200.wav|52|The police insisted that they were standard issue.
DUMMY2/p330/p330_204.wav|1|She was right about the struggle.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_089.wav|43|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_225.wav|71|"However, no further action was taken by police."
DUMMY2/p272/p272_090.wav|69|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_108.wav|61|I did not think about the Ryder Cup.
DUMMY2/p302/p302_279.wav|30|Scottish Women appear at Eden Court, Inverness, tonight.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_113.wav|28|The site has been fully recorded and surveyed.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_299.wav|104|We started from scratch.
DUMMY2/p230/p230_055.wav|35|There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_211.wav|7|What was the matter for concern ?)
DUMMY2/p303/p303_154.wav|44|That gives us something to kick against.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_277.wav|94|They wanted the club to make money.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_377.wav|47|It was a funny game.
DUMMY2/p334/p334_056.wav|38|Why do it?
DUMMY2/p245/p245_317.wav|59|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_247.wav|8|It had so much to do with output.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_216.wav|68|People are so negative about the whole business.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_403.wav|37|That remains the unanswered question.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_195.wav|24|They were seriously after him.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_330.wav|101|We are a peaceful people.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_317.wav|103|Nelson does not disappoint.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_051.wav|4|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_243.wav|42|But they didn't much like that.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_355.wav|75|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
DUMMY2/p299/p299_402.wav|58|Women reported more depression than men.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_090.wav|18|In fact, he took it very well.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_076.wav|61|The price cuts are really exciting.
DUMMY2/p286/p286_127.wav|63|In addition, investor choice is reduced.
DUMMY2/p305/p305_060.wav|54|There is no mandate for a regime change.
DUMMY2/p253/p253_117.wav|70|Tony Blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from Dublin.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_114.wav|17|Drugs and housebreaking are linked.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_225.wav|6|We don't come here for our health.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_184.wav|80|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_320.wav|79|I have some comments.
DUMMY2/p268/p268_166.wav|87|They exist in name alone.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_062.wav|12|This, he told the committee, was not forthcoming.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_261.wav|13|We will not tolerate it.
DUMMY2/p333/p333_295.wav|64|We are the British National Party, not the English National Party.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_148.wav|69|The role of the law lords would be retained.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_390.wav|68|But we'll just keep trying to get results.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_291.wav|0|They were on holiday in Egypt.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_213.wav|6|I think it must be the uniforms.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_118.wav|65|But I am in practice.)
DUMMY2/p239/p239_013.wav|48|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_228.wav|11|The night is young.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_351.wav|15|It doesn't make me feel any better.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_402.wav|98|We owe it to the public of Strathclyde.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_092.wav|42|The scientific debate is dead.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_318.wav|59|There was no time scale.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_010.wav|76|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_239.wav|18|There are two mysteries.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_111.wav|40|It is a financial matter.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_104.wav|42|If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_252.wav|13|This could prove a problem.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_312.wav|101|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
DUMMY2/p266/p266_166.wav|20|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_222.wav|105|He demanded to speak to the boss.
DUMMY2/p274/p274_105.wav|32|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.)
DUMMY2/p266/p266_405.wav|20|I knew the script.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_152.wav|11|That's the important thing.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_185.wav|4|It feels that the game is off.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_198.wav|106|That admission is not surprising.
DUMMY2/p225/p225_120.wav|101|The industry is not well organised.
DUMMY2/p299/p299_405.wav|58|Nothing has been going for us, but what can you do?
DUMMY2/p229/p229_075.wav|67|It works for us.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_374.wav|34|The answer is mayhem.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_190.wav|74|I think it was just a tragic accident.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_152.wav|86|They were later discharged from hospital.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_079.wav|28|I am immensely proud of them.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_255.wav|17|We went on to become very successful.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_275.wav|61|I have never been a close friend of Jim McLean.
DUMMY2/p298/p298_368.wav|68|It was also put on the Internet.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_166.wav|33|It feels that the game is off.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_002.wav|2|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_343.wav|89|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_275.wav|26|Lottery money was intended to be used for good causes.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_287.wav|47|The death toll included five children.
DUMMY2/p293/p293_389.wav|23|He is very unlikely to feature against Ireland.
DUMMY2/p314/p314_326.wav|51|He will address the nation this evening.
DUMMY2/p317/p317_084.wav|97|This has not, and has been neglected.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_297.wav|86|Our task is to complete the picture.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_137.wav|25|You've got to be vigilant.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_047.wav|56|I expect a rapid response.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_110.wav|84|We are currently working on the details.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_225.wav|73|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
DUMMY2/p341/p341_016.wav|66|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p318/p318_297.wav|19|What's the point of staying sober?
DUMMY2/p243/p243_029.wav|53|The Budget is a boost for Scottish business.
DUMMY2/p275/p275_251.wav|40|Kirkwood was arrested.
